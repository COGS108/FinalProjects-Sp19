POSITIVE	Had this several times already, just now getting around to reviewing it.  It's a solid Scotch Ale, pours semi-thick with a quick fading head, nice dark brown color. Rich caramel flavor with a sweet malt overtone. Definitely above average. A little thin on the body but the ABV isn't noticeable. Finishes smooth and just a hint of dryness. Overall it's a very good scotch ale and worth the price.
POSITIVE	Pours with a loose creamy tan root beer head that rings when poured quickly (as recommended) and ruby brown body. Kabanossi nose, with some wood, spiced plum, and Band-aids - deep. Smoke but also prune, cherry and brown sugar with prickly allspice and herbal hops. Astringent smoke finish. Light, crisp, round, creamy.  Pretty big and sweet for a Marzen. For such a non-traditional (or more traditional, actually) beer, spectacularly balanced, layered and drinkable. I've forgotten the smoke by the 3rd sip. Is this the best smoked beer out there?
POSITIVE	On tap at Party Towns "Founders Tasting" in Covington, KY on FEB 26,2010.  This review is a from the 1/2 growler fill I took home with me.  This beer pours a murky dark brown with a medium tan, small foamy head. Light lacing is seeing after the head quickly settles leaving a characteristic "halo" around the edge of my chalice.  The smell is just fantastic. Big bourbon and thick maple syrup adorn this one. I get light vegetal or Earthy notes with a wallop of oak woodiness in this. Wow...  The taste reflects the nose. Very big and complex, but soothing and velvety all around. The flavor captures your taste buds, but then gently fades in a molasses sweetness and vanilla mix. I get an appealing musty quality, as well, which is likely do to the old ale base. Beyond the woody, bourbon nose, I don't get any hot alcohol bite.  Amazingly creamy or velvety mouthfeel. Low carbonation and slick. Wow, it's hypnotic... Try this one if you get the chance, it's fantastic.
POSITIVE	Undated 12oz twist top stubby poured into a pint glass.  Clear crimson with a huge, Whitish pink head that leaves globs of lace.  Smells of real raspberries, not berry flavoring. Some floral hops underneath pair well with the berry tartness.  The raspberries are also strong in the taste, with the suggestion of hop bitterness again working with the berries. Not much else going on, but I do appreciate tasting real berries instead of generic berry juice/synthetic flavoring.  Moderate to light mouthfeel. Unimpressive but I don't see anything fuller helping this one out. This could be a good hot day beer, or a good one to pair with poultry.
POSITIVE	A slightly hazy golden-peach colour with a fairly large white head. Head retention isn't bad, and lacing sticks.  Fairly grainy aroma. A little bit of shampoo. Smells ok.  Smooth fruity malt into a faintly grainy hop finish. Nothing wild here, just a straightforward taste. It works.  This beer has a touch of body to it and is readily carbonated. Better than the average strong lager body.  This beer stays away from the typical strong euro lager downfalls by keeping it simple. In the end it is an easy drinker considering its ABV.
POSITIVE	Pours thick and rich with certainly one of the darkest heads I've ever seen. Nice density to the head and it leaves lacing as it settles. Coffee black. Rich aroma of coffee noted initially. Holds an interesting sweetness, that I suppose could be the oatmeal, but also has a zip with the hops (grass, forest green). Wow what a whole lot of flavors. Excuse me if i neglect some of this cornucopia of taste. Starts with the coffee that shows a tad of sharp taste and bitterness but once it's gone all the traditional beery flavors show with hops making a strong presence in the acceptable bitterness and green wild grassy taste. There is the makings of a dark fruit (close to dark berry) in the making, but it doesn't come to fruition (so to speak). Incredibly long finish of bitterness, with coffee and hop flavors. Quite a bit of carbonation, especially for style. Seems to make it thinner than maybe it actually is.  Drinks well enough for style. The strong full flavors lend it to wanting to take small drinks to savor the flavors. Glad I have a second bottle as I think aging will make this truly wonderful instead of merely very good. Rich flavors and body now holds a sharpness from its youth that I would prefer to not experience. Thanks S.H. for the trade.
POSITIVE	12oz bottle in Duvel tulip bottled 0/27/09  A: Pours a dark brown color, looks like a dark english brown ale. There is no sign of a head and only a slight hint of off-white lace. S: A definite "bourbon-ness", some wood and vanilla scents along with some sweetness, no sign of hops. T: The bourbon is very upfront, not overpowering, but definitely there. The malt character that I expect in a Wee Heavy is not apparent or is hidden under the bourbon. There is absolutely no sign of the alcohol M: There are some drying tannins here which help to prevent this from being cloying. A medium level of attenuation combined with just enough carbonation also help a lot.  D: A nice beer, not too overpowering with the bourbon character, at the same time, it seems a little one dimensional. I just read my review of Dirty Bastard and it seems like some of that goodness is missing. I like this beer, but don't love it. May have to revisit in the future. Worth trying if you are a bourbon fan or really like barrel aged beers.
NEGATIVE	Can with a distinctive lime green pop tab, poured into a pint glass, picked up at Corks and Kegs in Richmond, VA.  Pours tawny amber brown (Yuengling-ish?) with a poofy, rocky, eggshell-tan head that dissipates slowly and leaves a bit of lace. Decent look.  Smell is a sucker punch in the nostrils. Not sure what I was expecting from this brew, but the nose was a big surprise. Overhwelmingly bitter and floral, with caramel sweetness singing backup. Maybe I should start believing some of the hype about cans preserving the beer so well.  As surprising as the pungency of the smell was the incongruity of the flavor profile. Just plain uninteresting in contrast to the huge nose- a dash of floral hops, not a ton but enough to outweigh the barely-there malt backbone. Out of balance and generally weak.   Seems like some soft, mellow bitterness evolves once the beer is gone. In fact, I think I enjoy this beer more after the swallow.   Decently smooth and inoffensive, but not worth a second visit.
POSITIVE	This beer has a clear copper body that leads to an excellent off white almost tan head. There is great lace and head retention. The aroma is sweet and cereal like. The flavor has lots of biscuit like esters with a little bit of yeast hemp and hop fruitiness. The rye brings some spice to the game. The mouthfeel is slick and medium.
POSITIVE	A: Black. Small 1/2" head. No light coming through at all. Thick as motor oil. The way an imperial should look.  S: chocolate and dried fruits up front. Some booze. Sweet smelling and malty.  T: Molasses and raisins stand out. Followed by smokey dark chocolate and burnt oats. Mild coffee type finish.  M: Thick and creamy. Goes down smooth. Slight after burn from the alcohol  O: Good beer. Give it a try.
POSITIVE	A: Pours a dark ruby red, almost brown color. A small bubbly white head forms, and leaves little lace. S: Malty sweet with some yeast. Dark fruits of plums and raisins. A light banana and citrus aroma. Dry wood. Lots of subtle complexities. T: Similar to the nose. Malty sweet. Some caramel. Dark fruits and dry wood. M/D: A medium body with good carbonation. Crisp and dry. Not a session beer. The alcohol shows a bit. Though this is a good beer to sip on.  A good Dubbel. One of my favorite styles, and Pike does it right. Something I would recommend.
NEGATIVE	Appearance: Clear and golden, with a massive white head. Extremely well carbonated.  Aroma: Lemony hops, slight malty sweetness, and a little bready grain.   Taste: Crisp and bitterly hoppy.   Mouthfeel: Lively and light.   Drinkability: A light refreshing pilsener, which is easy to drink. Better than a lot of the crap imported lager on the market, just a shame they couldn't shell out for a brown glass bottle
NEGATIVE	Had tonight at Asmara in central square. Very cold 330cc bottle served with an unfortunately chilled tall narrow stange glass. Beer pours very reddish brown color with almost no head. Aroma is very faint, but vaguely sweet and adjunct-malty.  The first sip is sharp with carbonation and not much else. The coldness amplifies this. The flavor is also sweet and vaguely malty but there's not much else going on here. It does taste fairly lagery for a stout. I really have no idea how beeradvocate came up with the "Russian Imperial Stout" designation. It's all of 5.5% abv -- and has none of the flavor profile.  The bottle says "Hakim Stout (Dark Beer)". As a dark beer, like a sweet brown ale, it's merely bad. As a stout, it's quite possibly the worst example of a stout I've ever had.
POSITIVE	Guest tap at Flyers.  A: Deep chestnut-brown, light tan head, slight retention, good lace.  S: Vanilla & nut-bread.  T: Vanilla, biscuity malt, light nut & caramel, hint of citrus hops.  M: Light to moderate body is smooth & creamy, with a dry finish; moderate carbonation.  D: Fairly drinkable.  I think it's more of a brown ale than a porter.
NEGATIVE	Bomber poured into a Duvel tulip. No dating on the bottle or label. Clear, amber body with red highlights. Darker than I would have expected for an IPA. One-finger tan head that sticks around for a while and leaves a smattering of lacing around the glass.  The first aroma is definitely from the hops - piney and grassy. But, the predominant aroma as I go down the glass is the malt. Definite predominant caramel and maple malt aroma.  Well, I'm a little disappointed in the flavor. The hops are definitely taking a back seat to the malt. No doubt, there are hops in the blend, but the malt is more forward, so it does follow the aroma fairly closely.  The mouthfeel is of a medium thickness. Of course, with no dating, this bottle could be older with faded hops, but I'll never know. Average IPA at best.
POSITIVE	A HUGE thanks to my long time friend Redboot (Karl) for sending a few Founders my way. This is my first review from the 4 pack that he sent me.  A - A beautiful dark yellow orange straw color. Cloudy with a very nice head that stays around for some time. Nice lacing that travels down the class as the beer is consumed.  S - This beer hits your nose as soon as the bottle is opened. Very impressive. Light citrus notes that mix very nicely with the light hops and barley smell. Wonderful smell. Very clean and fresh. Almost got a 5 but I am always very careful about awarding a 5. Close though.  T - Well, here we go... First sip coming up. Hops and barley. More bitter than I was expecting but very nice. Not at all sweet which is nice for this very nicely crafted Pale Ale. You can definitely taste the Dry Hops. Makes the mouth cry out and want more. Again, very good.   M - Good. Nice carbonization that plays with the nose. Somewhat thin but a good quality for this type of beer. Again, very good.  D - At 5.4%, an excellent beer with lower alcohol than some others. I just wish I could this beer more often. Come to Minnesota Founders....at least your trucks.  Thanks again Karl. Founders #2 later this weekend.
NEGATIVE	There's nothing wrong with this beer... it has a nice light colour and a pleasant hoppy fragrance. Also, although it's rated a generous 4.7% alcohol by volume it, for me, slips down very easily. It has a pleasing pale colour. I liked it fine. Reccommended.
NEGATIVE	BOttle states Bottled on 11/30/06  Pours with a nice khaki head that sticks around. Smells really roasty with some coffee notes.  The taste continnues the smell with lots of roasted malt and coffee notes. The mouthfeel was nice and creamy with a good amount of carbonation for this style.
POSITIVE	Pours a quick and fizzy head. Some bare lacing is noticed. color is dark tanned amber. Smell iis a of blackberries and chalky chocolate. The taste is the same mix mix, with the blackberries in the foreground and that chalky malt in the background. The blackberry flavor is too light in my opinion. The drinkability is pretty good and the mouthfeel is like a liquid ovaltein mixed with chalk dust.
NEGATIVE	I like Founders a lot, but I have mixed feelings about this brew. It pours nicely and is quite dark, but it doesn't have the opaque blackness of something like an impy stout when held up to the light. That's okay though, since this isn't an impy stout. The profile reminds me quite of bit of Sierra Nevada's recent black barleywine. This one smells better than the SN brew, yet Nemesis doesn't taste as good. Unfortunately, Nemesis has a strong, long-lasting, soapy flavor that ruins it for me. Perhaps that is hop-related and would fade with time, but I'm not sure. Nemesis doesn't strike me as a beer that would benefit with age. Conversely, I think the SN version might improve with age. Neither brew is overly roasty or full-bodied, yet neither is as hoppy in the bitterness/taste/aroma department as I thought they might be for Amercian barleywines. Both brews oddly lack in the malt/body department and are too watery for barleywines (whether they be English, American, black, blonde, or somewhere in-between). To be honest, I don't feel the need to run out and buy more of either one. They were both fun to try once, but for me...that's enough. I'm starting to think I often don't care for the combination of dark/hoppy/sometimes-strong brews. Well, I do enjoy the Imperial Stout from Smuttynose so that's at least one dark, hoppy, strong ale I like. Perhaps there's a Black/Cascadian IPA or two I enjoy at times as well.
POSITIVE	Extra received from KJGAGNE in a recent trade. Thanks!  Bottled on 2/2/09. There's some age on this for sure. Will review accordingly. Poured into a goblet.  Pours a dark gold/orange with a thin off-white head on top. Smells of peppery hops, earth, and sweet candy. The mouth still retains a crisp, bubbly feel. Thought this would be a bit more flat. Starts out slightly sweet, but is still plenty bitter. Tons of peppery spicy hops still present. Dulled from time for sure, but still packs a punch. Gets more unbalanced as it warms. Sweetness flees, more bitterness takes its place.   There is still plenty of body and depth to this beer after 10 months. I bet this is a beast when fresh. I'll have to pick up some more next spring. Thanks for the opportunity, Kevin.
NEGATIVE	Poured from a 12oz. bottle into a pint glass. Notched label with best before June, 06. Once again thanks to kmpitz2 for this sample.  Pours a deep amber color with a one finger thick off white head. Very clear, head fades quickly, no lacing. Nice roasted nut smell, hints of molasses and roasted malt. Taste is similar to the smell, slighly bitter roasted nut taste. This beer also has some sort of chocolate malt/ chocolate lactose taste, kinda sour. It has a tootsie roll like aftertaste. Mouthfeel is a bit thin for me, decent amount of carbonation. Easy too drink, this is just not my favorite style of brew. Not bad, glad I had the chance to try it.
NEGATIVE	I paid just under $3.00 for a 1 pint 9 oz bottle, and poured it into a pint glass. It looked kind of like an English brown ale, reddish brown and clear with a thick tan foam on top. But the smell was way different. Smelled like a camp fire more than anything, but also a little like smoked ham. It doesn't sound right for a beer, but it worked for me. Tasted smoky and malty, and was very carbonated. From now on I'll recommend everyone tries this at least once.
POSITIVE	Poured from the tap into ~11oz snifter. NB. Unfortunately did not have a clean palate for this one.  Appearance - The darkness of La Cave makes judging the appearance a little difficult. The brew appears to have a rich copper or reddish color. A frothy layer of head sits atop the lowly carbonated beer. A rich, thick lacing, imitative of the head, is left behind on the glass. 4.5  Smell - Ultra-hoppy. Plenty of piney wood notes as well as some tropical fruits. Also has a kind of grassy or weedy coloring to the nose. Malts are in there but are harder to detect with the crazy amount of hops in this brew. The alcohol, high content as it is, peeks through the piney hops easily enough. 4.5  Taste - This baby is bitter, but that's just how I like my super-IPAs. The bitterness lingers infinitely. It's morning as I write this and I think the aftertaste is still there just a little bit, not with my protest of course. Piney wood notes are dominant on the tongue, with plenty of those exotic citrus flavors as well, along with a touch of that weedy flavor. Of course the alcohol comes through but that is to be expected and is not a deterrent. Very interesting and subtle - will need to try with a fresh palate. 4.5  Mouthfeel - Surprisingly easy to drink for the high ABV, though I feel like I end up saying this for most DIPAs (or, in this case, I suppose TIPAs). Definitely sticky in the mouth and on the lips, but still goes down easily. Despite the ABV, it would be possible to have a few of these in a night. 4  Overall - Pretty awesome. Just a tad too bitter to be one of my faves, but very good nonetheless, and certainly very interesting. I will have to try this again from the bottle, or as my first beer of the night from the tap, to get an even more careful read on it. 4.5
POSITIVE	bottled 10/28/09  pours ruby orange with a pillowy 1.5 finger head that fades into chunks and left lacing down th glass  smell is huge of grapefruit and some peach next to sweet carmel malts  taste is much of the same - those grapefruit hops the malts and rye are not as sweet as the nose - it has more spice -no muddy flavors very clean  mouthfeel is a medium body beer with good carbonation - a very juicy smooth brew  drinkabiltity is scary since it is almost 7abv and i want to drink the whole sixer  i have been enjoying this beer for a few years now and it never gets old - hands down this and 2bros cane & ebel are the best rye beers out there - go seek them out
POSITIVE	12oz bottle poured into tulip sept19 2010  A jet black right out of the bottle and a thumbs width of mocha head falls pretty quick but leaves some lace where it lasted  S smokey bourbon with a little bakers chocolate, coffee, vanilla and some booze   T much like the nose but even better, the bourbon is strong but not overwhelming and works for it, the chocolate tastes more like coco powder in the mouth but again it works well. I'm loving the woody earthiness and the smokey finish just wonderful stuff  M silky but a little thin and considering how dark this one is I'm a little surprised, not flat but could use some more carbonation but the flavors just stick too your gums I'll be tasting this for ages  D pretty good for a giant bold high booze stout, the taste alone is reason for another, there's a little heat from the liquor but I bet it would mellow out with some time  I can see why this beer is so highly ranked it tastes great, truly one of the better tasting beers I've had yet. A big thank you to MasterSki for sending this one my way
POSITIVE	Had on tap at the Map Room during CCBW.  Had a deep, dark color and looked quite rich in nature. I could smell the alcohol from the first inhale.  The combo of chocolate, coffee, and vanilla were noted during the drink, and even though there is an alcohol taste infused, it is not overpowering. It was very smooth and didn't have a harsh aftertaste.  The look and feel of this beer were great. I noted the slow alcohol drip back down to the bottom of the glass after a sip.   Since I have never had this beer and heard many great things, I was hoping it would meet expectations--and it did. This is a quality beer and would like to give it a taste after some maturity.
POSITIVE	Poured from a bottle into a pint glass... it's a hazy deep amber color with a finger worth of white head. Decent retention... good looking beer!  The smell is a little faint, but what's there is grapefruit hoppy.   The taste is similar... there's somewhere funny on the end that I can't place but it's not bad. It's not a bold IPA, but a decent one and really easy to drink.
NEGATIVE	This beer pours a light amber color with a small head that dies off quickly and doesn't leave much lacing on the glass. The aroma has some citrus hops as well as some dirty hops with a decent caramel backbone. The flavor is much the same, but there is much more of the dirty hop flavor (cascades, I think). Drinkability is good and the mouthfeel is moderate.
POSITIVE	A - Black and beautiful. 1 finger reddish brown head that fades quickly into thin lacing. Held up to light, cannot see through it.   S - Coffee and Booze.. Slight whiff of vanilla .   T - Coffee, Bourbon, Sweet, Goes in your mouth, into your nose, and warms everything.   M - Surprisingly smooth, coats the inside of your mouth well, and warms everything it touches.   D - If this were readily available It would be a wonderful go to beer to always drink.
NEGATIVE	On cask at Flying Saucers firkin friday, served in a shaker pint...  A- Pretty damn black, slight brown edges. Absolutely zero head or anything.   S- Cherries are there, but not in force. Roast hits before the fruit, but overall its slightly sweet and faint in aroma.  T/M- Well, not what I expected. Bland, dull, watery. What, did they put 1 cherry in the cask? Doesn't even resemble regular Onward, let alone the wonderful concoction it could be with cherries. I guess there is a slight cherry cough syrup flavor left over on the tongue that doesn't mix well with the minimal roast. On cask its much more medium bodied than regular Onward, but still its just bland and missing a lot.  O- Even for a cask this beer was dull. Just disappointing. Its a giant black hole in a glass; nothing is there... Yazoo- thank you for trying, but go balls to the walls next time, please!
POSITIVE	I'm excited for this one as many compare it to hopslam in terms of flavor.  A - Pours a hazy golden color, not really what I was expecting from an ale called "double trouble" Head is shortlived but I'm not too worried.  S - Fruity and Hoppy.  T - Not quite the amount of flavor that hopslam delivered, but still damn good. super citrusy and bitterness kicks in after. Alcohol pretty noticeable but not to bad.  M - good.  D - The bigness of this beer does not take away from its drinkability... Although 2 of these in one sitting would be enough, I could def drink them in a row.
POSITIVE	A: Dark brown with a rim of light brown foam.  S: VERY smoky (well, it should be!), with a little sweetness.  T: More smoke, almost overpowering at times. A dark, malty taste reminiscent of other marzens.  M: Very little carbonation.  D: Excellent for sipping. The taste is too strong for more than one.
POSITIVE	Poured into a nonic.  Pours an off white finger sized head that quickly fades, but leaves a thin layer on top of the brew with some residual lacing. The brew is a nice clear, deep copper color.  Smells of sweet caramel malts, raisins, toffee and some fresh baked bread along with some earthy hop.  Tastes very much as it smells - sweet caramel maltiness, raisins and maybe figs. Nicely balanced earthy herbal hop flavor that almost lends a tea quality.  Mouthfeel is thick and slick. Mildly carbonated.  Drinkability is high on this one, easily a sessionable brew.  A winter warmer, albeit lighter in abv that I would expect in a winter warmer, but having said that - it is worthy of a try.
POSITIVE	I tried this side-by-side with KBS. It is an excellent pour, but alas, I'd have to say, I much prefer the KBS.  The maple syrup character makes this just a little too sweet. KBS is already fairly sweet, but this just kicks it up a bit too much. I also prefer the aroma of KBS, but then again, that's because I love bourbon. So if you are not a fan of overly boozy bourbon barrel-aged beers, you are probably going to love this.  All of the other complexities remain. This is a very good beer that I was happy to be able to try, but falls short of being "exceptional" in my opinion.
POSITIVE	Pours almost pitch black with a dirty head that hangs around for a while. Smells strongly of coffee and chocolate. The whole thing is smooth with a bit of sweetness in the back. Tastes like VERY dark chocolate. The chocolate is much stronger on the tongue than in the nostrils. Good balance of bitter/sweetness. Has a great mouthfeel, nice and weighty. Flows smoothly down the throat. Nice drinkability all around.
POSITIVE	GABF Weekend '08 A porter as hearty as they come. This beer pours as thick as any Russian Imperial Stout. Very dark brown with a heavy brown froathy head formation with good Retention and lacing. Very bold aromas of coffee, cocoa, syrupy malts, and a lot of esters and alcohol. Flavors favor the malts and esters giving the beer a lot of molassas-type sweetness and big esters of grapes, raisons, dates, figs, and a touch of anise. The textures are heavy, sweet, and a little rough because of the alcohols- makes it a bit cough syrup-ish. Finishes with a long lingering sweetness, fruitiness, and alcohol warmth.
NEGATIVE	On tap at Harmon Poured a nice deep amber with a small white head. Nose is slightly bitter with a spice to it with earthy undertones. Taste much like it smells. Bitter in a sense but also very one dimensional. Drinkability is ok and the ABV is low so this could be a great session beer.
POSITIVE	Pre-filled, undated, growler purchased in a grocery store{!} in Asheville, just a few miles from the brewery.   Pours a hazy golden amber with a smallish white head of modest duration. A bit light for style. Leaves some lacing.   Aroma: quite floral and fruity, with noticeable yeastiness and some light malt. Plenty of sour fruit.  T - Substantial sweet and sour components with a very good sweet/sour balance, favoring sour; a slight bitterness too. Flavorful and fruity but not challenging. A great sipper.   M - smooth; medium-light body; low carbonation. I felt the carbonation should be higher, but the pre-filled growler makes it impossible to know the original/typical condition of this beer.   O - not entirely true to style, using a Belgian standard, but quite enjoyable and easily recommended.
POSITIVE	I saw a fellow BA at the CBC get a pint of this Baltic Porter delivered to him and just knew I had to order one for myself. I was drinking a 9 oz Vienna Gold at the time and I felt almost embarrassed. It's one of the prettiest beers I've ever seen! Deep, dark brown with a hint of ruby when held up to strong light. A tan frothy and foamy lasts and lasts, leaving waves of sticky lace on the side of the glass (Artful). The rich roasted malt creates a velvety and lush liquid body. Woody, chocolate, smoky, and coffee aroma and flavor. Grapefruit bitterness and lightly earthy flavors mingle with a light sweetness, and a slight alcohol and bourbon essence. A must try!
NEGATIVE	Pours a slightly clouded ruby brown with a lighter tan head. Nose is hopped and slightly cherry sweet, with a stronger overall sugary tone to it. Flavor is lacking. Seems to be a bit too traditional, but it falls off way too fast. Almost tastes like semi stale pretzels...or just pretzels in general. There is an overall bitter tone to it, but I just think it lacks. Feel is nice with a decent carbonation. Drinkable, yes. Isn't horrid, but it's definitely not the best ESB you've ever had.
NEGATIVE	Pours a dark brown with a tannish head that starts off strong and stays pretty good. Nice lace throughout. Slight aroma, coffee, chocolate, dark, smokey malts. Good taste and mouthfeel, but trails off in the end. Good finish, but was expecting more. Good beer.
POSITIVE	Poured from 500mL bottle into a pint glass. Label says this beer is 5.4% ABV, rather than the above-noted 5.2%.  Appearance: light orange hue with a little bit of murky haze. head is two fingers of frothy ivory foam. Not bad.  Smell: rich aroma with a sweet, fresh malt character and just a hint of graininess. I like it quite a lot.  Taste: nicely malty flavor which is a bit drier than the aroma would suggest. Bitterness is low but noticeable at the end. The flavor is quite simple, but it's clean and it appeals to me. Good stuff.  Mouthfeel: medium-light body with a good level of carbonation. It's a little more to the fizzy side rather than creamy, but it's got a decent enough texture.  Overall: I rather like this beer. I don't always like Oktoberfests, but this one really does work for me.
POSITIVE	Poured 12oz bottle into snifter.  A: Pitch black with a thin brown head.  S: Roasted coffee, dark & bitter chocolate, and a little bit of licorice.  T: Dark chocolate, roasted malts, coffee. Hints of hoppy bitterness and oatmeal.  M: Thick, thick, thick. Creamy, mild carbonation for a very full-body. Wonderful.  D: Have to control myself from finishing it too quickly. So well balanced, yet so intense, I could very easily drink this for a while.
NEGATIVE	A: Dark brownish red body. Just a coating of off white head. Very little lacing.  S: Bourbon and all that comes with it. Vanilla, oak, alcohol... then comes the beer... dark chocolate and caramel.. not much in the way of hops, but thats ok  D: This is like jack and coke meets beer... its rather nice... the aromas in the nose are well positioned in the taste profile.. nice bourbon finish  M: Smooth. Slightly carbonated. Slightly alcoholic burn too.  D: I don't know. For as much as I enjoyed the beer I just didn't want another. I like bourbon aged beers (including KBS/oaked aged yeti/etc) and this is the first one I wasn't willing and ready to have another.
POSITIVE	Poured from a bottle into pint glass A - jet black pour, small expresso head, lotsa lacing S - coffee, and chocolate T - even more coffee and chocolate, and some fruity nights that are hard for me to detect M - wonderfully smooth O - absolutely amazing beer, completely lived up to the hype I have heard about it, Not my favourite, or an everyday beer, but possible the best I have ever had
POSITIVE	Poured out of a bomber into my Duvel.  A - Fairly cloudy light yellow pour. Modest one inch head that stays around. Very light lacing left after each sip.  S - Light, crisp fruit smell. Has an aromatic flowery appeal to it.   T - Much more of a malt taste then expected. Makes me think of a granny smith apple. Finished off a bit dry and left just a faint sweetness in my mouth.  M - Light bodied.   D - Sure its fairly light and drinkable. It's an average offering.
NEGATIVE	Tasted by half-pint at the Baxter's Court, a JDW pub in Hackney, North London.  A: (pale) amber hue, a thin foam dissipates fast, on top of a low carbonated body; looking unlike any kind of wheat beer at all... S: a sour-salty-sweet yeasty aroma abounds, while a lease of pear juice, perry, and green apple-peel like fruity note plays the main role on the nose. Not bad, though slightly ill-structured and blurred. T: sour-sweet yeasty flavour upfront (as in many wheat beers, it's a bit like Yakult~~); savoury, pear-ish and a lighter-than-pale-malt flavour develops at the back, quickly leading to a smooth but lingering bitter and tangy aftertaste, with a tannic touch and light-bodied wheatish feel in the end. M&D: light, smooth, and refreshing on the mouthfeel. This beer is quite easy-drinking, with certain resemblance with Belgian or French witbier, but much more simplistic it is. O.K. performance.
POSITIVE	Pours out to a clear, very deep garnet, almost completely opaque, forming a soapy light-tan head with minimal retention and average lacing. Aroma is pure heaven...Schlenkerla smoke in perfect balance with caramel-tinged amber malts and fragrant German noble hops. Carbonation is mild and requires a hefty pour to form a head. Mouthfeel is oh so soft with a medium-dense body and lightly astringent, very woody and earthy finish. Taste is wonderful...these guys can pull off the style with their own unique twist...easy to tell that this is a Urbock...hefty malts with a well-balanced bitterness. This one has a metal twang in the middle, but there are other notes of prunes, maple, leather, chocolate and tobacco. The finish is exceptionally earthy, like drinking an EKU 28 in the damp Black Forest around a campfire. Heavenly.  Don't let the smoke scare you, this is a dangerously drinkable brew. This beer is truly transcendental. This brew and Coheed makes me wonderfully happy. I love the Marzen the best of the bunch, but any beer from Schlenkerla has been touched by god. Seek out, drink up, and be merry. Simply amazing.
POSITIVE	Appearance: A very dark body, even for a porter, barely reveals itself as dark rusty brown color.  Smell: Sweet shocolate and carmel. Slight grass malt, not what I was expecting from a Polish brewer (I have had too many bad euro lagers to count).  Taste: Sweet with honey, chocolate, and carmel. Dark breadiness permeates the flavor. Hops are not tremendous, but noticeable.   Mouthfeel: A little watery, but the carbonation makes up for it, good.  Drinkabilty: Versus the style, this one really shines. I think that baltics and imperials diverged, and this is one of the best Baltics I have had. Very good, worthy of it's high marks, especially against the style.  Thanks to LuckySevens82 for the 500 mL bottle.
POSITIVE	A hazy yellow body with a small white head. Not great retention, but a little bit of lacing.  A nice hoppy aroma that is floral and citric. A touch of wheat twang in the background.  Hops and a wheat backbone come together here to create a tasty, balanced beer. The hops provide some citric, grapefruti flavors that a little bit bitter but add some sweetness also. The wheat has a slightly toasted flavor and comes with a touch of bubble gum flavor.  Mouthfeel is light and crisp, moderate carbonation.  This is a pretty drinkable beer, I really enjoyed this one.
POSITIVE	A-Amber waves of grain color with an off-white head with great retention and stick.  S- a liitle caramel-nut, yeasty with an earthy hop note at the end  T- Very similat to the nose only better, the earthy hops at th end carry a mild but long lasting bittenrness that is very nice.  M-medium body, medium carbonation  D-Quite possibly the best Oktobefest I'v had in 2008
NEGATIVE	Presentation: 12 oz bottle with no freshness date to be found.  Appearance: Good frothing and great head retention, the pale amber hue shows an active carbonation and a brilliant clarity.  Smell: Odd sweetness, mild fruitiness and musty husk aroma.  Taste & Mouth Feel: Lots of husk and mildly astringent tannins in the palate right from the get go. Musty husk and a dirty malt flavor, the sweetness is a bit too much. Hops stay herbal with a harsh bitterness middle to end, faint solvent alcohol shows off the 6.0% abv.  Drinkability & Notes: This brew just does not come together well, flavors seem all misplaced and it tastes like too much protein made it into the boil  add that to the herbal hop and husk and it just does not go down well.
POSITIVE	750 ml corked and caged bottle acquired in a trade with mymrngjckt, thanks for giving me the opportunity to try this brew, shared with Drake last night, poured into my Dogfish Head snifter  A-Medium brown with dark red highlights, 3/4 inch creamy off white head that stuck around for a few minutes, some retention and no lacing  S-Faint whiskey, figs, plums, cherries, raisins, toffee, vanilla, oak, some chocolate, sweet malty aromas, sugar, bread, and caramel  T-Started off with a fairly strong bourbon taste, then mellowed into some brown sugar and bready malt, the finish was a bit watered down and weak but fortunately it was not hot and boozy, beer got a little sweeter as time went by with some dark fruit and milk chocolate coming to the surface, oak and vanilla could be faintly identified in the aftertaste later on, finish had a little more whiskey in it once the liquid fully warmed, nicely balanced overall and mellow for a barrel aged barleywine  M-Smooth mouthfeel, some warming going down but not too hot on the tongue, thin to medium body, taste lingered, lots of carbonation surprsingly  D-Could have gotten close to drinking this whole bottle by myself, pretty light for a barleywine, booze are hidden well, goes down easy, subtle  Did not like as much as the Barrel Aged Fat Dog but this was still quite good, one of the better beers I have had from Stoudt's, would definitely drink again, recommended
NEGATIVE	poured into a tulip  A.   A nice amber color with minimal head.  S.  up front is a smell of booze, like some bourbon. a little woody like it's been in a barrel.   T.   very sweet tasting. the booze hits you pretty good. some slight maple in there with a few other subtle notes, but it's a bit tricky to pick everything out with the strong boozy taste. some slight bitterness in there as well.   M.  medium bodied with low carbonation. the booze and sweetness really lingers around in the mouth.  D.  a very great tasting beer. however you must be a fan of boozy flavors like drinking liquor. the high alcohol content makes it a beer you would probably only have 1 of in a night. The minimal availability makes this a beer you'll probably have once or twice in your life as well.
NEGATIVE	Monty Python's Holy Grail Ale has a light orange colour and a crappy head that dissipates very quickly. The smell is slightly bitter and yeasty/grainy. The taste is grainy with a clean, slightly musty finish. It's quite carbonated, so it has good presence in the mouth. This beer is decent and very drinkable, but nothing exceptional.
POSITIVE	Thanks to jdoncbus for this one in the UGLY Duckling BIF. Been really wanting to try this guy!   A: Pours a deep copper with little head retention. Lot of floaties goin on around there...kinda appealing actually.   S: Wonderfully hoppy up front. Hi hops, my name is Brock, i love you....  So yes, hops and i met and started a fantastic relationship. A little caramel behind it. Wonderfully melding scents.  T: Hops again, hard at front and felt throughout the taste but somewhere in the middle gets melded with a wonderful caramel and honey flavor.  M: Goes down nice and oily, like i like um. Wonderfully coats the tongue with just the right amount of carbonation to make it lively as it goes.  D: Loved this one, would like to drink it more often!
NEGATIVE	Pours a golden color, that in no way warns you what you're in for.  Smells like metallic adjuncts, like corn, with some malt in there. Ok, i'm going to stop smelling it now.  The mouthfeel isn't bad, it doesn't taste quite as bad as it smells. Honeyish malt, corn, and a dirty aftertaste.   I can't believe I just bought this.
POSITIVE	Served from tap into a goblet at the Founders event at Duckworth's. Poured a deep dark brown basically black with a minimal tan head. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of roasted malt, bourbon, brown sugar, and molasses. The flavor was of roasted malt, spices, bourbon, and molasses. It had a medium feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this is and always will be quite an excellent brew. This one that we had could use a little age on it to help mellow out the bourbon flavor some as it was quite hot. Still great regardless of this fact with a pretty awesome flavor and nice aroma to go along with it. Glad I got to try this one on tap.
NEGATIVE	A - Poured a reddish-orange body that really glowed...the head was about one finger and white in color...nice retention until it slowly fell to a small ring...decent lacing  S - The first aroma I detect is actually that of sweet malts...the cherry does not come out until the beer settles...the cherries smell sweet and fresh...pretty much like the puree that's described on the label  T - Pretty one dimensional here...cherry flavors are throughout...although the pale malts do add a little bit of depth to the flavor...the cherries are sweet at first but they do present a subtle tartness...it's almost as if there is a slight hop tingle in the finish  M - Medium bodied...has some lightness to it but the cherry puree gives in some body...the tartness doesn't last long...carbonation  This one was kind of different, the cherries are definitely there but theres somehting that is just different for me, if you like cherries you will probably enjoy this
NEGATIVE	nose...copper...nuts...heathery malt....fruity....grassy and vegetal..  mouthed:....  mineraly metallic..hopped...bitter..this is a brave forward one...9.4%...turns hot once it goes down...relatively more complex than most double ipa's out there...  i would drink this again..curious as to its on tap taste...
POSITIVE	Thanks to kmpitz2 for sharing this one. Cool label. It pours a cloudy orange color with a small head that doesn't leave much lacing on the glass. The aroma is comprised of mostly dirty and earthy hops. Small amount of malt in the aroma. The flavor is much the same, but on a more subdued level. A little citrus, a little malt, some hops. Nice balance. Good brew.
POSITIVE	22 oz. Viscous near black pour. Some brown bubbles, sticks to the glass a bit. Big bourbon aroma, accented with molasses, vanilla, caramel, just hints of roast malt. Taste is a real nice balance with the barrel on the stout qualities, not as potent as the nose. Roasted malt, chocolates with light amounts of dark red fruits. Vanilla, caramel, oak follow. Warming, but not as much as the aroma would suggest. Thick and full bodied. Finish is lingering toffee sweetness and oak barrel. The only thing I would say this could use is some more bittering of coffee and hops. I expect barrel aging to negate some of that anyways though. Good drinkability for the "size". A real nice variation on the excellent original Boris.
NEGATIVE	Poured from 25.4 oz bottle into glass. ***Note: It doesn't give the ABV on the bottle, but several websites have it listed as 10% - review is based on that assumption.  From notes:  A- Miniscule head disappears quickly, and we are left with a glowing copper. No carbonation visible.  S- Smells sweeter than many IPA's... a bit llike fruity candy. Light apricot and peach, maybe a bit of tangerine. Very little hop scent here. Not sure what to expect...  T- I'm getting the apricot from the smell, and a hit of booze. You do get a fair amount of hops in the aftertaste, but they feel... Dull. The best way I can think to describe the taste is "flat." Shortly afterwards, the aftertaste is predominately warm alcohol. Considering the ABV, it isn't as boozy as some in this range, but it doesn't mask it terribly well either. I'm all for BBC trying something new and differing from the ultra-hoppy DIPA blueprint, but this one doesn't bring much to the forefront to take their place.  M- Some carbonation may have helped ease this beer's taste. Medium body. Dry finish. Nothing here to help the taste.  O- Allow me to say that I really enjoy the majority of BBC beers. Also, DIPA/IIPA are among my favorite styles... It seemed like a winning bet, but unfortunately this is one was a bit of a disappointment. Not the worst I've had, but I will not be getting this again. This was the first of a series of 25.4 oz BBCs that I bought at my local store... Hoping the other styles are better.
NEGATIVE	Review from notes  Pours copper/auburn with a pinky of cream colored head. Zero head retention & lacing  S: Apricots & leafy hops, persimmons as this warms  T: Much dark fruittyness; figs & apricots, plus breadyness & leafy hops & a touch of butterscotch up front. Figgyness & woody hops dominate as this warms, slight hints of mint as well. Finishes dry, very fruitty with more woody hops; this is not really the sum of it's parts  MF: Light bodied, light carbonation & okay balance  Drinks easy enough, but falls way short of my expectations. This brewery kicks ass with its cask offerings, this bottled offering doesn't come close to measuring up...
POSITIVE	I liked the Double IPA so much that I figured since I saw the 6-pack I'd buy it.  Appearance: Pours a yellow that I wasn't expecting with a quickly dissipating white head. Disappointing as I expected it to at least be hazy and have a bit of head retention.   Smell: Spicy and oily hops up front, some grapfruit and a bit of orange and acidity. Not the best, but pretty decent for the style.  Taste: Hop bitterness up front, some citrus tanginess and bitter grapefruit lingers during aftertaste. The grapefruit flavors are dominant near the end, and I like that spiciness. Though it's not as balanced as I wanted it to be.   Mouthfeel: Light to medium bodied. Medium carbonation. You can sense the bitterness while swishing it around, and this is a good thing.   Drinkability: A solid Pale Ale, but nothing I'd probably buy again. Still, at 5% it would be a trustworthy session beer, especially if you had it with the right foods; since the beer's more toward bitter in the balance department, I'm sure it would go with a lot.
NEGATIVE	22 oz. bottle into a Duvel chalice.  Pours an attractively murky, dark plum hue with a core of chocolate and mahogany. A wispy lace of tightly packed beige bubbles and a ring of foam form, but doesn't offer much to the overall appearance. The aroma offers intricate layers of chocolate and toffee malts with a background laced by raisin, fig, and rum. It comes across more as a Belgian Strong Dark Ale than a Double Ale, but I'm diggin' it, so what the hell.   The flavor is interesting, to say the least. Too many tastes all compete for tastebuds at the same time, making it difficult to sift apart the complex notes of coffee, chocolate, hops, sherry, and prune. The lingering, hoppy bitterness and booze on the finish is a welcome addition, but still both feel a bit out of place amongst the multitude of malty layers. Mouthfeel is thin and surprisingly watery, and could use a boost to its carbonation. Pike Brewing has made an interesting beer with Double Tandem Ale, but unfortunately it misses the mark with too much going on and a wimpy body. I am in no way dreading the second glass, but I can't see myself buying another any time soon.
NEGATIVE	Well... this was pretty wild.. I got to try it at EBF 10 and it just registered to me as unlike anything else.. from the bottle it is still quite unique (not that there is a gradient to how unique something can be..) Very sweet, strong maple syrup character as well as the boozey bourbon aspect. Its pretty heavy.. I can't imagine drinking more than one in one session simply based on the sweetness. it is pretty awesome, though, and with some time on it could be great
POSITIVE	On tap at Kinsale near government center.  Pours a pale orange, almost yellow. No head in the pour, but the body was fairly well-carbonated.  Struggled with detecting aromas as I usually do when drinking at a pub/restaurant- those pub smells really interfere. Still, I was able to get a good sense of this brew. Clean and mellow fall aroma, not overly spiced.  The flavor here is fairly mellow as well, but superb. This has a lager-like crispness that keeps the sweetness from the spices slightly at bay. True pumpkin flavor shines through- it's a rustic fall flavor that is really hard to describe. Really nice finish that's slightly musty.  Again, this brew is so clean and crisp, yet the flavors are robust. The mouthfeel is different from your typical pumpkin ale, yet it suits this brew.  Damn good pumpkin ale. I've tried 6 or 7 pumpkin ales, and this is the first one that has truly agreed with me.
NEGATIVE	Well, shucks. It's kind of a sad event for me when I know ahead of time that I'm going to give a good beer a review that will be lower than the average score. Alas, the average score for this average beer has greatly suffered from grade inflation, I fear.  Pretty? Well. It's dark and opaque. But it doesn't have any head. Sadly, I had a KBS tonight against which I can compare it on a few levels. As for appearance, well, it falls short. It falls short in that it has zero head. Ah. But that's comparing an RIS with a DIS. Oh, excuse me for making the distinction! Well, still, this falls short. No head. Close to "average" for the style but not all that great.  Smells of coffee and dry chocolate. Smoke. Sand dunes after rain.  Tastes interesting. Lots of stuff going on. The only flavor that really sticks out is the chocolate milk. Boy, do I ever have a buddy who would like this stuff! There's a fair amount of smoke and a bit of coffee - but much less than the chocolate. A bit sweet and there's on interesting bitter tang that hits you around the cheeks - kind of a puckery thing. Certainly very interesting for all that is going on. Not a great flavor but something worth trying.  It's about right in the mouth and I suppose I'd drink another if given one but I won't seek it out.
POSITIVE	From bottle to pint glass  A: Blood-orange in color, slightly opaque, little head with little lacing.   S: Nice bouquet of candied orange and caramel. Fresh floral hops abound. Yeasty, kind of biscuit-y. Fairly complex nose, not what I was expecting.  T: More hop-forward than the nose, with the earthy, tea-like hops and the front of the sip. Notes of orange follow, a little lemon zest. The caramelly notes of the malt blend nicely with the rye, almost like sweet, multigrain bread. Alcohol is apparent but just. The hops keep their bitter punch until the end, surprising for this style, finishing bitter-sweet. Really delicious.  M: Medium bodied, with an oily-slick complexion. Not sure if it's the rye character playing tricks on me, but there's a chewiness to the beer that you wouldn't expect from the body.  This beer is outstanding. I got this bottle about 4 or 5 months ago, placed it in the back of my fridge and forgot about it. Its still tastes completely fresh and delicious, all of the flavors blending nicely.
POSITIVE	The first thing you think is "Ethiopian Beer? Yeah Right." But then you try it. First off, this beer has more in common with a Belgian Brown or a Double Bock than a stout, but I assume the word "stout" has come to encompass all darker than average beers in the former colonies. This is quite simply an exceptional beer. It has an excellent mouthfeel and whatever kind of exotic spices are put into this are very noticable, but not in an overbearing way. Has notes of roasted coffee and plums. The bottle with the funky label is also a plus for the collectors in the house.
NEGATIVE	Saw this beer on draft at a local beer bar and couldn't resist. I am not a rauchbier fan and I have tried the other beers from this brewery. I was excited that they made a non-Rauch beer but in hindsight, what exactly was I expecting?  Beer is yellowish and has a slight haze to it. White head and good lacing on the glass.  The aroma of this beer put me off of it almost immediately. It smelled acidic and terrible. Like spoilage. I swirled the beer and smelled it again and this time it was greatly improved. Could pick up on some sweetness and the malt. I'm still penalizing it for the first whiff.  This beer has (SURPRISE!) a slight aftertaste of smoke. Seriously, what did I expect? The brewery responsible for making 5 beers, 4 of them are the world's best Rauchbiers and this one, they couldn't escape it. I wonder if the smoke flavor is intentional or just ingrained in everything they produce. Like they will never be able to make a beer without a slight bit of smoke in it, just because their equipment is coated with it.  Overall the beer was smooth and kind fo bland. The smokey aftertaste was unnecessary and abbreviated my pleasure of this beer. Sorry Schlenkerla. Not interested.
NEGATIVE	Poured from a green bottle into a weizen glass. Has a rich gold color with a 1 inch head. Aroma is mild and slightly sweet. Tasteis so-so. Hoppy and a tad bitter. Feels light and bitter in mouth. Drinkability is average. Overall this is a mediocore beer.
POSITIVE	This is one of the real smoked Bamberg beers. I guess either you love them or you hate them. This one is dark black and has a large brown head, lacing. The aroma is smoked (what else?). The taste is also smoked and has a salty hint. Also some sour toes pops up. This is a beer thats last all night.
NEGATIVE	I poured this in my Duvel glass and the head started off good and retained some small patchy lacing on the glass. The nose was very spicy like fresh cracked pepper with a candied sugar tone on the fade. The taste starts with a bold hop presence that quickly goes to a yeasty dark toasted bread flavor. The second wave of flavor seems to be a dark cherry fruit mixed with a touch of black liquorish. The finish is dry and spicy making your taste buds yearn for more. This would go great with Hot Wings. Cheers....
POSITIVE	A - Poured into a pint glass. Deep orange to red complexion. Slight orange to the head forming up to about a half inch.  S - Hops come across right away. Some fruit notes follow.  T - The hops come through up front as expected. Apricot along with other syrupy fruity notes. Sweet malt flavors as well.  M - Light. Pretty pleasant overall. Good carbonation.  D - If I were more into the taste I could definitely stick with this one all night.  This beer was strikingly similar to Flying Dog's Raging Bitch. I'm not convinced they aren't the same beer actually. That being said, this one is a bit more malty, while The Bitch has a bit more hop to it.
POSITIVE	If you want to get gangsta, and you want to do it in a hurry... just go to the nearest corner store and pick up a 40 oz. bottle of the St. Ides. When you twist off that cap reminiscent of the old one liter botttle soda caps( the metal ones) you will instantly,( well not instantly.) but after you pour a bit on the ground for the homies thats been incarcerated or the g.s that are dead, you will soon come to know the magic that is... St. Ides.  It has the power to turn any average white boy into the hardest thug on the block. soon after you taste the sweet, malty taste, and savor the thick syrup like texture. before you know it your nerdy ungangsta like brain will be thinking about all of the casualties of the streets.  Soon you will be strapping on the doo rags and tagging the name of the hood you were brought up in. Maybe you might even break out the gat. (pellet gun) and start shooting up all of the empty st. ides forties you have laying around.   All in all st. ides is a great way to have alot of fun. on a budget. It tastes fine chilled in the freezer for two hours but drink it fast because it tastes worse and worse the warmer it gets. But if your drinking malt liquor I dont think it really matters. Good times with an exellent malt liquor.
NEGATIVE	Quick notes from Tigris Beverage/g.housen Tasting earlier today. 750mL brown glass bottle with an 11.2oz label affixed to it. Strange. JB said this was an absinthe/wormwood beer.  Appearance is hazy pale straw yellow. Nose is really closed up despite the warmer serving temp. Palate is watery and unappealing. Flavors are faintly citrus-y. Weak and very disappointing.
POSITIVE	12oz into the DFH snifter.  Pour is deep and dark brown, with a rich chocolate head that leaves a mess of lacing across the brew and sides of the glass.  Very strong licorice aroma; some malt at the back but simply overpowered by the licorice.  Full rich flavor. I had this paired with dutch gouda and the flavors balanced nicely, the mouthfeel comes into play a good deal with the thickness of the stout allowing more of the complexity to be revealed as it takes longer for the liquid to clear the palate. Roast, licorice, coffee and malt.  Very thick but not syrupy. Good carbonation. Really spot on mouthfeel.  Aside from the abv being masked in the flavor and the nose by the stong licorice notes this is quite an easy (perhaps too easy) a drink.  (99th)
POSITIVE	This beer is exceedingly bitter, even by DIPA standards. Nonetheless, it tastes quite good (assuming you like bitter) and is very drinkable for a beer with such a high ABV. Recommended.  This beer poured a-not-too-shiny copper red with a good amount of head which quickly faded to a thin lace. Aroma is quite hoppy and sweet...the hops smell almost caramel-y. Flavor is highly bitter and astringent...you taste the bitterness in the front of your tongue, and you feel it in the back of your throat. This beer is quite dry and crisp and masks its 13% ABV quite well. Very drinkable for a DIPA.
POSITIVE	Hoppy, golden/copper color, light, clean, crisp and a very refreshing highly quaffable special bitter. Bags of malt and hops - but perfectly balanced flavors. A cracking session beer with a dry finish. A popular lunchtime beer in the Fernandes Brewery Tap, as drivers can drink 2 pints of this. But don't be fooled by its low strength for this style, it does drink like a Special. One of Fernandes first and still most popular brews.
POSITIVE	A : Pours a black color with a big tan head.   S : Smells with strong oats, coffee, and chocolate aroma  T : Strong bitter coffee flavor, has some chocolate and oats flavor also. Good bitterness and really rich flavor. Excellent balance  M : Really creamy and smooth  D : This is really rich and strong but I could drink multiples of this one
NEGATIVE	Called Original Bhmisch Pils in Germany, they still brew it. 500ml bottle. Mindestens haltbar bis: 23.12.2011.  It pours a very nice deep-gold, straight up Bohemian style. The head is bright and white and leaves some very nice lacing.  The smell is grainy, mellow, and a bit sweet. There is some flowery hops that come in with multiple whiffs.  The flavor is very much textbook Czech pils. It is pretty refreshing actually after having sampled so many German versions lately. It definitely has more of that biscuity buttery presence than a German pils. It also has the noticeable flower and herbal flavors of the Saaz hops.  This isn't the most full-flavored or delicious pilseners I have had, but it is nice having it after a decent drought for czech pilseners.
POSITIVE	Continuing my official tour of Prague for this weekend:  Poured from a bottle into a Guinness pint glass:  A: straw, very clean  S: bright, crisp, clean, very stereotypical Pilsner/Lager, but better...  T: very good, upfront, a little citrus, some bread, overall very strong  M: again, good, crisp and consistent  D: a small confession, this is one of my favorite Pilsners, always good, never a disappointment...
POSITIVE	I am drinking alot of German wheats right now and this was another great one to drink in the summer heat.Nice lemony,and spritzty refresher,light in color.
POSITIVE	Blushing Monk 2011  Served in snifter on tap at Beer Geeks.  A: Appears deep purple with thick, but small plum-colored head. I'm sure this would stain my seersucker suit.  S: All raspberries, mostly sweet but some tartness. Very concentrated. The longer the nose stays in glass, the more natural the raspberries smell.  T: Tastes exactly like it smells. Moves from sweet to tart, concentrated to natural. Little bitterness to counter sweetness, but the tartness fills that role well. A couple sips bring to mind cough syrup. Raspberries linger long into finish. In fact, an hour later I had raspberry burps.  M: Heavy body and lighter carbonation. Mouthfeel is quite sticky and borders on syrupy.  O: Blushing Monk is a great beer for lovers of raspberries, fruit beers, or dessert beers.Very much of a one-note beer, though, and drinkability is suspect, at best.
POSITIVE	Not a huge fan of Pilseners, but I'd heard to much about this one that I figured I'd give it a shot. Pours a light yellow/golden, nice head, pretty nice looking. Nose is solid, surprisinginly strong, hops and sweet malt come through. Taste is smooth, nice balance of hops and malt (especially for a pilsener), some spices as well. Feel is medium bodied, good carbonation. Overall, a every tasty and extremely refreshing beer. If I were feeling like a lager (which occasionally I am), I'd definitely come back to this one.
POSITIVE	I'm a big fan of Yazoo as one of Nashville's few local brews and the only one focusing on brewing rather than brewpubbing, and I'm a big fan of Hefe's. I find the Yazoo Hefe to be an excellent example of the variety. The flavor of cloves dominates in this brew and isn't nearly as citrusy as some other hefe's I've had. The beer finish clean and goes down easy. I have had a few bad Yazoo Hefe's that tasted stale and nearly undrinkable, but I'll chalk those up to bad luck as the majority have been outstanding  The Hefeweizen is now available in bottles, so I'll have to give that a shot and see how it does.
POSITIVE	Finally, the elusive Founders Kentucky Breakfast Stout, well worth the wait.   KBS poured a very, very dark, opaque brown with a half inch darkly tanned head the quickly faded to a slim, but elegant collar.   The aroma was black coffee, rich dark chocolate and, I swear, light peanut butter; in that order.   The taste was... hold on, I expected KBS to be over rated, and I expected to have a home state bias. It wasn't! And, I didn't. It was so good, I had to crack open a second one, and it was warm, no matter. Roasted coffee, chocolate, a hint of vanilla, and yes, oh yes, alcohol. I do want to taste some hot alcohol in my bourbon barrel aged beers, or else why bother. KBS had IT.   Mouth feel was full bodied, oily and perfectly (modestly) carbonated.   Drinkability, this is my second one, I would love another. ABV be damned.   OK, call me a homer, but this is good shit. Make this a year-rounder Founders! On a side note; this makes me want to try another of my cellared Expedition stouts and do a re-rate.
NEGATIVE	900 reviews, whoopee  a: poured into my huge hefe glass, yeast swirled and included, fizzy head dies with a quickness, the beer is a hazy golden-orange in color...the complete lack of head, especially on a hefe, is a big detractor  s: some doughy yeast, sweet lemon, smooth wheat with a pale malt sweetness, a little metallic, a little citric hop twist, pleasant clove and banana  m: bubbly light-medium carbonation and body, a bit fizzy at first but becoming dead over the course  t: yeasy clove with a sugary lemon-wheat sweetness that seems to take over, too sweet, light banana, very light hop flavor and bitterness  d: decent overall, a little heavy and sweet for the style, lowering drinkability  single bottle picked up at a beerfest
POSITIVE	Pours a clear brown color with a decent white head.  Aromas are quite smokey, but not overwhelming. Subtle roasted malt and smokey salmon like notes.  Taste follows the aromas. Nice smokey malt flavors, that aren't too strong. Some sweet creamy malt flavors, and a crisp snappy finish.  Mouthfeel is good. Nice carbonation and an overall smooth character.  Drinkability is good. A nice tasty easy drinking Rauchbier. Reminds me of a mellow little brother to Alaskan Smoked Porter. Nice beer.
POSITIVE	Ah, the simple and complex joys of a wet hopped ale. You never quite know what you are going to get with these.  Pours a golden yellow body and a puffy off-white head that clings incessantly.  Quite simply, the finest aroma I have ever encountered in a beer. The perfect representation of citrusy hops. This is a grapefruit/orange bomb and still maintains some decent lingering grainy background to balance well.  The citrusy hops dominate the taste at the front of the attack, hitting that aggressive acidic bitterness right up front. What is remarkable is the balance in the finish where it turns to a sweetly caramel malt, and the finish, while retaining a good portion of those hop oils, has multiple components pulling through.  The mouthfeel is just fine, even keeled, well carbonated and not too over done. Frothy and thicker for the style.  Genuine hop juice here. An outstanding effort to capture the essence of hops, while having enough malt backbone to stand on its own. Bravo.
NEGATIVE	I can't believe that this stuff made it past the front door of the brewery - its utterly vile.  I'm also appalled that the LCBO would make this a choice as a seasonal beer as it does a huge discredit to other small Ontario brewers and their attempts to establish themselves as making a quality product. I thought that choosing a beer would involve something more than deciding it had a pretty label that would look nice on the shelf.  Pours dark with a short sputtering, soda pop type head. Fierce carbonation and colour make it look pretty much like a cola.  Questionable aroma, very sour to taste. Vague, rough edged hint of maple. Flat out unpleasant and unredeemable.  Trafalgar has never been a real favorite of mine - despite an occasionally credible brew - but this one is a disasterous mistake. For shame!
POSITIVE	Many thanks to BeerTruth for this one.  Pours a rich amber color with a light tan head that fills to the top of the pint glass. Beer is hazy and there's a bit of sediment even though I kept most of it in the bottle. Retention is almost a little chunky and the beer maintains a thin film to the bottom of the glass, with significant stick holding on to the sides.  Smell is very fruity, lots of citrus (grapefruit in particular), as well as some caramal malt and bready aromas. Taste is mostly the same with quite a bit of bitterness, but also more toasted malt flavor than caramel malt sweetness. The bitterness lasts long into the aftertaste. My only complaint is that I'd like a bit more malt sweetness to balance that bitterness, but this is very tasty nonetheless. It's medium-bodied and the hops make it oily and creamy on the palate. Very high quality IPA overall.
NEGATIVE	appearance: deep rich amber, thin head, lots of floaty particulate   nose: sweet, sugar, molasses, honey, orange. some vanilla/oak from the barrel, but not as much as expected. alcohol presence is certainly there.  taste: lots of maple syrup, molasses. sweet. some orange flavors. lots of the alcohol. the sweetness dominates.  mouthfeel: full body, reasonable carbonation.   drinkability: a little too sweet for my tastes.
POSITIVE	Appearance: Pours a clear, dark copper body with a frothy, white head that left bits of splotchy lacing on the way down.  Smell: Toasty pale maltiness with a small hint of caramel. Citrusy, woody, even slightly spicy hops.  Taste: Pale malts, lightly toasty, and with a slight caramel sweetness. Sharp, citrusy hops with a moderate, unyielding bitterness. Finishes crisp and appropriately dry with a long, lingering, but restrained bitterness.  Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. Medium carbonation.  Drinkability: Sure, I'll give it a thumbs up. A very solid, spot-on APA.
NEGATIVE	A - Hazy golden colour with a couple of centimetres of white head that slowly dissipates. Little bit of sporadic lacing. S - Fruity, yeasty esters. T - A bit of a pale malt flavour. Some floral hop presence but quite subdued. M - Low to medium bodied with fairly carbonation. D - Drinkable but fairly boring. Probably wouldn't bother getting again.
NEGATIVE	A loyal BMC drinker friend gave me one of these and told me how great it is so I'm wondering what all the fuss is about.  12oz bottle poured into weizen glass no freshness date, says "Malt Beverage with Natural Flavor" on the bottom of the bottle. Uh-oh? Sort of makes me think of Smirnoff Ice all malt beverage, we shall see I guess.  A: Pours a cloudy peach (ha!) color, looks a lot like a blue moon and other beers of that sort. Head is about an inch but fades away too quickly and forms a smallish ring around the glass. For shame.  S: Mmm, very inviting sweet peach and apricot, not too far removed from the Apricot Weizen the Pyramid puts out with a little yeasty backend which sort of lets you know it's a beer and not a malt beverage (even though it says so on the label).  T/MF: A bit bitter for a beer that claims to taste like a peach. I am inclined to believe that the brewer just jacked a truck of Apricot Weizen and relabled it. A bit flat on the peach side with the yeast doing most of the work as the peach/ apricot brings up the rear. Finished with a funky cooked buttery popcorn flavor with a bit of a warm alcohol finish, strange.  D: Refreshing but not really that great from a hardcore beer drinker standpoint. It's a nice change if you're BMC drinker but I'd take a Blue Moon or Apricot Weizen over this.
NEGATIVE	A - Slightly murky very dark brown color. Almost opaque. Short lived, tan head that quickly dissipates into a thin ring.  S - Deep dark malts, raisins, chocolate, oaky vanilla, roasty and a little earthy. Boozy alcohol is only a tiny bit distracting.  F/M - Caramel, dark roasty malts, cocoa and bitter baker's chocolate. Moderately high hop bitterness, accentuated by roastiness. Warm boozy alcohol is rather pleasant (better than the aroma suggests). Medium full bodied with moderately low carbonation. Chocolaty vanilla aftertaste.  D - Boozy and big. Very assertive. A sipper for sure, but not much more than a full glass. The second half of this bomber is gonna have to wait until tomorrow.
POSITIVE	Into oversized wine glass.  Pours a deep cloudy amber with a nice off white head that fades to to a pleasant lacing.  Aroma is of floral hops, strong pine, and a mild malt backbone.  Taste is of floral, grassy, a little sweet malt, sticky hops, and mildly bitter.  Mouthfeel is medium and well carbonated.  Overall is a good beer. I would buy again if I were in Wisconsin.
NEGATIVE	pours as your typical stout does with slightly more head. Black liquid, tan foam.   I was taken aback by the heavy brown sugar character that overpowers chocolate and bourbon. Some dark fruit there also.   This one is pretty light on the bourbon and unfortunately there aren't many other robust characteristics to back this up. Vanilla and dark fruits are here.   Mouth is med thick bodied and med carbonation. A bit too much carbonation.   I wouldn't have this one again. While it is an easily available ba stout, it's worth the extra effort to get a kbs.
NEGATIVE	Had this on-tap at Local Option. Served in a Bell's tulip.  A - Poured with two fingers of creamy white foam that had excellent retention, but only a few spots of lace. The color was lighter than I expected from a smoked doppelbock, and was almost a transparent dark golden when held up to the light. Still it was quite attractive.  S - The name doesn't lie. Smoke. Oak. Very meaty, with tons of hickory and implied bacon. This is a little more intense than the fastenbier and I miss the offsetting malt sweetness that helps to balance things out.  T - The taste is more in line with what I was hoping for, with some nice caramel malt character supporting the big smoky meat and wood flavors. There's a bitter, tannic finish that jibes with the oak flavor, and an aftertaste of smokiness and lightly glazed ham.  M - Medium body, moderate carbonation, somewhat sticky. There's a definite residual feel of smokiness - not surprising I guess.  D - I don't like this as much as the Fastenbier, but it's better than the Urbock. In general there's just too much smoke and not enough balance. Glad I got to try it once, but not something I feel the need to have again. If you dig rauchbier, this is definitely a must-try, but I doubt you needed my endorsement to know that.
POSITIVE	Had this on draught at Ashley's in Ann Arbor. I was pleasantly surprised to see this one on tap again aside from a fest or the brewery.  A-Pours very similar to a stout in color. A very dark opaque black with some very subtle mahagony hues that come through when held into the light. 1/4 inch creamy beige head that recedes almost immediately into spotted lacing.  S-Wonderful nose that took me a while to get past before indulging into my first sip. Lots of vanilla beans, creme brule, maple, chocolate roasted malts, sweet malts, caramel, bourbon, and a little booze.  T-Stays pretty consistant with the smell. Starts off with sweet vanilla, caramel, toasted biscuits, and maple flavors. Picked up on some toffee flavor as well. very smooth and creamy. Mild hops, bourbon and oak in the finish that keeps all the sweets in check.  M-Silky smooth, milk like mouthfeel. Very creamy. Mild hops in the finish.   D-Black biscuit goes down wayyy to easy for the 10%ABV. I had a hard time setting my glass down between drinks. I hope they bottle this one day so it can find it's way into my collection.
POSITIVE	Appearance- On draft, into a 12 oz flute. Pours a clear golden yellow color with a creamy bone white 2 finger head. Good head retention and lacing left behind.  Smell- Hops dominate the aroma, Pine that is slightly resinous, and lots and lots of citrus fruits.  Taste- The citrus flavors hit you first, pineapple and grapefruit notes. Under that is some earthy resinous pine, with some floral notes as well. A light caramel like malt backbone as well. Hop forward, but the finish is lingering bitter fruit, not just a bitter dryness.  Moutfeel- Creamy, medium body and carbonation. A slight alcohol warming, but no fusel alcohol is noticed.  Overall- They don't call this Double Trouble for nothing, very drinkable for 9.4%.
NEGATIVE	Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a tulip glass. 2010 vintage  A: Hazy, medium amber color with a patchy residue of fairly large off-white bubbles. lacing remains on the glass and solids hang suspended throughout the column.  S: Bready, with a fairly aggressive level of toast to it. Lesser fruit occupies the middle range of color, suggesting dates, while new aromatic wood is also suggested. No alcohol is detected.  T: Begins sweet, with refined caramel and pale malt, immediately spirituous, and early herbaceous bitterness. Acidity, though soft, is transmitted rather boldly in the taste, probably encouraging fruit flavors to develop more rapidly than they otherwise might. Heavy yeast esters do carry with them the perception of cooked fruit in the middle, resulting in a fairly deep variety to what initially appeared to be clean and straightforward on the palate. Bitterness is moderate in the drying finish, where aromatic flavors of musty wood, earth, brandy, and resurgent but huskier grain all become very interesting.  M: Moderate to thick viscosity, initially astringent on the palate which clashes with the overall syrupy decadence, with low carbonation.  D/O: Really more interesting than good, this old ale seems to ooze authenticity. While no part of it qualifies as offensive, there is a discordant note than is struck early on in the taste by a precocious bitterness that is awkwardly fresh in its plant-like way. Then on its heels is a similarly lively acidity; taken together, these two elements have the effect of splitting the flavor profile into asymmetrical halves. Deeper on things seem to normalize, with a remarkable complexity coming on by the finish.
POSITIVE	On tap at the Blue Dog in Lansdale- served in a Tulip glass.  Amazing looking stout- black as tar but the head was more dark brown/greyish than tan; a very dark but rich looking combination. Head was foamy- slowly reduced to sticky lace that caused lip-licking after every sip.  Aroma had hints of cocoa, bittersweet (dry) chocolate, slight malt. Taste was the same, but it had an amazingly rich/dry/full flair that stood out as different (but very excellent) from the Guinness-like Stout that I sampled prior to this brew. The contrast was amazing.  Full mouth feel- nice and bubbly- found myself noting a "wow" after every sip, as the taste and feel combination is very well paired.  Very drinkable and also would probably age very nicely.
POSITIVE	This is a local beer for me, so I've been fortunate enough to be able to sample it from a bottle, and most recently from a 1/6 barrel that is in my kegerator at home right now. I picked it up on June 12, it's born on date is June 6th.  When I first had this out of a bottle, I wasn't very impressed compared to other IPA's, but for the price, it does find it's way into my refrigerator now and then.   Pours with a decent head and leaves some lacing on the glass  S: much better from the tap vs bottle. I get the smell of hops I expect from an IPA right away out of the tap version. Not so much from the bottle, and I am using the exact same snifter.  T: taste the hops in the first few mouthfulls  D: I had 3 last night, the last as good as the first.
NEGATIVE	This is a very good beer, but the chocolate is a bit too much for me, so it loses points there... especially when I compare it to the IS from Founders. pours a dark oily molases small dark brown head.  strong smell of chocolate and coffee, perhaps some nuts  taste is pretty much the same, with the chocolate leading the taste, my one problem with it ( it is good, but a bit too much chocolate for me, i know it specifically says it on the bottle, but yeah...)  very drinkable, smooth
POSITIVE	A: opaque black and medium tan head and virtually no lacing on tap  S: coffee, bitter chocolate, oatmeal, some caramel  T: no caramel here, awesome show of oatmeal, chocolate, coffee. Very true to the breakfast style. Not a great beer for a sampling, only because the flavor is so progressive, that it stays with you for an extended period and difficult to refresh your pallet, not that you'd want to  M: sticky on-tap, very small warmth from alcohol  O: best regular drinking beer i've had.
NEGATIVE	Label describes this as an ''Ale rousse multiculturelle'' I don't think I need to translate. 341ml bottle.  A-Looks quite fizzy and seltzery. Head gone in about ten seconds. Amber liquid is full of bubbles. S- Some sour fruit a bit like a berry cocktail. Caramel, woodiness and bland yeast.   T- Much like the smell this is a bt like juice. Woody and malty finish. A little boiled vegetable.  M- Thin with low carbonation although it might feel like that because I lifted the bottle high, unsuccesfully trying to build a head   D- Easy to drink like juice but uninteresting so I don't want another sip.   I often felt like buying this because of the novelty of the label but always passed because my basket was already full. I will never buy it again.
NEGATIVE	Presentation: 12oz green bottle, 4.4%ABV, Expiring in 4 months.  Appearance: Dark morning piss yellow (sorry, if it sounds vulgar...). I would probably describe it as brownish/reddish yellow with amber copper reflets. Good head of white foam when pour. It didn't lasts for a very long time.  Smell: Skunk alert! Damn, it was awful when I uncapped my bottle.  Taste: Bitter. It got taste, but I don't really like it. Tastes too much like the smell.  Mouthfeel: Very common. Not much to say here.   Drinkability: I don't know if I was unlucky, but the beer seems overated. Skunkness seems too usual with the "high-class" product. I already miss my Eggenberg (reviewed during the same current session.)
POSITIVE	Really psyched to start seeing this more often in MA. Pours black with a nice chocolately head. Lots of delicious roasted malts going on from start to finish. The taste is nicely balanced and hides the sneaky ABV pretty well. A really solid and tasty porter, definitely going to be a go to beer this fall and winter.
POSITIVE	On-tap at the brewpub. Above average IPA, with some dry hopping. Grapefruit colour, a solid white head and lacing, with good carbonation and above-average bitterness. C-hop aroma. A good drinker. Active carbonation fortunately does not detract from creamy mouthfeel.
POSITIVE	Most people enjoy Blondes and Hefe's in the summer... I prefer IPAs... Appearance is quite good, lighter yellow in color. Some head and lacing- nice oily look that I love. Smell is decent- citrusy and piney with a healthy dose of floral hops. Taste- its not the hoppiest IPA but very good. Similar to the smell but stronger and a bit of malt balances this one out. The alcohol is hidden very well. Mouthfeel is nicely carbonated with a warm velvety feel. Drinkability is amazing.
POSITIVE	Poured from a bottle into a Sam Adams Perfect Pint Glass...  Appearance: Pours a nice amber color with some decent bubbles from the carbonation, about a half inch of bubbly head that fades pretty quickly leaving behind a bit of sporadic lacing.  Smell: Not much here (though I admit I am a bit congested)...a bit of subdued sweetness with not much else.  Taste: Picks up a bit from the smell, crisp with a nice biscuity sweetness. Refreshing.  Mouthfeel: Good carbonation leaves a bit of tingle on the palate. Easy drinking, goes down smooth.  Drinkability: Not a bad Marzen. Stoudts produces some quality, easy drinking brews and this one does not disappoint. I've had better Marzens, but this one is good and I would reach for it again.
NEGATIVE	I think I was saving this for a special occasion, but what's more special than the first day to break 60 degrees in 3 months? Cheers to better weather - here's my review on a bottle poured into a tulip.   Appearance: Beautiful opaque black with only a hint of brown. Skim of a caramel tan head that hangs around the edges and leaves the lightest lacing behind.   Smell: The smell is actually somewhat subtle, with hints of bitter coffee, syrupy caramel malts, slight chocolate and pungent alcohol.  Taste/Mouthfeel: The taste is very complex. I get different characteristics of the beer with each mouthful. Pronounced bitter coffee and roasted, syrupy, but not too sweet malts dominate and are met with a bitter, oily hoppiness. The alcohol is very present, especially in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is very rich with moderate and satisfying carbonation.  Drinkability: Moderate - the heat from the alcohol is pleasing, but the bite slows me down a bit.   Interesting offering from Founders, and I'm glad I got to try it. Definitely defined and different from the FBS, and holds its own well.
POSITIVE	This nice brew pours into a deep amber-brown color with a decent foamy head. The aroma is light and yeasty with just a hint of sharpness. The flavor is light and has obvious berry-like undertones. Clean and refreshing with hints of chocolate, this is worth a try. The body is not overly carbonated and the brew goes down smoothly.
POSITIVE	Now Quaffing: Founder's Breakfast Stout  12:07... AM... perfect time for my first Breakfast Stout. This beer pours just about as close to black as it can. ZERO light visible, in fact, light seems to be sucked into this magical elixir of darkness. The deep mocha head almost erupts over the edge of the glass on an aggressive pour. Lacing is fine and plasters the side of the glass as the opaque tide recedes. Initial rush of cappucino as I stole a whiff from the bottle. Once poured, the aromas where much more subdued--coffee with sweet chocolate. The taste is fairly sweet with a good blend of the milk chocolate and coffee. A slight bitterness lingers, similar to after drinking coffee. The mouthfeel is both creamy smooth and subtley crisp. Drinkability is very good with almost no evidence of the alcohol in the taste. This would make a nice pair with a big greasy breakfast... mmm bacon..
NEGATIVE	Way too sweet.  I am really starting to believe that America is the beer capital of the world. We didnt invent it, we just perfected it! I had high hopes for this beer but it stuck in my mouth and took several glasses of water to thin in out!  wont try again  Alcohol well hidden by the overpowering sweetness  Color was good but for my American palate this beer fell way short
NEGATIVE	Aroma: Citrus fruit, mangos, grapefruit, a hint of pine.  Appearance: Pours short one finger off-white head, dissipates quickly. Some lacing. Orangish amber color. A lot of particles floating in it, my fault didn't realize it was bottle-conditioned.  Flavor: A lot of grapefruit up front. Spiciness comes in as a secondary flavor. Earthy notes, especially in the aftertaste. Very high bitterness. Somewhat astringent.  Mouthfeel: Very dry. Medium low mouthfeel. Alcohol evident.  Overall: Not bad, but not feeling it. Too much bitterness and high astringency for my tastes.
POSITIVE	Smooth Hoperator - On Tap.  Appearance: Pours a deep amber with an off white head and a good bit of lacing.  Smell: Floral hops providing a flowery aroma, just a hint of bready malt sweetness.  Taste: Hops. Bitter, slight citrus, slight pine. There is some caramel/roasted malt action but this beer is more about the hops than anything. It lives up to the name.  Mouthfeel: Medium to full bodied.  Drinkability: Clocking in at 7% ABV, this beer still remains dangerously sessionable, if you don't mind getting a solid buzz after three or four. I was slightly disappointed that there wasn't more Doppelbock character to it. Though its a lager, it tastes more like an IPA.
NEGATIVE	Clear very golden color. smells decent I did detect a little skunk but oh well. The flovor is strong but very pleasent sweetness and bitter meld together in an enjoyable combination. I enjoyed this brew. Got the tall boy 1pt. 6.3 oz bottle and I wish I would have got the sixer. Very good Pislner worth the money you pay for it. All pilsners should wish to be this good, and we all know that there is a mess load of crappy ones. Yummy!!
POSITIVE	A: Deep maroon with very active carbonation. Fine particulates can be seen when the beer is held up to the light. Lumpy tan head has nice retention. Leaves spots of lace and a slight ash-like residue.  S: Smoky, but not so much so as their Marzen. In this beer, the smoke is well balanced with molasses and caramel aromas. There is a slight pepper tingle in the background.  T: Well balanced. Smoke isn't over the top. Instead, it complements the flavors of molasses and toffee to create a nice harmony. Because of the smoke, the hops don't need to do too much to offset the beer's sweetness. Nonetheless, they provide a mild pepper presence that adds an extra layer of complexity. Finishes with a linger smoke flavor that lasts well into the night.  M: Medium body feels a little under carbonated.  D: Perfect with smoked sausage. The lighter smoke flavor makes this beer a bit easier to take all alone. But it still goes best with smoked meats and heavy cheeses. A very nice beer.
NEGATIVE	From the OCB discovery pack no. 2. 341ml bottle poured into a mug.  A - Poured a dark brown with a hint of red. No head. Not much carbonation either. Looks like cola that's gone flat.  S - Toasts and malts with a hint of coffee.  T - Caramel malts, burnt toasts, coffee, and hop bitterness at the end.  M - Flat. Minimal tingling of bubbles on the tongue. Smooth, bordering on watery. It's not doing it for me here.  D - Flat burnt coffee. One is enough for me.
NEGATIVE	Notes from web site: "Back Yard" is a golden India Pale Ale. Historically, ale shipped to India in the 19th Century was brewed to higher gravities so that it could mature during the long sea voyage. English brewers also hopped these ales heavily to protect them from spoiling. The term "India pale Ale" or "I.P.A." is still used by brewers to denote a super-premium, hoppy pale ale style. Backyard IPA is no exception. English pale barley malt is predominant in this beer with just a small amount of crystal malt. It is well bittered with Cluster and Cascade hops and finished with a mix of local hop and larger amounts of Fuggle hop. Original Gravity 1.060 / Final Gravity 1.013 / 6.1% abv. Served at the Brewery.  A Golden brown, one inch head. Sort of basic  S Very hoppy. Bitterness also.  T Hoppy continued into the taste. I do not like this much bitterness. I did not want this in my mouth for very long.  M Could have been light to moderate but the hoppy bitterness makes this mouthfeel heavy to me.  D Not good. It is true that I do not like the hoppiest of beers but (as mentioned) I did not want this in my mouth.  Notes: Hop heads may really appreciated this.
NEGATIVE	Big and dark brown, with a milk chocolate head, this thing checks in a little heavier than most, at 6.5 percent ABV. There's a full rounded mouthfeel and excellent head retention, indicating a nice protein body, with a generous and completely balanced hop finish.  Although not as well known as many of their offerings, this is an above average porter, an excellent winter warmer, and one well worth seeking out.
POSITIVE	12 oz. bottle, purchased from a reputable distributer 7/2011, well stored.  Poured into a Dogfish Head Snifter.  Poured rather aggressively into the glass produces very little head which rapidly reduces to a thin film.  The smell starts off with a blast of distinct French Roast black coffee, followed by heavily roasted malt, some hints of dark caramel, rather powerful, lasts from the first opening to the end.  The taste is dominated by distinct, aggressive, black roasted malt, and black coffee, some elusive hop flavors, crisp acidity adds balance, wonderful carbonation that is not overdone and compliments this brew. Seems to be at its best at about 55 degrees.   Very long finish of coffee and deep roasted malt, coats the mouth.  I have to say that Porters are not one of my favorite styles of beer. That being said, I will say that while there is nothing overly complex here, it is a very distinctly flavored brew and you have to admire what Founders is doing.  Founders never seems to fail in producing black beers, and this is no exception. It is unquestionably the best Porter I have ever tasted. A pleasant experience and one that I appreciate the opportunity to have had.
POSITIVE	Huge thanx to Bstaffor for this, one of the best out of his package so far!!  A:Pours a almost black color with a tan head that slowly falls leaving nice lacing hanging around     S:Big smokey roasted malts up front make way for a light caramel and chocolate take  over of the nose, but then smokey senses start to take over again     T:Holy awesomeness, this was not what I was expecting. Roasted malts come up first to make way for a big explosion of smokey bacon flavor that lingers around that backend and dominates the palate     M:Decent mouthfeel to this with ample body as well. Palate is pretty much covered by the smokey bacon flavor that this brew is dominated by     D:Very easy drink on this and I had no idea it was 9% till I looked at the bottle the next morning, ended up being totally not what I expected it to be but in a good way. What was that? You enjoy bacon, then get this brew. Its all I could keep saying when I was drinking it.
POSITIVE	Got a couple of these in various trades.  As I start to pour it I am shocked at how black it is. One if the darkest brews I have seen. No head at all so I pour slightly harder and still nothing.  Smell is amazing. Straight strong burbon and bitter chocolate with alot of charred wood. It smells amazing.  Wow. Awesome taste. Tastes just as it smells. The oak woody flavour is strong with the chocolate and burbon as well. Some vanilla notes as well. You can barely taste the alcohol but after a few sips it warms you chest up alot.  Mouthfeel is great. Smooth and crisp at the end with the wood dominating.  This beer is intense and I can finish a whole one for sure but another right after? I think not...
POSITIVE	Pours jet black with thick, foamy head.  Scents of milk chocolate & coffee.  Strong coffee, milk chocolate with bitter chocolate finish.  Nice but a little thin for a stout.  The more of this I drink, the better I like it. It is not overpowering like the Abyss, but very well balanced and extremely drinkable! Very hard to pick out individual elements, which again adds to the nice balance. If not for the 9.5%, I could drink this all night.
POSITIVE	Appearance - small disappating head, golden color, quite clear, barely any carbonation activity. I've had this quite a bit before, but if I were to pretend I haven't, and try to guage this beer on appearance alone, it would seem that it does not have much to offer.  Smell - Medium strength smell comprised of hoppy and maybe a touch of roasted/caramel malty aromas. Most of the other competitive pilseners I've had have an overwhelming hoppiness in the nose, which is good in one sense but not very special. I like the smell which has more than just hops to offer.  Taste - I like how this is not a one trick pony. You don't get slammed just by the hop flavor. This is much better balanced than most pilseners I've had, offering more malty tones that complement the hop character and medium bitterness. If I were to compare this to a hypothetical 'ideal pilsener' in opinion, this would come closer than a lot of craft or specialty pilseners on the market.  Mouthfeel - More bite from the carbonation than the appearance leads one to believe. Finishes clean leaving a mild bitterness in the mouth. Refreshing overall.  Drinkability - Overall I can see myself drinking a lot more of these than craft pilseners. If we agree that this is the original, then I feel that craft pilseners or other pilsener attempts have really strayed away from the point. This one is really well balanced. Can it be improved upon? Sure, but for such a widely distributed beer the balance is really excellent and it offers more than the sum of its parts.
POSITIVE	Based on the notes, this is a 2004 or earlier version. There was no date on the bottle or the 4 pakc carrier.  This pours a very dark and viscous black with a dense one finger head, that might be the darkest I've seen. It took forever for the foam to fade to a very nice cap, leaving behind a solid sheet of lace.   Smell; very good roasted malt aromas, with a solid presence of chocolate. There's some dark fruits, with coffee and caramel.   Taste; the roasted malts dominate the first few sips with te coffee and slightly over cooked caramel. After I let this sit for a while some very nice dark fruits come through with dates, prunes and raisins. To top it all off this finishes with a rich dark chocolate flavor.  Mouthfeel/Drinkability; this has a very full bodied mouthfeel, and I'm not surprised after the pour. Drinkability is very good, especially since the alcohol is barely detectable, but it's still a sipper for sure.  I've passed this beer up in the past, for reasons I can't explain. Never again though. Founders is definitely one of my top two or three favorite breweries.
NEGATIVE	A-Nice deep copper color, thin head, some lacing.  S-Wonderful malty and earthy nose  T-Rather sweet with some background bitterness. Smooth, roasty and malty.  M-Very smooth, viscous, slight carbonation bite at the side of the tongue.  D-Goes down easy, but at 6.5% you get some bang for your buck
POSITIVE	Cambridge Brewing Company Weekapaug Gruit Ale  Tap into Stemmed Tulip  Slightly hazy deep amber wih a smallish off white head--swirl brings it around but not much.  That wild rosemary dominates the aroma, in a good way. The herbal tea-like quality of this beer is refreshing. Some caramel maltiness shines through.  Again, the rosemary dominates at first but as it warms earthy qualities begin to appear, there is a vegetal quality to the flavor that is not unlike beer brewed with sweet potatoes--this is not an unpleasant vegetal flavor but very complimentary to the herbs used in flavoring. Smooth-ish finish.  I was more than excited to try this beer--the herbal flavors meld very well with the malt used--perhaps towards the end of the glass I found the flavors a bit too aggressive, but perhaps paired with a meal, not so much. Fun beer to drink.
POSITIVE	12 Oz bottle Sampled through the efforts of Boxing Day BIF and Pentathlete.  Pours a deeply red colored ale with a tan head. The shade here is so dark that I could almost call this reddish brown.  The smell is quite hoppy and aromatic. There is a base slightly sour scent of rye here that is complimented by the hops. Hop aromas are anchored by a basic oak aroma with citrus and pine on top with a spicy edge.  Taste is dry and woody at the beginning. Malt and hop flavors kick in here at about the same time. There is a faint sour twang here with mostly woody hops as the main flavor. Strongly flavored but mellow too. Malt flavor stays restricted to dark sugar and a bit of caramel flavor.  Mouthfeel is good.  A very drinkable beer for those who like them dry and hoppy. Nothing at all is bad about this beer, the only thing that would prevent sessioning all night is the above 5% alcohol level. A very mellow beer I can recommend.
NEGATIVE	12 fl oz brown bottle, served in a snifter.  Hazy, glowing peach in color beneath a foamy white head with good retention. Ringed and thin lacing with great strength.  Oily hop resin highlighted by bright tropical fruit: pineapple, peach, honeydew. Bready with a touch of diacetyl. The alcohol presence is a bit heavy and reminiscent of rum.   Aggressive, gritty pine with tones of melon and peach. As intense as the hop character is, it is nicely 'balanced' by a darker, biscuit-like malt base. The spiciness of the hops are relentless from beginning to end and create a dark, full bitterness. The tropical fruit return in the aftertaste.  Full bodied; certainly not a 'light', citrus or fruit-driven IPA. This one is full and rough around the edges.   Full flavored and full bodied doesn't really make this IPA sessionable. A good offering, just not my favorite version of the style.
POSITIVE	The blackest stout I have ever seen. Thin cream tan head that leaves good lacing on the glass.  Smells of strongly of chocolate and coffee.  You taste a strong coffee taste up front then it transition to a strong chocolate taste that finishes with a slight bitterness. Complex!  A creamy full bodied delight to your mouth.  Yummy! Delisous! Great! What else can I say! Try it!
POSITIVE	This was the second time I had had the KBS, both times on tap. The first time was the Extreme Beer Fest, so I could appreciate it more this time. I had remembered it being sweeter the first time but more chocolatey this time. At any rate, I was much more impressed this time. It was served in a goblet at the brewpub.  A: Jet black body with no head. Even when held to the candle at the table, no light penetrated.  S: The smells emanating from the glass were very strong and delicious. Right up front was a ton of chocolate followed by coffee, dark fruits (dates?), some smokiness and a bit of maple syrup. All in all, it kind of smelled like a burnt mocha, but in a good way if that's possible.  T: The taste is just like the aroma, very chocolaty with coffee and some burnt sugar flavors. The smoothness and creaminess are incredible for a beer of 10% alcohol. This is definitely one of my favorite beers, although I am partial to double stouts.  M: As I said before, the creaminess and smoothness are amazing although the beer is lighter in body than it would seem. Many of these high alcohol double stouts have the same quality of only medium body.  D: I wish I lived in Grand Rapids. Enough said.
NEGATIVE	Pours a clear tea color with a most but very creamy off-white head. The smell consists of a musty smoke aroma with smooth malt tones as well. The taste is malty with a smokey overtone and very light hops and again the musty presence with a medicinal end to each swallow. The carb bite in this beer with the flavors seems somewhat electrified with a nine-volt batter that zaps the tongue. This is a light bodied beer that finishes smokey dry.  Notes: It has alot going for it but one thing that really is out of whack is the ultra thin mouthfeel. Still fairly drinkable, but it comes up short of a great beer.
POSITIVE	Big thanks to ClevoPiwo for the hook up.  Pours near black with a silky mocha head.  Nose has rich chocolate, dark malts, roasted coffee, molasses, oak, bourbon, vanilla, subtle hops and dark fruity alcohol notes.  Taste is also hugely complex. Cocoa, espresso, whiskey, vanilla, toffee, wood and peppery alcohol with bitter hops in the finish.  Big, silky body is delicately carbonated. Great beer from Hoppin' Frog.
POSITIVE	This stout is not as sweet as I thought it would be. Smells great like a sweet coffee-like mocha. Pours dark dark brown, almost black. No light gets through. Very burnt coffee like taste. chocolately stout also... very basic. But still good. Leaves a good lacing, and very interesting mocha aftertatse that sticks around for a while... Definitely worth a try, but I wouldn't pay $16 for it again.
POSITIVE	The premise: Pike blends their XXX Extra Stout with an imperial stout aged in bourbon barrels for seven months. First released in '08, Entire is promoted as an annual high-profile specialty beer  la Abyss.   Entire is impenetrably black with a smooth body and peripheral suds. The aroma boasts bitter chocolate and oaked sherry but with a noticeable measure of alcohol and some wayward medicinals. Bourbon elements are contributory but not decisive. They lend a hint of oak character to an otherwise fine standalone stout flush with roast barley and ample hop spice.   An easy sipper, aged to a regal informality, though a tad less than spectacular.  Note: I keep listing Pike's Extra Stout with 5 "X"s and the database keeps posting it with just 3. Weird.
POSITIVE	Appearance - Murky amber color with a fluffy off-white head.  Aroma - Very light fresh herbal aroma with some mild notes of pine resin.  Mouthfeel - Medium bodied brew with small bubble carbonation.  Taste - Initially the brew has a Tonic water like taste, but then builds to a strong grapefruit middle. It finishes with a slight metallic aftertaste.  Overall - Very refreshing brew. This would be a good one with barbeque. There is a slight metallic aftertaste in the finish but its not overly offensive.
POSITIVE	From 5/22/10 notes. Poured from a 22 oz. bottle into a pint glass.  a - Pours a dark brown with 2 inches of brown head and light carbonation,   s - Smells of chocolate, coffee, roasted malts, and vanilla. Very nice balance.  t - Tastes of roasted malts, coffee, bitter hops, and hints of alcohol.  m - Medium to full body and low carbonation. Very smooth and creamy.  d - A very nice RIS. I thought the smell was great and taste was quite enjoyable as well. Would definitely have again.
NEGATIVE	This beer is made with buckwheat. Dark red, mahogany. White foam, scarce, average in compactenss, not persistent. Fruity prevails in the smell (peach, apricot), and floral (white flowers); quite sweet. It may seems strange, but you can feel some smoke-ash smell. In the taste rises up the grains, the sweet fruitness (ripe apple, peach), and there is again that note of smoke-ash. Even some light hop bitterness note. Essentialy sweet, from fuit. Creme caramel? Medium-light in body, sweet malty and caramel in he aftertaste. But it left almost nothing. Some solvent note in the nose in the finish
POSITIVE	Review #200, poured into a snifter and left to warm for a few minutes.  A - Pours a cloudy orange-amber with no head. Very still, looks more like a liquor then a beer. S - HUGE initial Bourbon aromas with sweet amber malt, maple syrup, and candied orange peel. I'm detecting a slight note of roasted banana or plantains, I assume this is from the wheat. Smells boozy, but delicious! T - I can't really shake the roasted plantain flavor, the base of the beer tastes very similar to a big Dunkelweizen. Again, TONS of bourbon, a good amount of sweet maple syrup, vanilla from the oak, and more candied orange peel. I think the best way to describe this would be a roasted banana, soaked in bourbon, then dipped in maple syrup. Noms. M - Thick and syrupy with low carbonation and a noticeable, but not unpleasant, alcohol "burn". D - Well, you certainly aren't going to chug a bunch of these in a night. This is a perfect after-dinner drink, or cold-weather nightcap. Oh, and if you don't like Bourbon you should probably avoid this one.
POSITIVE	Thanks to waltonc for sharing this one.  A: Thick motor oil pour with big dark brown head. Classic looking imperial stout  S: Coffee, roasted malt, sugary toffee. Just a beautiful aroma, you can tell this is going to be a good one  T/M: Damn good stuff. Russian Imperial Stout flavors of coffee, roasted malt and toffee are very well balanced. Thick, full-bodied.  D: Would love to drink this more often but that would mean moving to Ohio  A fantastic beer. Up there with the other great RIS I've had the fortune to try, like Stone & Santa's Little Helper
NEGATIVE	Appearance  Pours a deep reddish amber that is extremely cloudy. A finger think head arises that is a very light tan color and slightly frothy. Tons of nice lacing is left on my glass as the beer downs.   Smell  Extremely strong of citrus up front with orange standing out and lemon following. Some malt such as toffee malt can be detected underneath but its just dominated by hops. Pine and floral aromas are there from the hops and its bitter smelling.  Taste  Up front its very citrusy and strong of orange. The flavor then goes malty where I taste toffee and brown sugar flavors. It finishes floral with a huge alcohol kick. There is even a slight whiskey taste in there as well.   Mouthfeel  Evenly carbonated with a substantial body. A little oily as well.   Drinkability  Not bad here. Its alcohol kick makes it difficult at times. A sipper for sure.   Thanks to demcorhip once more for the great beer. This one was extreme.
NEGATIVE	This is similar to, but less pleasant and enjoyable than, the same brewer's Before-After. I do not understanbd why this is listed as a Belgian Dark Ale as this seems like a doppelbock or maybe maibock or strong lager of some sort.   Amber-copper, it has a medium tan head soon shrinking to a few bubbles, not very good and in fact rather ugly.  Aroma is strong fermented grain, wet rusty metal, old raisins. It is very strongly malty-sweet, simple, and not pleasant at all. In fact, it smells quite bad to me.  Taste is much better but not enough to save it. It is spicey-sweet fruit juice, raisin, a hint of toast and cheap brandy. It is lightly sweet with hint of faint spicey bitterness underneath. It is simple but tastes reasonably good but in the end is mostly fermented, alcoholic fruit juice and fails to maintain any interest in the face of the off-putting aroma. It is also very heavy for what you get. Drinkability thus fades fast.
POSITIVE	This beer pours a hazy gold. Has the typical head that one would expect from a Helles, and it left tracing down the glass. The beer had a midly malty flavor, though not overpowering and not cloying. There was a hint of hops, but not much more. Overall, a fine example of a Munich helles. Try one and enjoy.
POSITIVE	You know, you really can't ever go wrong with Founders. I'm really glad to live in an area that gets such solid distribution of their amazing beers. The review is from notes taken on 6/25/2010 and poured from the growler to a pint glass. Split with beerman207 and a couple other folks who were present for the awesomeness of this beer.  Appearance: Pour is a solid coppery color and starts with a 1 and 1/2 finger off-white head that fades to a thin and uneven skim; body is very clear and shows moderately strong carbonation; nice wall of foamy lacing is left on the back of the glass and just a few spots and streaks are left holding on to the front.  Smell: Wonderful bitterness that is full of grapefruit and slightly pine-like stickiness; sweet malts that have a hint of a bubblegum sweetness to them. Nose is quite potent, as would be expected from Founders.  Taste: Quite a bit of robust flavors and this beer does not disappoint -- lots of the bitter grapefruit hops that have that bit of sticky pine-like quality to them; nice sweet malts that really do carry that hint of bubblegum sweetness to them and this makes for a great drinkable beer; it's very straightforward drink and you know exactly what you're getting.  Mouthfeel: Body is of moderate weight and the carbonation, while present, is rather soft; a stickiness that starts out thick and moist becomes dry and cottony by the end; a wonderful bitterness lingers in the aftertaste.   Drinkability: This is really an all day kind of beer - wonderful flavors and a body that isn't overly heavy provide for a very refreshing beer... The only downfall to sipping on this one from morning to night would be the 7.2% ABV, while it's not especially high or back breaking, after a couple you definitely feel it.
NEGATIVE	I told everyone that I would give these beers another chance, figure out what's great about them and re-review them accordingly so here it begins. Available on draft at a local beer bar, I had to try it again, even though I have nothing but horrible bad memories of this beer, lets do it again.  Beer is dark brown, but still see through, minimal head, tiny bubbles, sticks close to glass, some lacing on the glass.  This beer smells like bacon, hickory, salt, smoke, smoke, smoke.   This beer tastes like salted and smoked pork. It is relatively smooth, not as bad as I recalled. Medium body, drinkability average, I still don't think I could get through a whole lot of this.  So this is probably the best rauch I've ever had and I may be coming around on this style and these beers because I finished it and I understood it. I still didn't rank it as high as most but I think I'm beginning to understand the general appeal.
POSITIVE	12oz. stubby brown bottled, purchased at Jungle Jim's, poured into a pint. This one doesn't even have a "Founders" notch in the label. They seriously need to just print something or have clear notchings.  A: Pours a dark brown with some distinct red tint. A bit over 1 finger worth of off white head is produced after an average pour. Pretty decent staying power on the head. Strong lacing throughout.  S: Very pleasant peppery rye phenols define the nose. Crisp citrus hops and a sweet biscuit-y malt background makes up the rest.  T/M: I've had this brew several times and I always forget just how damn good it really is. I'm very very happy this is more than accessible in my area at any time. Some interesting sweetness up front, taken over by a spicy pepper and citrus hops body. Alcohol isn't very high but you get a nice rye bite right in the middle. Some biscuit malt character comes in toward the end, just before a controlled drying finish. Just a little bit of lasting bitterness in the end. Body is a very drinkable medium with perfect carbonation.  D: Mike Stevens says this is there best brew. I haven't tried my bottles of KBS yet but this is right up there with their regular Breakfast Stout. Maybe one of the best session beers out there, even at nearly 7%.
NEGATIVE	Sampled from a 12 oz bottle, poured into a pilsner glass out of the fridge; given about 20 minutes to warm up. Picked up in a trade from tempest...thanks!!  A - Aggressively foamy head sits atop a clear, golden color. Carbonation slowed down pretty quickly. Left a quarter-inch, off-white ring with very stick lacing around the glass the whole way down.  S - Faint whiff of grassy notes is the first detectable aroma. After it warmed (and the more I drank), I noticed more of a blend of honey and grassy hops.  T - Somewhat of a bland taste, as the flavors don't develop as hoped. Bitterness follows the mildly-grassy hops, but no real counterparts to the hoppy flavor...it's not overly hopped-up, that's just the only flavor that's really present.   M - Creamy, medium body with a bitter finish; carbonation has dissipated fairly quickly. I enjoy the bitter aftertaste, just wish it was preceded by other flavors.  D - Not really my cup of tea. The hops definitely came out much more as it got warmer and settled down more, but still not as expected. For an English IPA, the unbalance of hops to other flavors is to be expected...but I think it needed just a little somethine else to bring it down a tad.
POSITIVE	Sampled: 12 oz. bottle, in pint glass. Bright golden/amber color, head lasted about one minute (may have dissipated when I stuck my nose into the beer by accident while checking the aroma. Note to self: Watch that next time.)  Aroma: Some light malty notes, but mostly the distinct Ringwood yeast aroma. A bit prickly on the tongue, with a good malt/hop balance that does a pretty good job of quenching the thirst. Hints of alcohols and yeast are also present in the background. The finish is pretty clean, with a nice roundness, but the aftertaste is somehow reminiscent of an ice cream cone - no ice cream, just the cone. And not a sugar cone, either - one of those light yellow Eat-Em-All ones.  Despite all that, it somehow manages to be a rather quaffable beer, even if it isn't up to the standards of its big brother (Old Slugger).
NEGATIVE	Dec 23, 2009 A Christmas gift from Fred, during my visit to the Hoppin' Frog Brewery. Merry Christmas!  A: Thin, iced tea appearance with very little head that disappears almost immediately.  S: CINNAMON I SAID! Fred brews exclusively with Penzey's spices. Fresh cinnamon and nutmeg comprise the initial scent, and honestly, it's hard to smell much else. That being said, it is a very pleasant aroma appropriate for the holiday season.  T: The cinnamon and nutmeg are dominant, which overpowers any ginger flavors intended (as stated on the label). Lingering spice hangs out for a while between sips. I wish this bigger was thicker.   M: Too thin, low carbonation  D: I recommend sharing this with a few folks. As I mentioned, I feel that this beer is too thin and the low carbonation adversely affects the drinkability.
POSITIVE	Poured from 12oz bottle into chalice. No B.O.D. on bottle  Aroma: Bright citrusy hops, biscuity malt, a faint green apple twang, followed by pineapple and grapefruit on the end.  Appearance: Beautiful clear (for style) yellow-golden body. 2-finger head slowly collapses to an off-white foam cap w/ nice lacing on the sides of the glass.  Flavor: Honey sweetness, bold bitternes, musky grapefruit, followed by a sharp bitterness that hangs on at the end.  Mouthfeel: Medium-to-light body for the style. Medium carbonation. Hops are slightly drying on the tongue.  Overall: A decent DIPA with bracing bitterness and fruity hop aroma and flavor. A little bit less than I'd hoped for in the malt department, but it's clear that Founders was aiming for a cleaner, lighter DIPA rather than one with a malty whallop.
NEGATIVE	A - A nice, sap-colored, golden amber or copper. Big three-finger head that almost completely disappeared after about 2 minutes. Not much carbonation.  S - Not much to the smell. Mild orange-sweet citrus, if anything.  T - Much like the smell. Maybe a little wheat as well.  M - Good mouthfeel. Medium-bodied even without much carbonation. This is my favorite part of the beer.  D - Not bad. This one was given to me, and I would definitely drink another free one. Not enough to make me go out and buy one, though.
POSITIVE	A: KBS pours jet black in color with a small mocha colored head that dissipates immediately leaving a few floating bubbles. Light does not penetrate the beer.  S: Strong hints of bourbon, vanilla, and coffee  T: This is most balanced bourbon oaked beer I have ever had. The first thing I taste is bourbon and vanilla followed by rich dark coffee . The flavors really compliment each other, nothing is overpowering. The aftertaste lingers for quite awhile.. I wish it lasted forever.  M: Very smooth and creamy with a medium body. Carbonation doesn't appear in the head but it's definitely there and perfect for the beer.
POSITIVE	Poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass.  Reddish hazy color with a thin cream colored head that is about 1/4" thick.  Alcohol, malt sweetness, with a hop aroma hidden with in the rest  front is a balance of the sweetness and the alcohol, it mellows through the middle, the end the hop flavors come out of this beer, some citrus and other hop flavors  Thick with a light carbonation release   This beer has a high APV cutting back on the over all drinkability but the flavor has a great complexity that make me want to keep drinking it
POSITIVE	Pours a sort of straw color with some orange highlights. Very little head, but I gave it a bit less than aggressive pour.  Aroma is very hoppy, sweet, and floral. A nasal attack. There are citrus hints, lime, rosemary, grapefruit, and pine.   The flavor is actually a bit dry on the tongue. It has the classic IPA elements of citrus and some floral notes, but the flavor is a bit more dry than other IPAs. The hops are there, and no doubt carrying this beer. But the bready undertones are quite present, as well...an interesting balance here. The alcohol is persistent, lingering for some time, but also helping to lift some of the more fruity and bittersweet flavors.  This is a fine example of the style. It has a unique dryness to it, lending to the astringent alcohol. But, through that, the flavors are strong, balanced, and quite delicious.
POSITIVE	Large bottle, with cork and a metel strip, held together with a metel cage. Notches on label tell me?? bottled in or best before 10-05 perhaps, who knows, ah those crazy Belgians...Pours, yellowy brown, cloudy with lots of floaty yeasties and sediment. Active carbonation lifts a huge white head, bubbles continue to rise, settles to a thick film and leaves nice sheeting and whispy lacing. Full throtle nose of barnyard, must and some citrus. Nice drinkable pale/wit/saison kinda thang, complex, yeasty,earthy, crisp and flavorful. love the style/type of beer, would be great with a summer lunch of cheeses, salads, BBQ chicken etc etc, Well worth a try.
POSITIVE	Thanks goes out to one of my trade partners. They sent me this as an extra and I can't remember who it was.   Poured into my pint glass the beer looks like used motor oil out of the bottle. Thick black sludge with about a half a finger of dark mocha head. The head dissapates almost instantly leaving soapy lace.   The aroma is pure rich fudge cake. Some mild coffee along with roasted malt some through as well. It has a great sweetness about it that just makes it smell so delicious. A light hint of booze is noticeable as it warms.  The flavor is heavy on roast malt with mild chocolate and black coffee hints. The booze is rather strong in the flavor for sure.  Full thick and chewy body. Light carbonation.  Overall a real nice RIS. A touch hot in the flavor but not too off putting. Rather drinkable.
NEGATIVE	Chupacabras Pale Ale has a thin, beige head and a cloudy orange-amber appearance. Carbonation is moderate, and filmy lacing remains down the glass. The aroma is of turned or over-ripe citrus. Taste is of citrus, strong coffee, stinging and bitter hops, and barley. Mouth-feel is medium, and Chupacabras finishes refreshing enough, with a caustic after-taste. Overall, this is an okay pale ale. This strong beer really went straight to my head this morning on an empty stomach. I keep messing up with the typing!  RJT
POSITIVE	Poured into a snifter.  Appearance. Dark brown in color, impossible to see through. Pours with a finger and a half of tan head. This dissipates to a nice layer on top of the brew. Nice lacing left on the side of the glass.   Smell. Chocolate malt and roasted coffee intoxicate the nostrils. The smell is so strong and thick that it starts to burn the inside of your nose. A slight hint of berries mixes with the chocolate and roasted scents, making for a quite enjoyable experience.   Taste. Malty bitterness is the first flavor to hit the palate. Sweet, latte or cappuccino like coffee comes next. Another round of malty bitterness separates the coffee form great bittersweet chocolate flavors which come along with that hint of berry that was picked up in the smell. Yet another round of bitterness occurs just before a more sweet chocolatey finish.   Mouthfeel. Surprisingly thick body for a porter, but not yet to the level of a stout. This is helped quite a bit by a moderate to high level of carbonation. Overall it is really light, yet creamy.   This brew is in a heated competition for my favorite porter with the great Edmund Fitzgerald... Awesome
NEGATIVE	I did not know what I was buying with this one. A surprise. I also am unfamiliar with the style. I may have had one a couple times. It would not attract me normally, but as an interesting change of pace ...  This one tastes bold. And strong. I can feel the hair on my chest getting thicker (I really don't need this). The color is a near perfect dark orange. The boozy taste goes well with what I have been eating and drinking. Actually I think this style would go well with heavy food with moderate flavors. It would be the focal point of the meal.   I will have this again (even though I WORK for the man - I am a henchman, don't ya know).
NEGATIVE	A: This in the stout glass is the very definition of sweet thickness: Mocha head, black pudding body, hard to see through the glass. Believe it or not, this old Imperial pint glass of mine hasn't felt this heavy in a long time upon lift.   S: Huge bitter malt smell, with barley, roasted coffee, chocolate, even hops, very complex and rewarding.  T: This beer has an initial huge burst of flavour when it first hits the tongue which pushes a roasted bitterness through until it grasps the back of your mouth and tugs for just a second, then it dissapears like a good dream. Big taste up front but still finishes relatively clean. Alcohol is blended well. You taste it, but it's not overly harsh, it mixes well.  M: Like everything else about this beer, it is thick and very smooth. Won't dissapoint.  D: This is a heavy bottle indeed. It took me the better part of an hour to sip this bottle down, quite a long time, but you'll enjoy it immenseley if you like porters at all. You gotta respect this beer though.
NEGATIVE	Something went wrong here. The beer looks fine and smells like a really bready basic lager (Note: label describes this as a "European Lager"). Unfortunately there is a tremendous amount of yeasty sourness on the palate. I try to peer around the wave of acid broiling my mouth, but all I find is a faint sweet metallic flavor. Sour aluminum dust. Recycled airplane air. Try one of these just to see if our notes are consistent.
POSITIVE	A: Murky reddish brown, hazy with some sediment floating around. Monstrous thick, fluffy head that's tan in color. S: Piney, spicy, dark fruit T: Pine comes through first, leading the way. Biscuity malts with a caramel sweetness lead into the the abundance of spicy rye notes at midpalate, giving off a pepper/earth character. Hops allow for a balanced bitterness towards the finish, with some floral flavors peeking through. Ripened fruits seem to linger on the tongue, while a slight alcohol burn manages to massage the throat.  M: Fairly thick and creamy with moderate carbonation. A slick and oily feel is noted. D: Complex, enjoyable and refreshing. Rye adds a nice kick to the hop character while the malts round out the brew with just the right amount of body and sweetness. Balanced, interesting and enjoyable.
NEGATIVE	12 oz. bottle poured into a pint glass  Appearance: Completely opaque dark oil color. Looks like a more syrupy version of Coca Cola, but blacker. No head. Minimal dark chocolate colored brown lacing. There appears to be plenty carbonation.  Smell: Dark roast coffee is most apparent on the nose. Dark chocolate/bourbon notes are in the nose as well. Slight hints of oatmeal in the background. I'm also picking up the slightest hint of vanilla, although it is masked by the other scents. I can't wait to give this one a taste.  Taste: The arrival consists of dark roasted malts, coffee, and dark chocolate on the foreground with vanilla and sweet bourbon in the background. Very oily, and malty Dark chocolate and smoked tobacco is most apparent on the lingering finish. There is a warming effect with the high ABV. The alcohol comes through in the form of bourbon. From a superficial standpoint, it tastes like a strong bourbon and coke. Over time, it settles down and becomes more manageable. Overall, fairly complex.  Mouthfeel: Full bodied. This one is a bruiser. Moderate carbonation is the only thing separating this beer from the viscosity of oil. Very thick and creamy. Slight drying effect on the finish.  Ending notes: This beer is definitely not for the feint-hearted. it packs a punch at 11.2% ABV. It is a good sipping beer. Definitely not sessionable. I had to take my time with this one. Personally, I prefer the regular Breakfast Stout by Founders. I find that the bourbon was a little too much for me.
NEGATIVE	Beer bottle (33cl), tasted in 2007.  Appearance : clear golden color, with white foam head. Smell : aroma mainly of alcohol, sweet malty. Taste and mouthfeel : sweet malty with notes of alcohol, some hop bitterness in finish. Drinkability : an average beer in the style Strong lager.
NEGATIVE	22oz Cork and Cage Bottle, from Capones in Norristown. (Impulse buy, not something I was initially looking for)  A: Little to no head at all, even with an aggressive pour. From the get go, I knew this had little to no carbonation. Very vicous looking, with no tracing left behind on the glass.   S - Imagine a basic quad, this has the smell. Sugary, yet boozy smelling. No carbonation 'spritz' in the nose either.  T- I was really looking forward to the beer, and even moreso after a long hectic day at work. From the initial pour, I knew that this beer was going to be lacking the punch of a good solid quad. Being that it's got hardly any carbonation, it really detracts form the taste -- in it's place is a watery maple syrup taste. Certainly nothing to write home about, and a 'let down' for a brewers select brew IMO.  M - Flat sugar water is the best I can think of. I have zero carbonation in mine, and this swallows like a beer one has left out overnight.  D - The above reviewer summed it up very well. Not a bad beer by any stretch, however not a good one either. I think this bottle will be more than enough for me in terms of ever buying it again. 'Paid to much' comes to mind, which is a bit disheartening as I was looking forward to a good 'local' PA beer.  Stoudts, you can do better than this. I would love to see more carbonation -- and then I will most certainly purchase again.
NEGATIVE	Reviewed from notes:  appearance: dark brown almost black with no head  smell: caramel, malts,  taste: toffee, roasted malts  mouthfeel: mild carbonation, smooth, medium body  drinkability: due to the smooth texture it's easy to drink.  Cheers,  The CpJ
POSITIVE	Burnt coppery orange that reveals bright tangerine highlights when backlit with sunshine. The golden sandstone colored cap is whipped creamy and forms multiple lace bridges with the sides of the glass. Plenty of lace is simply frosting on the cupcake.  What an interesting nose! Stoudts calls this brew an American style doppelbock. I think it smells like two (or three) parts American IPA to one part doppelbock. Or Oktoberfest. Or some other toasted malty lager. The hoppiness is even more wonderful for being so unexpected.  Smooth Hoperator tastes as interesting and as unique as it smells. It's easy to love a beer with this much good hop flavor. Since I'm not a huge fan of doppelbocks, or Oktoberfests, or other toasted malty lagers, the addition of massive amounts of little green cones can only make them taste better. Style guidelines? We don't need no stinkin' style guidelines! This is a free-for-all of a beer. And a damn good one.  There are two things happening simultaneously within each mouthful. Picture two rivers, one flowing on top of the other. The lower river contains toasted/earthy/nutty malt and the upper river contains citrus and pine sappy hops (Summit and Amarillo). It's a great effect and is one that is becoming more enjoyable with each passing ounce.  The Smooth part of the name isn't a lie. The mouthfeel is nice and soft, in spite of 50 IBUs worth of hops. Actually, like the flavor profile, it's a perfect yin-and-yang combination of silky (malt) and biting (hops). A modest amount of fine-bubbled carbonation helps immensely.  For my money, Stoudts Smooth Hoperator deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as the outstanding Fat Dog (Imperial Oatmeal Stout). Kudos to the brewery for giving us beer geeks something new and different. Not to mention hoppy and delicious.
NEGATIVE	Do you Yazoo? Pours a golden yellow hue with a slight orange hue through out. A good swirl leaving a cloudy appearance with a fizzy head that quickly dissipates.  The nose has noticeable hefe notes. A strong, almost fake banana aroma that dominates. A slight malt aroma with a hint of spice from the wheat. A light bubblegum and cloves aroma are detectable but mostly in the finish. Some yeasty notes but typical. There also is a slight plastic aroma that is board line rubber in the end.  The taste is similar but not as harsh. The banana is still very strong with more malt presence. More generic malt tastes with limited wheat notes. Cloves and Bubblegum both come out a bit stronger but still play second to the banana. Some good yeasty notes with a light pepper finish. Again with the rubber flavor that really is a deterrent.  The body is light to moderate with a light but good carbonation backing. Would have liked more of a balance and back off the banana but some good thing there.
POSITIVE	Just received this brew from Gibby. This beer was in town but I didn't get the opportunity to grab any. Drank from my The Lost Abbey goblet.  Appearance- Pours a murky orange reddish with a small quarter finger white head even with an aggressive decant. A super thin collar remains without much of a cap and zero lacing. Smell- Loads of bourbon and milky vanilla seem to explode out of the beer from the barrels. Maybe a touch of maple and caramelized sugars with a somewhat buttery toffee thing. A bit of booze and sweetness are evident along with a light dark fruity aspect. Raisins and figs mostly but the aroma is most definitely dominated by the barrels. Taste- Not as intense as the nose led me to believe but there's still a lot of flavor in here. A fairly intense bitterness to start that is somewhat citric and somewhat earthy. Think lemon zest and grass. Lots of caramel and toffee add a trivial amount of sweetness. The oak is lightly tannic and fairly prevalent as it adds more of that vanillin I got in the nose. A bit of alcohol mixes in throughout most of the beer and I don't really get anything that screams maple. The bourbon and oak are almost too overpowering to let everything else going on shine. Mouthfeel- Nice full body with a sort of light creaminess and fairly aggressive carbonation. Good stuff. Drinkability- Pretty darned good stuff. I think it may still be a bit young right now as the alcohol is still fairly evident and it may be just slightly too bitter yet. Once everything meshes together a bit more I'm going to dig the shit out of this beer. Thanks much Jeff, you rock!!
POSITIVE	This one pours a....well raspberry-like shade of red, really it does. There is a very small white head that quickly becomes a ring around the glass leaving minimal lacing.  The aroma is pretty mild, there is some raspberry presence but not much else to speak of.  The flavor is heavy with raspberry flavor and there is little touch of sourness that enhances the raspberry. It tastes like this flavor rides on the back of some pilsner malt.  The mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation, almost on the effervescent side.  The drinkability is pretty good. This is a tasty drink that would go down nice on a hot summer day.
NEGATIVE	A: deep blackish/brown body, 2 finger head, nice lacing  S: nice malt aroma, hemp, hint of grass  T: sweet malt front, firm earth, smooth finish  M: med/light body, dry finish  O: Nice brew, surprised by this selection. I enjoy Black Ales and hemp, was concerned this wouldn't work. Nice session when looking for something that's not an IPA or Pale Ale.   NICE, GIVE IT A TRY!
POSITIVE	Thanks to ClockworkOrange and biegaman for this treat.  12 oz. stubby bottler poured into a nonic.  Pours a ruby red with a pink fluffy one finger head that quickly dies down to a thin, almost non-existant, layer. Stickiness is not there at all. Smell is of tart raspberries, almost wine like, very refreshing. Taste is of what else, raspberries and sour in a way, but not too much. Bitter hop bite starts and finishes on the tongue. Raspberry flavor seems to appear more with warming. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and creamy with a good amount of carbonation. Drinkability is pretty good, but NG's Raspberry Tart is a step above.
NEGATIVE	Appearance: coppery brown, good clarity, thinnish layer of frothy light tan foam that slowly compacts to a thin cap  Aroma: malty-nutty brown bread, dates, herbal hops  Flavor: dryish malt backbone with a rye-crisp quality; grassy hop flavor with an early, raspy bitterness; finishes dry, leaving a vegetal, bitter aftertaste  Mouthfeel: medium body, fine carbonation, slightly astringent  Other comments: Not very balanced. The bitterness is a bit sharp at first. You really need to nibble some pretzels or peanuts to level things out a bit.
POSITIVE	Poured a copperish orange color with a magnificent head that retained well and left great decoration lacing on my glassware.  Smells of citrusy and piney hops with a good sweet malt backbone to it.  Taste is extremely balanced between the hop punch and the maltiness. Much grapefruit in the finish, nice and citrusy, with the malt fighting its way throughout the flavor. Nice brew!  Mouthfeel is medium bodied and well carbonated.  Very drinkable IPA despite its hig halcohol content which may hinder the drinkability for most. Despite that, as said, everything else is there to make you want to have one after another...just be careful, it will creep up on ya! Great IPA from Founders...I'd expect nothing less form them.
POSITIVE	Appearance: Pours dark golden with a big frothy two-finger head with sustaining power. Lots of sticky lace, and very fine sediment floating throughout the beer.  Smell: A little lacking here - it took a few sniffs to be able to recognize anything. Aromas of floral hops, bubble gum, and citrus.  Taste: A touch of hop flavor and bitterness is present, but it's balanced with very strong malt sweetness. I don't feel that this taste is characteristic of your typical IPA. but it is very complex and very good.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied, light carbonation, very smooth and totally excellent.  Drinkability: This beer does not seem to fit the typical mold of an IPA. With that said, however, it is very easy to drink and a very good beer.
POSITIVE	Pours a hazy, golden yellow color with a white head. In the aroma, a small dryness and a fruity, white grape-ish smell. In the taste, just like the aroma, dry fruitiness, with white grape being the the biggest flavor. A smooth and medium to small bodied mouthfeel and a dry lager like aftertaste. Nice fruitiness and quite smooth, nice lager.
POSITIVE	Served by Beer Sellar in Nashville. Very dark brown, opaque beer, wtih half-inch wide cocoa-colored head, dissolving rapidly to narrow band, with moderate to fine lacing. Hint of chocolate or coffee smell, but very light aroma; would have liked more "nose". Light to moderate carbonation. Taste was dry, with hint of chocolate and/or coffee undertones with a mildy bitter aftertaste. Mouthfeel somewhat oily, but not unpleasantly so. A very tasty stout, not the best I've tried, but definitely worth drinking another time.
POSITIVE	appearance - light, golden fairly clear. low carbonation. smell - maple syrup, wheat, and booze taste - super smooth flavor. its a bit hot, but the maple does well to balance everything. mouth - kind of thick, but low carbonation. overall - great beer, but will be giving it some time to drink any more.
POSITIVE	A: KBS pours jet black in color with a small mocha colored head that dissipates immediately leaving a few floating bubbles. Light does not penetrate the beer.  S: Strong hints of bourbon, vanilla, and coffee  T: This is most balanced bourbon oaked beer I have ever had. The first thing I taste is bourbon and vanilla followed by rich dark coffee . The flavors really compliment each other, nothing is overpowering. The aftertaste lingers for quite awhile.. I wish it lasted forever.  M: Very smooth and creamy with a medium body. Carbonation doesn't appear in the head but it's definitely there and perfect for the beer.  D: MOAR
POSITIVE	tasted this at the michigan brewers guild winter beer fest. from my notes i wa served a jet black sample with a nice brown head the aroma was rich with coffee, vanillia, and malt the flavor had a great vanillia, good coffee undertone, malt, with a wounderful chocolate in the finish. the mouthfeel is very full. beer is very drinkable.
POSITIVE	Green cap bottle poured into a pint glass. Purchased from my regular store, the beer guy there told me he had had it for about a year.  A. Poured into a finger of cocoa brown head. The dark brown to black body is familiar, as I just reviewed the regular B.O.R.I.S. two days ago. Head recedes quickly and only light lacing is noticed.  S. The aroma starts off malty and goes into a straight booze aroma. The chocolate and coffee are noticeable after the beer begins to warm.  T. Dark chocolate and roasted malt kick off the flavor party for me on this one. The hop presence is quite faint and quickly passes into a very interesting mix of woodyness and chocolate, as if someone were aging chocolate milk in bourbon barrels. Ends with a subdued bourbon flavor.  M. Full bodied and mouth coating, but more balanced than original B.O.R.I.S. and not quite as thick. A decent amount of carbonation make this a good beer.
POSITIVE	This beer is freaking awesome. No, they don't have a special release for this beer like Dark Lord or Darkness or Hunahpu. But if they did this beer would be completely sought after and considered rare.   Awesome mouthfeel, delicious chocolate flavor assault the palate and nostrils upon first sip. There's nothing that can be done to improve on this beer. On of my top 5 favorite stouts of all time.   Thanks Founders, for making this accessible to people without having us have wait in a line at 8am for a 1 day only release.
NEGATIVE	A - Practically black with a very light head, tiny carbonation bubbles fighting their way through thickness. An intimidating void.   S - Aroma hits you even as the glass sits on the table. Smells rich and sweet, like fresh-ground coffee and cocoa without the abject sweetness of a mocha. The notes of bourbon linger in the background.   T - The first note that hits is a surprising tartness, which is indicative of it's 70 IBU rating, but it is immediately followed by the sweetness you expect from this kind of beer. The coffee flavor brings up the rear and finishes very mildly leaving a pleasant carmel aftertaste. Gets a much stronger bourbon character once you let it warm up to room temp.  M - Perfect. It's velvet on the tongue. If it weren't for the taste you might not know it was there.  D - The only reason this rating is so low is because you have to drink it at breakfast. You just have to. Any other time of day and it wouldn't be a breakfast stout. However, the kind of mornings for which you need a breakfast stout are limited so the drinkability is necessarily a bit low. Definitely not gonna give you the same buzz as a cup of coffee.
POSITIVE	Want a tripel without the cloy?? This stuff is for you. Nose is spicy, lemon, funk, and a little nip of the funk. The farmhouse backbone is there too. I enjoyed the sniff.   Great medium and crispy body for a tripel!! Trips are one of my least favorite styles, because they can just grab you with all that sweetness and warmth and stick to the beating, but I had to get this because I love CBC, and I'm not disappointed. That being said, I couldn't drink more than a serving of this. Nice sweet potassium fruit flavors and funk with a constant light spicy nipping. Good for the season too. I'm blushing already. Good work, CBC!
NEGATIVE	2003 was a good batch. A number of bottles released late, better than never. Yeasty date fruit aroma. Pleasant dark. Restrained spice there, decent on a late summer night. Chilled a bit worked for me. However fizzy with syruppy sugar and cinammon,cloves, bit of nuttiness. Way below a Unibroue and in the basement compared to the Belgiums, but decent for a local.
POSITIVE	Poured from a 12oz bottle into a snifter:  Appearance and Smell:Poured a nice opaque black similar to ten fidy. Left a nice thick, extremely dark brown creamy head which left nice layers of lacing down the glass. Smelled of very rich chocolate. Quite a bit of roastiness present, with a bit of caramel malt which compliments its nicely and helps hide the mild warmth on the nose from this one.  Taste and Mouthfeel:I really enjoy the flavor of this brew. Quite a bit of milky chocolate and molasses. Very rich decadant brew with some feint bitterness on the tail which really makes this brew. Pretty medium to heavy bodied brew which was slick and creamy on the tongue. Just enough bitterness to keep any of the sweetness from being too much. The last few sips of this were nothing far from delicious.  Drinkability:Very drinkable considering the style, and ABV of this brew. The very mild warmth and creamy body make this thing just slide down. Enough complexity to keep me sipping. I highly recommend trying this one.
POSITIVE	Thanks to redbird for this one.  A: A bit light in color but it's well within the range that I've seen. The color is yellow gold with a white head that leaves good lacing.  S: A bit generic for a DIPA but still very hoppy and delicious. The caramel malt is there underneath the hops, but it gets a little boozy in the aroma and flavor.  T: Orange and floral hops dominate. There's enough malt to hold up to the hops, but it doesn't quite blend as well as the best DIPAs. Again, a bit boozy and not quite bitter enough for my taste.  M: Good, oily with hop essence.  D: It's definitely a good beer, but it doesn't stand out from the pack of DIPAs for me. Good beer but there are better entries in the style.
POSITIVE	As this bottle was brewed at the Lion Brewery in Wilkes Barre, PA.... this is obviously an older sample as their contract operations have been moved to the Frederick Brewery in Maryland. It pours a clear, deep golden body with a frothy white head that leaves some nice lace throughout the glass. The nose displays some lightly peppery/spicy hops over a gently sweet malt. The body is medium with a fine, median carbonation that leaves it crisp on the tongue before warming to become a touch creamy and smooth. The flavor delivers a rounded malt that obviously includes a good percentage of Munich malt. It's just lightly toasty and a tad sweet, but very well-balanced by lightly floral and gently herbal hop flavors and firm bitterness. It finishes dry but with a lingering maltiness. Quite nice, and highly drinkable. It's refreshing, but also offers enough character to make you want another. A good example of the Munich helles style at a very nice price. Well done, and certainly worth trying!
NEGATIVE	Poured from a 22 oz bottle into a tulip glass. Saved this about 5 months after purchasing it. Pours a nice dark mahogany color with a little light tan/off-white head that will leave a decent amount of lacing on the glass.  On first smell it gives off a nice bit of aroma from the dark malts: caramel with a bit of toffee and raisins and some citrus. It continues into the flavor of the beer with the dark malts that contribute a toffee/caramel/bready taste to it. The mouthfeel is a bit thin but smooth overall.  A fairly decent beer all-in-all, it may not be exactly to style but is worth a taste if you want something close to it.
POSITIVE	A - A light orangish honey color... Two fingers of white foam quickly fizzes leaving a full rich lace... The lace is thicker around the glass and thinner in the center... On the slightest bit of carbonation can be noted towards the top of the glass... The foam clings to the sides of the glass...   S - A truly wonderful hoppy nose... Assertive and strong, but not off-putting as many DIPAs seem to be now a days.... A lovely mix of citrus and piney... There's is also a very strong candied sugar malt base...   T - A wonderfully well balanced brew... The piney hops are the strongest flavor but barely surpass the flavors of the citrus hops and malt backbone... Terrific...   M - Delicate and straight forward... Medium bodied... Some prickly carbonation on the tongue... It's hard not to love the lush creaminess... Ever so slight sticky hop resins.... The 9.4% ABV is well covered... Very dry finish...   D - It seems that Founders never disappoints (probably why they are one of my favorite two breweries).... In the world of craft beer, where it seems high quality DIPAs are all the rage, Founders Double Trouble deserves to be part of the conversation...   Note - Quite arguably my favorite label in all of beerdom...
NEGATIVE	Pours a clean pale yellow color with a small white head. In the aroma, faint sweetness to a standard European lager. In the taste, dry malt and a small bite, but thin and not much going on. A small bite and light bodied mouthfeel, with a dry standard lager kind of aftertaste. Nothing too exciting here, I guess that is why I don't golf!
POSITIVE	This was a clearly well-balanced beer. Too often when we get hopped beers, it becomes a hop bomb, and I am of the persuasion that interesting beers are interesting, but quaffable beers are paragon. The familiar grassy, floral smell of hops is present in the nose, but the taste was not dominated completely by hops. They were there, of course, but played well with the malt too and neither bashed you over the head. That's what I appreciated about this beer.
POSITIVE	Appearance: Black gold, texas tea... Minus the gold part. This beer pours thick and black. It leaves a nice dark tan head with divine lacing on the side of the glass.  Aroma: Roasted Burnt Coffee. You can almost smell the texture of the ground beans. There is a bit of sweetness in the beginning, but almost everything in the smell comes from the coffee.  Taste: The beer rolls across the tongue, picking up bitterness as it heads back. The finish isn't too dry, but it is definately roasty and bitter. Burnt roast lingers in the mouth as you contemplate the next sip. The mouthfeel is solid, if a little oily.  Notes: Don't drink this if you hate coffee. I'm not a coffee fan, but this because of the roasty bitterness this one wins for me. The aroma and flavor both make me think of coffee grounds. And I can almost visualize them in the beer, because the images conjured from the smell is so powerful. Good big stout. Very drinkable.
NEGATIVE	500ml thin-necked dark brown bottle into snifter. The thin neck made it impossible to get a smooth pour. Best by Sept 23, '09.   Crystal clear light honey color with a one finger white head that settles to an almost invisible cap.   Very light malts, with a bit of a syrupy sugary aroma. The hops add a sligtlly bitter, and very perfumy aroma.   The flavor consists of some light, slightly watery grains. The hops add a little bit of leafy bitterness, but not much.   Something about this beer just doesn't make it that drinkable. The flavor is slightly acerbic, and the hops seem to have an odd characteristic.
POSITIVE	Appearance: Pours a dark black color with two finders worth of dark tan head. The head collapsed fairly quickly, but left decent spotty lacing on the walls of my pint glass. Smell: Dark roasted malt and black malt dominate with chocolate, sorghum, and coffee present as well. Taste: The flavor profile is a rich combination of the things in the nose with plenty of roasted grain, a touch of grassy hops, dark chocolate, and coffee combine into a wonderful drinking experience. Mouthfeel: Good carbonation with coats the mouth nicely, with the alcohol hidden quite well. Drinkability: I will certainly be buying this beer again. This is pretty much everything I am looking for in a porter.
POSITIVE	A somewhat cloudy amber color. A 1-finger head that dissipated slowly. Fresh hops in the aroma. Over the top flavor but not overly bitter. As far as this being atriple IPA at 112 IBUs, it doesn't taste any bitter than most IPAs and double IPAs. The 12% alcohol is present but there isn;t the noticable alcohol burn on the tongue. A big beer but not what I would call a triple IPA.
POSITIVE	This beer pours a dark rose color with a thin white head. The aroma is very tart, like unripe rasberries. The taste is very fruity but with enough malt and carbonation that you still know that you're drinking beer. I didn't pick up much of a belgian yeast flavor or aroma. The mouthfeel was light and I definitely wouldn't have known this was a 9.2%abv beer if it didn't say so on the bottle. This was proably the most enjoyable fruit beer I've ever had, although for the price ($26 in Philly) I don't know if this is something I'd consistently purchase were it not a seasonal release.
POSITIVE	A: looks nice. Dark orange or a copper with a nice size head.   S: fair hops then followed by a nice rose scent.  T: nice hop character here. Hint of beady rye and a pleasnt floral clean finish.   M: I know this is not supposed to a really big red so the mouthfeel fits the style and size of the beer. light to medium and very drinkable.  D: really nice session beer. I wouldnt mind having another one.   Thoughts: Im pretty sure I have never had a bad or even average beer from Founders. I might be byased on this review. Everytime I have a Founders beer I think I already give it the benefit of the doubt. Probably not the best thing but w/e they rock.
POSITIVE	Appearance: The brew is just a solid golden color - nothing more nothing less. Head formation is quick, but it fades quickly; thus, the retention and lacing are minimal. There isn't a whole lot of carbonation, either. It looks pretty average to me.  Smell: This may sound strange, but it really does smell like grass. There are also mild hints of bitterness from the hops and a slight biscuit character from the malt. Sweetness seems to be absent while the grassy smell seems to dominate.  Taste: It doesn't taste nearly as grassy as it smells. The biscuity malt flavor is fairly strong and complimented nicely by the bitterness of the hops. This brew is not excessively bitter and is also augmented with some slight spiciness; both are present in the aftertaste. It seems that the "KISS" philosophy applies here - not bad at all.  Mouthfeel: Though this is a pretty light beer, it's not watery by any means. It doesn't feel too heavy in the mouth or on the tongue.  Drinkability: This brew finishes crisply and cleanly. Combine this with the fact that it's pretty light and you've got one poundable beer. The flavor isn't bad, but you wouldn't miss too much if you did, in fact, decide to "pound" this.  Summary: This is better than some other pilsners that I've had. While there doesn't really seem to be anything special about this beer, I'd say it's somewhat above being merely average simply because the bitterness isn't too excessive. The grassy smell isn't nearly as strong in the flavor and the maltiness is just right. It seems like a well-balanced, easily poundable import - not really much to complain about.
NEGATIVE	Thanks to bu11zeye for sharing this bottle.  The beer pours a dark brown color with a tan head. The aroma is heavy on the roasted malt with some dark fruit and chocolate. Smells about like a porter is supposed to smell.  The flavor is similar. I get a lot of roasted malt and chocolate, but there is also a nice undertone of vanilla. There is a little dark fruit but it is well hidden and more prominent in the aroma.   Medium to thick mouthfeel and low carbonation.
POSITIVE	Pours a slightly hazy copper and orange color crowned with a creamy, one-finger white head. The head gives off a bold vinous aroma with complex hints of vanilla and maple. The flavor is even more complex! The thick viscous body and low carbonation allow the drink to flow slowly and smoothly. Big bourbon flavor with a sweet background slowly evolves into a more vinous taste with sudden flashes of vanilla and maple syrup. The finish warms and continues the cameo appearances of the complex aged flavors. The finish is very slow and lingers as it warms your core. Yum.
POSITIVE	This was the thickest looking beer I have ever poured. It was like oil or molasses. Thick with no head, none at all, nadda, not even a bubble. No lace ethier, very odd for an RIS. Smell was very nice. Deep dark chocolate and roasted coffee mixed in with hints of vanilla and sugar. Very sweet, and damn near perfect smell on this, fine job, very rich and desert like. The taste was strong, and definatly packed a punch. Very sweet, with the biggest flavor here being roasted coffee and chocolate. Definate alcohol presence here whci at 10% is not shock. Again the feel was very thick, but the lack of carbonation hurt it, as it did not feel as creamy as it could have been. This left the mouthfeel a bit dull and flat. The finish was nice, dry and somewhat hoppy. This one needs more carbonation. The flatness in the mouthfeel takes away from the great aromas and flavors it possess. Maybe/hopefully it was just a bad bottle, will have to seek this one out again.
POSITIVE	Picked up a single with the new pry cap, no more twist offs. Poured into a pub glass off a rigorous pour, producing little head. No lace is left behind and a smallish collar of retention is left. Faint haze to this, but mostly transparent.   Aroma is unimpressive, mild floral hop aroma and malt, some caramel and breadyness but really a subdued aroma for one that is dry hopped.   Hop forward in flavors though which is a nice change from aroma. Bittering hops up front, mixing with pine and mild rind peel, some malt comes through creating nice balance. Through the middle is great fresh grain flavors, cereal like bordering husky but not crossing the line.  Finishing crisp and mild bitter linger and a little bit of aspirin.  A good clean beer all around. This could use oomph in aroma and maybe some flaked barley for a bit more foam presence and longer lasting head.
POSITIVE	Poured from a 500ml bottle into a pint glass.  A- dark brown almost like a porter.  S- roasted, malt, sweet smell. Nice. T- sweet, roasted malts. caramel dark flavours. Loving it. M- medium mouthfeel, quite thick but not obviously as much as an IRS.  Overall a very good beer, my favourite Doppelbock.
NEGATIVE	22 oz brown bomber with a nice colorful & informative label. All it lacks is some freshness dating.   Poured into my SA pint glass, the beer is orange/amber and it has a minimal white head and zero lacing.   Big spice aroma. It hits all the notes of cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, etc. There is a bit of grain behind the spice.   The beer's taste leads with sweetness and more spice. There is some grains and grass in the background but spices rule here. No real pumpkin flavor, but the spices cover for that.   The mouth is thickish and it may have the best mouth feel of any pumpkin beer I've sampled.    This borders on a dessert beer and is not really a session beer for me as it is sweet. I split the bomber with my wife and both of us enjoyed it.
POSITIVE	So here I am cleaning my keg and thinking to myself why not drink a brew. I had just done a run the other day and picked up some bocks I have not had. Redish brown when held in the light. On the table more of a dark brown. Very light head from the poor. Minimal lacing and fingers around edges. So far looks fab. I love the smell of Caramunich malt. Light hop aroma what is there is pleasant and only subtle. Taste is magnificent with very malty taste with caramel. Sweet on the tongue and cheeks but not so much so. The hops really bring out the flavor profile of the grain. Medium to slight thickness in the mouth with little carbonation to tickle the tongue. One of the best bock I have had.
NEGATIVE	Pours a rather typical clear yellow with a foamy white head. Aroma is not strong, but is crisp and malty if not inspiring. Flavor, fortunately, is better - malty and a little fruity with a faint and not too unpleasant tinny undertone. Texture is smooth and just a little fizzy. Overall, fair to middlin' and leaning towards middlin'.
POSITIVE	Pours nutbrown, cloudy, with off white head. Head is thin butreluctant to disappear enitrely, thinly covering surface through most of consumption. Smells like hops, fresh and clean. Taste is well defined hoppiness quickly followed by alcohol coming out in the back of mouth and soon followed by stong citrus rind bitter feeling. The bitter atertaste is mostly gone in about 15 seconds. Mouthfeel is fine, tangy and cleansing of previous flavors. Doesn't overpower food flavors, this is an acceptable amount of bitterness to pair with saucy Chinese (my current meal).  This is a slow drinking beer, but not quite complex enough to merit sipping. There's not much masking of the alcohol in this brew which both limits it's drinkability but contributes nicely to the flavor This beer is definately worthy of comparison to your favorite strong IPA.
POSITIVE	This beer is most easily described as ringwood-light. No it's not a lite beer, but it has trademark ringwood taste, but is lighter than others of the same yeast. Gold colored and smelled of light fruits. Tasted of apple and orange with a slight grassy bitterness. The bitterness didn't seem to fit for me. I'd keep this one malty, that is unless you like your blonde ales hoppy.
NEGATIVE	"We are living in a world today where lemonade is made from artificial flavors and furniture polish is made from real lemons."  --Alfred E. Neuman  Haystack yellow with fuzzy lemon peel highlights and a 7UP-like crown that fizzed into the atmosphere inside of five seconds. No head and no lace results in an appearance that is nothing like beer. Wait, this is shandy. It still doesn't look good.  The aroma is a tough call because it's pleasantly lemony and I'm a lemonophile. Trouble is, it smells nothing like beer. Wait, this is shandy. It should still smell like beer, even if only a little.  Turbo Shandy is the best hard lemonade that I've ever had. Granted, this makes about three total. It has the right amount of sweetness, the right amount of lemon flavor, the right amount of pale maltiness, and the right ABV to deliver a solid flavor punch without crossing the line into 'shot of grain alcohol' nastiness.  On second thought, the smell score deserves to be above average, especially given the style. There really isn't much to say regarding the flavor profile. It's an incredibly simple combination of pale malts and lemon, with the proportions right where they should be.  The mouthfeel is light-medium and isn't as fizzy as expected. The bubbles are actually well done. The sugars give it a stickiness that lightly coats the mouth and tongue after each sip. Like lemonade, just not to the same extent.  Turbo Shandy is a pretty good summertime (non-beer) beverage, as long as you know what you're getting into. Again, this is what all hard lemonades should taste like. If this offering is the replacement for Smashin' Berry Ale and Smashin' Berry Dark, then it's a smashing success.
POSITIVE	on-tap, snifter treatment at the brewery  appearance: nice branded snifter (could do without the URL, but hey, they're new...), bright orange body, fluffy white cap  smell: citrusy hops, big sweet caramel core  taste: some spice from the rye but mostly structural support for the hop profile - oily pine and citrus, moderate bitterness, chewy caramel and dough. Good stuff - a nice introduction  mouthfeel: big-bodied, moderate bitterness  overall: straight out of the gates with the Rye DIPA - nice
NEGATIVE	12oz bottle Best Before 01/19/08  A- Pours an amber color with orange hues an a nice off-white head that possesses good lacing and retention.  S- Very nice malty aroma with toasted malt and caramel, and a slight metallic twang that is a bit distracting.  T- The taste like the aroma is dominated by the toasted malt with a mild hop bitterness in the finish.  D- This is a pretty good American produced Oktoberfest that is worth a shot.
POSITIVE	Look: One finger thick chestnut head, almost totally black (looks about 39 SRM), beautiful lacing.  Smell: Cocoa, Coffee, Chili, Milk, Smoky, Cinnamon  Taste: Massive Coffee, Milky, Smoky, Roasty, Dark Chocolate, Light Bitterness, Good creamy mouthfeel.  Final Thoughts: Pretty good. Not as strong chocolate as I would have thought. It's almost like a cocoa accented coffee with cream. Alot of hype on this one. I don't know that it meet that hype but it still is very good. More than worth the buy.
NEGATIVE	Beer is dark brown and forms an off white to tan head of small bubbles / medium bubbles that leaves some lacing on the glass. Beer is clear at the corners.  Mildly sweet, oddly grainy aroma.  Beer is thin and has an odd late bitterness / aftertaste that tastes like wheat and roasted grains. There is little in the forward palate and its not a very desirable beer.
POSITIVE	Review #350 - finally getting around to reviewing this classic brew. Picked up a ton of the '09 vintage at the release party. Served in my Surly pint glass.  A - One finger of dark tan/mocha foam that slowly dissipates to a solid cap and ring and leaves a pretty solid lace. Pitch black brew, with no light anywhere to be found. The only thing lacking is head volume, which is forgivable for a 11.2% brew.  S - Intense smell of coffee, chocolate, vanilla, bourbon, and roasted malts. Strongly reminds me of a Coffee Crisp chocolate bar soaked in whiskey, which is a great thing as I love both of those things. As it warms up there are more subtle notes of wood and hazelnuts. It's just a wonderfully balanced and well-integrated combination of flavors.  T - The taste is terrific, but not quite as rich as the smell. Very strong onset of chocolate and vanilla flavors, before transitioning into light whiskey and a strong roasty bitterness that lingers well into the aftertaste. Never tastes particularly hot or over-the-top.  M - Very low carbonation, super creamy and soft in texture, with a mediuum-thick body. Leaves behind lots of residual stickiness that complements the roasty aftertaste. There's a nice bit of warming that happens after a while.  D - This is one of the few high ABV barrel-aged stouts where I want more than a single 12oz bottle. The lovely sweet flavors keep the booziness from getting out of hand and the wonderful texture makes it something I just can't stop sipping.  It's exceptional that a beer that is pretty readily available (at least during March) maintains such a high level of quality. One of the few stouts in the top 100 that isn't overrated.
POSITIVE	Pours a death black, with a thick head of tan foam. Thick lace, too.  Aroma is roasted dark chocolate. Mmmm. Already a winner before it hits the tongue.  Flavor is strong -- bold chocolate. Finish gets the roasted burnt malts. This one's a sturdy, heavy-bodied treat, and undeniably a picture perfect porter.
NEGATIVE	Thanks to d0b for pointing me in the right direction to pick this up at Evanston 1st Liquors.  A: Very dark, hazy brown. Nice dark reddish edges against the light. A vigorous pour hardly generates a head. Nice spotting on the glass. A very delicate ring and a wispy head.  S: Candy sweet roasted malt. Alcohol - of the bourbon persuasion of course. Some dark cherry. A little medicinal.   T: There is definitely a hint of vanilla, some dark cherry type fruit. More dominant is the great roasted sweet malt but it gets dominated by the alcohol. I like the bourbon essence but the alcohol burn takes away from some of the enjoyment for me. The aftertaste is a combination of tea and alcohol bitterness.   M: A touch of carbonation prickliness, a medium/light body. Pretty smooth overall but a little sharp with the alcohol at the finish.  D: This is not my favored style of ale but I did enjoy it. It was nice to drink it out of a thistle glass and just sip away. The kind of beer that makes you question what beer is - a sophisticated and acquired taste. I tend to enjoy high ABV brews that mask the alcohol a little better but I will look forward to the other 2 bottles I have left. It's a quality brew and I would recommend giving it a try. I ate some Gouda with this - good call. It balances it out very nicely.
POSITIVE	Deep redbrown color with nice even carbonation feeding a off white, almost light brown , creamy head which holds on for a while and leces very nice. The smell prepares for exceptional smokehouse aromas, yet has still some fruitiness in it. The taste is phaenomenal. From fruit to smoked ham, nice caramel undertones and a smooth finish. Mouthfeel is very smooth yet has great carbonation in the beginning and finishes smooth in the back. I want more, fantastic beer which rarely gets better.
POSITIVE	2011 Imperial Stout  A: Pours a very dark brown, but not quite black. Had a tiny ring of mocha foam that dissipated right after the pour was finished.  S: Maybe my sniffer is off, but I am not getting as much aroma as I remember this beer having, especially for an imperial stout. I get a hint of espresso, but that's it.  T: The taste is right as I remember. Sweet roasted malts that give way to bakers chocolate and some espresso. Not too hot either.  M/D: This beer had very low carbonation, but it allowed the creamy characteristics to come out. I think this is beers is one of the easiest imperial stouts to go down. smooth, rich, yet complex.
NEGATIVE	A - Deep black, opaque. Faint ruby highlights are gleaming through. There is a nice big 2inch head on this thing and as I let it sit, it laces nicely.    S - Straight off the bat , it's old coffee grounds. Its not iced coffee, or a frappachino, but old coffee grains. There is a light mixture of some chocolate, in the middle but then turns to deep roasted grains.   T - The aromas transfer over to the taste and make it almost a balanced beer, but not quite. The deep coffee grain is turning to mud, and in turn taking the grains with it. The chocolate is no where to be found in true form but only a perceived notion of its previous existence is left behind. Out of all the reviews I have read, I cant believe no one has picked up the high rubbing alcohol flavor in the back of this beer. Either this needs to age, or this thing is a mess.   M - One of the good things about this beer is the mouth feel. It starts off smooth with the carbonation/bitterness, and then smooths out to a nice creamy mouth feel. The alcohol warms the as it sits, and then warms the throat.   D - I hope this thing needs to age. I really do. Maybe then it will be a true 93/Outstanding beer. But for a rather fresh beer. It's not even close.
POSITIVE	8/20/2011  750ml bottle dated 2011 poured into a mini snifter. Thanks to Skuter for sharing this at our bottle share!  A: Pours red, basically a cranberry juice red. No lacing present, slight pink colored head that fades, and the carbonation seems about medium.  S: Smells heavy of raspberries, artificial slightly, with not much else going on. The booze is disguised pretty much on the nose. Aromas of juice, a faint wateriness, and light vinegar.  T: The taste is on par with the smell. Heavy raspberry fruit flavors, while the booze is mostly hidden. Slight cough syrup texture, with great tastes all around; but it just doesnt really taste like beer.  M: Light bodied, with I would assume to be medium carbonation levels (the bottle we sampled had leaked a bit during shipment). The beer is out of balance with sweetness, but its still pretty tasty. The booze of this years release at 9.2% ABV is incredibly disguised.  O: This was a great tasting fruit beer. A little too sweet for my tastes, and I would have liked to see some sour notes to help balance everything out, but its still a solid beer. I didnt think it lived up to all the attention its got, but maybe thats just me!
NEGATIVE	Probably the worst product of this nice Slovenian brewery.  Color bright yellow, with an amber streak, high level of carbonation, small short-living head, practically no lace.  Smell hoppy, herbal, floral, weak but quite pleasant.  Start watery, body very thin, taste uninteresting with faint notes of this and that, finish on the hoppy side, short uninspiring aftertaste.  A faulty interpretation of famous German style. Canned version is lower on alcohol: 3.5% ABV only.
POSITIVE	A hoppy but not overly bitter beer. Refreshing sweetness but still true to its IPA nature. Well balanced for a 10+% ABV. I really enjoyed the traditional inital taste, which flowed into a less intense, more flavorful finish for an IPA. Really enjoyed it.
NEGATIVE	Clear amber, decent lace. Nothing special.  Nose has an intriguing oak waft, like fresh oak, with a slight bit of bourbon. Not sure where the actual beer is.  The Oak hits hard up front, with the bourbon to follow, but they linger because the actual beer does not hold up - the storage tastes dominate, and leave this taste very unbalanced, some hops noticiable at the end with slight malt, but malt looses the battle here.  Mouthfeel is good with heaviness, but the drinkability suffers greatly from the lack of balance, you would have to be eating a wood grilled fish to enjoy this, couldn't finish the bottle.  The un-oaked version of this is much better.
POSITIVE	Poured into a Duvel Snifter:  A: Pours a very light brown, with minimal carbonation.  S: A smoked ham scent is very noticeable. Sweet malts.  T: Oak Smoke and smoked ham with a sweet malty finish.  M/D: Could have used a bit more carbonation. Overall it was very good, but needed just a little more bite to the mouthfeel.
POSITIVE	Big head though beer smell, lace, and nice reddish dark colour. Well malted. Carbonation on the aggressive side. Overall bold taste, with some herbal addition. There is a bit of yeast and wheat in the taste. Good finish.A good Vienna, thanks to Jan Biegeman. Good with food.
POSITIVE	Made with Pale, Wheat, and Munich malts, and Saaz hops exclusively. OG=1.044, 3.8% ABV, 20 IBU.  Drank on tap at Pikes BC in Seattle, WA.  Slightly cloudy, light orange brew forms a good-sized white head with good retention and lacing. Aroma is faintly of apples with no cloves or bananas. Clearly an American Hefe, which I tend to dislike. Taste begins with toasty pale malts, has a saccharin tenacity in the middle, and ends in a crisp, floral bitterness with a well-balanced, lightly dry finish. There is a hint of alcohol towards the end. Mouthfeel is bright and spritzy. This is a pale ale by all respects.
NEGATIVE	I was excited to drink this beer as I love DIPA's. I was not impressed at all. It looked the same as most Imperial or Double IPA's amber/orange with a puffy white head that sticks around. It smells very sweet, hoppy, grapefruit.   The taste was not very good to say the least. Slighty spicy, very sweet, sharp alcohol flavor. The aftertaste of alcohol was VERY strong. This is not a beer for the faint of heart. Stoudt's should have done a better job hiding the booziness of this beer. The mouthfeel was great though, oily, hoppy, slick on the tongue.  Dogfish Head's 90 minute is the best DIPA I have ever had and I will continue to try new ones until I find a beer I like half as much in the style. This is not it... Not Stoudt's best effort.
NEGATIVE	The aroma is very smokey and covers any other smells that might be there save a hint of malt. The appearance is dark brown and the head is persistent. The flavor is also very smokey and not unlike beef jerky. The palate was not as thick as I wanted but still its not thin. A very unique beer that's a must try, like it or not.
POSITIVE	I will say this up front, I am not a stout guy. I normally can't drink a full bottle of a stout. I have had 2 that I liked...this is one of them.  A: Darkness, brown head that doesn't stick around for a long time, but laces nicely as I drink. 4  S: Really smells like I'm about to drink some coffee with a little chocolate in it. Earthy tones as well. 4.5  T: I was ready to hate the taste. I really was. But wow, I get the hype. Smooth chocolate starts it off, like a melted candy bar. Then it takes a backseat to the coffee, which isn't too dry or too much like coffee, its just an enjoyable flavor. Then it all subsides to a wonderful aftertaste. 4.5  MF: Full bodied and heavy. Creamy, but smooth. 4.5  D: Very high for a stout. This beer should be enjoyed as long as possible. 5  A LOT has changed since the review above. This was one of my "gateway" stouts, which are now my absolute favorite. I am now reviewing a 1 year old bottle, dated "9/10/10". I should get around to re-reviewing a fresh one as well!  A: The appearance is pretty much the same. Deep, dark brown pour with a light brown head. Not a great retention, but the lacing is great. 4  S: The coffee, as expected, has really stepped back. This has become a chocolate bomb with hints of vanilla and molasses. 4  T: Gotta say the taste has stepped back already on this guy. I remember fresh FBS being absolutely top notch, this taste is ordinary. Chocolate, molasses, a bit watery. Reminds me a lot of their Imperial Stout, but not quite as good. The defining characteristics that made this a great beer have gone. 3  MF: Not quite as full bodied, certainly still creamy. Carbonation is still fine but the finish is not as dry. 4  O: This category has changed since last time! Drinkability is fine, but overall this aged version is but a small glimmer of its former phenomenal self, but I do still like it. 4
POSITIVE	On tap and later in a bottle, this brew is strong and assertive. It does mellow the more you drink it- maybe due to warming a bit or because it's high alcohol content (both I guess). It has a very sweet almost honey like aroma. Taste is also on the sweeter side, really seems made in the style of an English Strong Ale(which is what is it supposed to be). Carmel predominates in this beer. It's a little too one-sided, made to be strong, yet kind of a one hit wonder. Not a bad beer by any means. It's enjoyable when one is in the mood for a strong ale. I like that American brewers are trying to make different styles of ale like this one.
NEGATIVE	Pours a cloudy, golden color. 1/4 inch head of a white color. Slight retention and slight lacing. Smells of citrus (blackberry), syrup, and slight sweet malt. Fits the style of an American Pale Wheat Ale. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp with an average carbonation level. Tastes of citrus, slight yeast, and slight sweet malt. Overall, too syrupy - not enough true citrus (blackberry).
NEGATIVE	Bottle. Pours a very dark brown almost black color with a dark tan head that settles down to a thin head that collars around the glass. The aroma is dark chocolate, coffee, and slight bourbon. Medium mouthfeel. Roasty, coffee, dark chocolate, with a slight bourbon note but not really overly strong. Not bad, the body isn't as heavy as I would like for a beer like this. The bourbon is pretty minimal as well. Pretty easy drinking though. For a stout it is good but as a barrel aged stout it is lackluster.
POSITIVE	A. Poured from a 12oz. bottle into a pint glass. Copper in color with a bit of head that recedes to just around the edges. There is some lacing.  S. In the nose are malts, barley and roasted grain.  T. Starts off with a sweet malty note, definate roasted character comes through as well. Hops are herbal, tea like, and balance the beer quite well. Some caramel malt is noticed in the aftertaste.  M. Medium bodied, smooth, refreshing. Crisp. Highly carbonated.  D. A good session beer. Solid example of the style. Rates comparably to other Oktoberfests.
POSITIVE	Poured into a pint glass from a bottle.  Has a very obvious grapefruit nose. With some slightly different maltiness that I am going to have to attribute to the Rye. If you rub it in your palm and then smell it (little trick a friend taught me), it has a very obvious rye aroma.   Burps have a nice rye taste with a bit of grapefruit. lol ;)   Finish lasts a LONG time and has a nice rye flavor to it.   As it's warming the aromas are getting more intense (and more yummy). This is very drinkable, I could definitely drink lots of these, very flavorful/tasty but not like getting punched in the face. Just got a "mmmm that's tasty" out of me.   This definitely brings the thunder (to use a Gary Vaynerchukism).   Seriously (although it's kind of funny) this is probably one of the best burping beers ever, it tastes almost better to me when I burp then when I first drink it. Just for that I think it deserves a high taste and drinkability score.   As I drink that last few sips, when it had really warmed up this is really really tasty. This is an excellent beer.
POSITIVE	4.9%.  A: Clear golden yellow, pours with a nice white head, some retention, good lace.  S: Steelie, grassy & floral hops.  T: Steelie, grassy & floral hops, modest bitterness, hints of underlying caramel & bread.  M: Light to moderate body is smooth, with a relatively crisp finish.  D: Quite drinkable.
NEGATIVE	as far as beers go, this isnt what i was expecting. Perhaps i just havent had a lot of mead's in my life time. It was of a bright red color, almost kool-aid like, with a more carbonated look almost. and the bartender brought me in it a regular glass instead of the wine glass it was ment to be served in an effort to make my drink look less feminine i suppose. It smelled really good tho, almost too good, again kool-aid like, but just the same, it did smell good. This beer was a new "beer" experience for me as it wasnt very beer like at all but more wine like i would say. The taste of Raspberry was very strong, as i expected by the color and smell of it, very sweet also. I felt more comfortable sipping on this drink than taking larger drinks, as i more commonly do with other beer.
POSITIVE	pours out a light amber/orange and very clear with just a small amount of white suds. Smell is grapefruit and orange peel with and an aroma from some very nice hops. Taste is very dry grapefruit with orange and cherry. That is where the bitterness ends cause of the sweet aftertaste. Carmel sugars abound here. Mouthfeel is a little oily but not as much as a better IPA. Good session brew here. Founders has some gems and some turds, this is in the middle there somewhere.
POSITIVE	Poured from the tap at the St. Anthony Village Pub in Minneapolis into a tall tulip glass.  Appearance: Slightly hazy deep amber with a nice white foamy head that left a little lacing as it receded to a nice white cap.  Smell: Some subtle floral hops with a nice sweet malt behind it. Very inviting aroma.  Taste: A really well balanced flavor for an IPA. Some nice floral and citrus hops and bitterness up front, followed by very smooth and slightly sweet caramel malts. Finishes dry and crisp.  Mouth feel: Medium bodied with good carbonation.  Drinkablity: Oh yes, very easy to drink and great flavor. Easily a session beer. Will definitely order this one again, or pick some up at the store as a summer refresher.
NEGATIVE	A- Poured in Czech Pilsner glass short lived 1/2 finger head. Beer itself is dark gold and very clear. Medium-high carbonation.  S- Slightly dank scent, mildly sweet.  T- Reminds me of the honey sandwiches my mom made when I was a kid. Sweeter than it smells but pretty well balanced by the hops.  M- Medium body, a little sticky, well carbonated.  D- Fairly drinkable, but wouldn't be my first choice.
POSITIVE	Hazy pale gold color, thin whitish head, sparatic lacing. Aroma is nice and fairly hoppy, clean, sweet, citrusy, a bit juicy with some hop resin and floral notes. Taste is crisp and clean with a favorable fruity balance between the bready sweet malts and the dulled citrus of lemon flavors. Hops do their thing with some milding bitterness of slight resin, flowers and citrusy things. Feel is about medium, with a soothingly smooth slick carbonation and the bitterness is fully in check. A pretty good Pale, perfect session brew or poker night drinker. Thanks to trbeer for the many samples!
NEGATIVE	Had this beer on-tap at Founders the other day. Wow it sure is HOPPY. Not that nice flowery hoppy either, just piney. This thing is all sting. Luckily I was in dire need of a hop jolt so this beer was satisfying. There isn't much of a backbone to this beer just all hops, for that reason I marked it down in drinkability. It really is out of balance and isn't for the faint of heart. My tongue was gone after one pint. I was tasting the hops the rest of the day, not that that is a bad thing.
POSITIVE	Wow great imperial IPA. Pours a bright, hazy, golden orange with an off white 2 finger head. Medium lacing. The nose is incredible on this beer. Citrus and grapefruit hops dance through your nasal passage in a delightful way. The citrus and grapefruit are well balanced with a fruity sweetness. The finish is an oily mouth coating finish of long drawn out grapefruit tartness. I will seek this beer out in the future.
POSITIVE	This is one of the most sweetly floral saisons I've ever had. The first bottle I had of this, I wasn't able to review it, but now I'm at home. Poured into a big wine glass. Cloudy unfiltered gold with modest foam retention.   An amazing nose. Orange and a little spice, maybe even a little patchoul, lots of florals - lilac, lavender, slight undercurrent of mustiness.  Dry beer with good snap/crackle/pop. Rosewater, white pepper, clove, a little banana, hazelnut and a thick wheat backbone with a suggestion of sweet orange. Almost a saison/wit hybrid.   I think this is an excellent beer, but it's an expensive 12 oz.
NEGATIVE	This beer poured a golden copper color with a huge fluffy head. The smell is malty with a little bit of hops aroma. The taste is starts off fairly sweet with a little bit of a hops bite in the middle that gives way to more sweetness. The mouthfeel is pretty nice, although there was more carbonation than I expected. This is a very nice little beer, and I could imagine going through a sixpack or so sometime.
POSITIVE	12 oz bottle, poured into a Duvel tulip.  A deep reddish brown boddy is capped by a smallish tan head that soon reduces to a small island of foam in the middle of the glass, with a thin ring around the rim. A bit of lacing.  Sweet aromas of oak, restrained bourbon, baked apples and vanilla. The bourbon is more assertive in the mouth, but not at all overpowering. Plentiful sweetness of caramel malt, vanilla and oak. Maybe a hint of chocolate as well. Some roasted malt and a sort of grassy bitterness keep things in check. The finish is surprisingly dry, with a bit of warming alcohol. Mild bourbon/oak aftertaste.  Overall impression: Probably an nice candidate for cellaring, although the bourbon is perfectly integrated into the beer already. Very enjoyable sipper.
NEGATIVE	Reviewed on10/4/11  Clear amber colored, one finger white head, dissipates quickly but leaves nice lacing Strong resinous hop aromas and alcohol Sweet malt followed by strong resinous/pine hop bitterness, a little nutty as well Medium bodied, very bitter coates the mouth, and warms the pipes, leaves a strong soapy like aftertaste. Looks good and smells good, tastes pretty good but the alcohol is very in your face all the way through, love hops but this one leaves a bad aftertaste, not my favorite founders brew
NEGATIVE	Well hazed orange amber with a beautiful off white head that has tremendous retention and leaves dense cobwebs of lace.  Aroma is beech wood smoke with undertones of crisp wheat, banana, and citrus. Smoke is what this beer is all about.  A sip fills your palate with the sensation of chewing on a slab of freshly smoked back bacon. Intense hardwood smoke has soft underpinnings of slick wheat, banana, and even clove. The base beer is a fine hefeweizen, but all subtleties are brutalized by the thick, chewy smoke.   Perfect body for a hefe, a slick, wheaty texture is both creamy and slippery, with oily smoke molecules leading you on a charred, bacony finish.
POSITIVE	Dark amber in color, slight hop aroma on the nose....The body is medium to full...On the palate there is a nice assertive hop character, not too much hops at all though, tiny notes of citrus, well balanced...very clean and crisp brew. Ends with a nice dry, clean finish. A enjoyable APA....
POSITIVE	The colour is warm and deep red-brown, the liquid is clear. The beige compact head is two fingers high. Lots of thick lacing.   Fresh smoke and sweet malt dominates the smell. Some meaty roasted notes. Smoked ham and sausages.   As for the taste, if I remember right, the smoke is milder than in the bottled beer, and less of the forest fire notes. Some brown ale-like roasted flavours. Some sweetness, but very weak bitter flavours. There are some hops, but together with the smoke, they rather give sourness than bitterness. The aftertaste brings notes of smoked fish/ham. It is surprisingly short and leaves some salt in the finish.   The carbonation is medium to strong, the bubbles light. The liquid is dry.   OK, this is the Rauchbier others are measured by. Still I think it could gain from a little more hops and forest fire.
POSITIVE	First this little note. My bottle is labled Stoudts Winter Ale and I know it is the 2009-2010 year but what I am drinking does not seem to be an American Amber or red ale. Poured into a shaker pint this brew was very dark, almost black and starts out with a really thick head that slowly goes into a film. Laced really well with a spicy malty aroma. Sweet caramel taste and finishes with a citrusy taste. Enjoyable to drink.
POSITIVE	Pimmp sent me this on a recent trade, thanks man!  Served in a "unibroue maudite" glass. Pours murky redish dark brown. Brownish of white head, some lacing and decent low carbonation. Aroma of burnt caramel, scotish yeast esters and also a faint aroma of cocoa.  Flavor is a pronounced kettle caramelised malt, charred wood and harming alcohol. Very drinkable, but definately a sipper ale.  Wonderful wee heavy! Founders are now on my "got to get more of" list.
POSITIVE	Appearance- Pours a white head with scant lacing, beer is an orange amber with a slight haze.   Smell- Fresh piney and citrusy hops and a slight malt aroma.   Taste- A nice balance between a good malty backbone and a good dose of hops. Hops have a pronounced grapefruit flavor and hops continue on the palate.   Mouthfeel- Middling carbonation and a bit sticky in the mouth     Mouthfeel- Intensely hoppy, but balanced out so nicely with malts that drinkability is nicely increased.
POSITIVE	2011 KBS from a large "fish bowl" snifter served at 60* F  A- Beautiful black, brown head, sticks to the glass. The way a stout should look.   S- Smells good, but seems to be less boozy than last year. Still has a great smell of coffee, bourbon, and booze.   T- Taste is incredible, but seems to be lacking from the 2010 variety. It is flavorful, but doesn't have the bourbon flavor that I remember. It is a very good stout. One of the best. But each bottle I've had so far (10 total) each one tastes very different. The first few were very strong on bourbon, the next were strong on coffee, and the last few have seemed to be more balanced, but weaker in overall flavor. You do get it all though. Bourbon, chocolate, alcohol burn, with a very nice coffee finish.  M- Sticks to the tongue, and stays with you. And thats all the good flavors. I want a stout to stick, and this one does. however, it does feel a little thin when compared to it's appearance.   O- A top notch stout. If I had not tried an 09 BCBS, the batch 1 of the boulevard RIS, and GI Big John from this year, I probably would have rated this A+, but those stouts impressed me in overall quality and flavor, thereby raising the stout bar. From what I remember from last years KBS, it would have held it's own much better. I just feel that the 2011 batch is a little bit thinner.
POSITIVE	Poured into a tasting glass  A - Dark as a black hole and thick. Dark brown head with small tight bubbles. Leaves clear residue on sides of glass that is a warning of the alcohol content.  S - Grassy and citrusy hop aroma. Alcohol is evident in nose, especially as the beer warms. Firm coffee and chocolate malt aroma.  T - Strong chocolate and coffee with a hefty backing of grapefruit. Normally I don't like a strong American hop presence in a dark beer, but this beer has found a nice balance between the roast and the citrus. Slight mineral, chalky quality. Very firm bitterness which is keeping the slightly sweet finish well in check.  M - Thick, full bodied with medium to low carbonation which lends to a very smooth beer. Warming alcohol even from a few ounce sample.  O - When Hoppin' Frog decides to brew this beer again, I am definitely seeking it out again. However, I am a little torn on what to do with this beer. I think the alcohol could use a little age to mellow, but the hop flavor and aroma contribute a lot to this beer. This beer could be a little better if the alcohol was a little more blended with the rest of the flavors but the hop aroma and flavor was retained.
POSITIVE	12oz can poured into a pint glass  Pours a bright yellow with nice head, very little lacing. Smells slightly hoppy, mostly wet greens.  Taste is a tiny little bit of honey and a fair amount of hops, some floral. Nice bitter aftertaste.  Mouthfeel is light and effervescent. Pretty drinkable. Not as good as their IPA, I don't think.
POSITIVE	On-tap at Bryant Lake Bowl.  Appearance: Simply put, this is an opulant pour, from the tap it's obsidian with runnels of maghogany foam churning in the glass forming a cap of rich brown head. Striking, exceptional, and inviting.   Smell: Heady waves of midnight dark chocolate, roasted coffee, bourbon, vanilla, dark fruits and roasted malt roll forth in a tidal wave of flavor.  Taste: Dark chocolates, roasted malt and espresso perfectly balanced with hop lend a bitterness that just pricks the tongue before laying on what has to be one of the most grandiose displays of what a brewmaster can accomplish with a bourbon barrel aging process. Big & warming with notes of vanilla, dark cherry, chocolate. Toffee sweetness. Altogether perfectly balanced bitterness and bourbon elements make for a looong, warming finish.   Mouthfeel: Luxiourous texture and very coating. Carbonation supports the body and it's just about perfect.  Drinkability: Delicious from start to finish. I really don't care if it's 11-12% ABV. Bring it on.  Notes: As I understood it, the bar owner aged this vessel of KBS for an additional year before tapping it a couple days ago. I could be wrong.
POSITIVE	Growler from the BP; served in a snifter.  Pours a hazy caramel but settles to a much darker, nearly opaque molasses. Creamy, faint off-white head that clings to the snifter's sides and settles as a milky, bubble-filled sheet. Pindrop lacing with good strength.  Grapefruit and peach notes of sourness; hop resins abound with lots of bright pine. Mild touches of semi-rich caramel in the background. Whaffs of fresh bubblegum.  Burnt floral hops with an intense presence of pine and spruce. The hop character is juicy and oily. The tartness in aroma is nearly absent in the flavor, and is replaced by a slightly buttery, toasted maltiness. Earthy flavors and hints of caramel follow a rough, hop-intensified bitterness.  Almost full in body; creamy, smooth; yet filmy due to to the intense hop character. Very mellow despite some big flavors.  A dynamic and complex ale more reminiscent of a malty IPA. Smooth and unencumbered; thankfully, I chose a growler!
NEGATIVE	A- Reddish brown with a fair amount of haze. Head was creamy white but retention was low.  S- Sourness with darker roasted malt smell with some malt sweetness. I got excited by how interesting this smelled, and then...  T- Much less appealing than the smell, it starts with citric sourness, sweet caramel malt and is overpowered by a burnt malt flavor. The sour/burnt mix is very unappealing and I struggled to find some highlight to this flavor combination (and couldn't).  Mouthfeel- even carbonation with unfortunately light mouthfeel.  Overall, I get the impression that there was just a little bit too much black patent in the brew, giving an oppressively bitter finish that lingered unpleasantly long after every taste. Perhaps with more mid-level caramel malt and less burnt barley husks this would be a more pleasant beer.
POSITIVE	Amber body and white head with a little retention. Smells of ringwood fruit - where are the hops? Taste is pretty good. Mix of ringwood fruit, sweet malt and bit of grassy hops. Very drinkable, I'd also call this an amber or recommend it for the summer.
POSITIVE	On tap Dec 17 from notes:  A: Its' appearance is slippery and oily black. Good size tan head with moderate retention and excellent lacing.  S: The nose is potent to say the least. Some hops, oak, dark malt, maple, and a hint of booze. Raisins and coco appear as the beer warms.   T: It starts out with oak, vanilla, and a fruity/ester flavor I can't put my finger on. Very boozy and woody in a good way. There are a ton of interesting flavor notes going on. A symphony of sorts.  M: Slick and thick with moderate carbonation. The mouthfeel really adds to the overall effect of this beverage.   D: Great brew that I will seek out again. It is a bit too strong for more than 1 in a sitting, but delicious none the less.
POSITIVE	12oz bottle, received in a trade. Pours very dark brown with a tan head. Smells of chocolate, malt, caramel and a bit of vanilla. smooth flavor and quite tasty drinking. Has a nice thickness yet still an ease of drinkability. Very tasty beer that I'd would like to have available out there in the pacific northwest to enjoy on a regular occasion.
NEGATIVE	Thanks to FishGetter for grabbing me this brew. Served this brew cold, but waited to sample after it warmed a bit. Served in a snifter, from a brown twelve ounce bottle. Always excited to try a Founders release.  Appearance: Backwoods Bastard pours out a deep almost ruby brown color. A somewhat hard pour resulted in about a half inch of tan colored head. Head faded rather quickly, leaving very little lace behind on the glass. Not a bad looking brew.  Smell: Big bourbon aroma leads the nose, followed by some mellow oak. Touches of vanilla and some sweet toffee. Nice nose, quite bourbony.   Taste: Pretty sweet in my opinion. Bourbon seems more mellow than in the nose. Smooth and boozy. Nice buttery oak flavor. Faint vanilla and spice in the background. Slightly bready. Has an almost musty flavor that lingers in the finish. Hit you with a dry booziness that warms as it goes down.  Mouthfeel: Creamy, full bodied, thicker mouthfeel that is quite pleasing to the palate. Carbonation is low, but is perfect for this beer. Very smooth.  Drinkability: A somewhat tough drink in my opinion. Definitely a sipper. The strong bourbon and higher ABV hamper drinkability. Pretty good overall, but one glass is enough.
POSITIVE	*I like it and will not buy again*  app: golden starw hint o copper nice eggshell head good bubbles.  smell: flowers.. purple soft flowers.. hint o citrus and some grain.  taste: HUH! some toasty ALMOST brown tasting malts up front, then a nice wash of clean refreshing hops. then an almost butterscotch finish, yummy indeed.   mf: good and heavy for a pale ale a lil oily, i like it though, it feels like it has significance.  drinkable?: better be, its a damn pale ale, and yes .. it is. a small hint of acidic finish prevents me from putting up a 4.5
POSITIVE	Poured ye old brew into a pint glass for great justice.  A - Pours a beautiful golden copper, hazy thanks to the unfiltered status of the beer. Unfortunately, the 1-finger head vanished without much of a trace, leaving a small collection at the top of the beer to remind you of what once was. No lacing...  S - Surprisingly sweet at the first sniff, with a bitter, hop kick backing it up. Sort of like a pink grapefruit on the scent. Very subtle balancing, and an attractive nose for sure, with a little twist of spruce.  T - Mmm, friendly combination. Heavy citrus tones, like the grapefruit in the nose, come alive here, as does the hop combination. Very clean tasting, so to speak, without any heavy bitterness detracting from the flavors. Sure, more bitter as it warms, but the citrus is enhanced as well. Awesome job.  M - Smooth, creamy body with a crisp finish. Super-refreshing, and would make for a great summer drink (note to self).  D - For an IPA? About as good as it gets. Founders really nailed the style with this one. Great first experience with the company!  Overall/notes: Hey, first Founders brew! Not at all disappointed by this one. I'm surprised at how smooth this IPA turned out to be. Normally, I associate the style with a harsh, bitter kick, but this one went in another direction. Well worth purchase, will drink again.
POSITIVE	A - Black color with a brown head and no lacing at all  S - Dry coffee malt nose with lots of Bourbon  T - Great dry malt up front then hints of the whiskey throughout just a great way to approach the two flavors not letting one dominate but mingle nicely the hints are powerful but not distracting.  M - Very creamy  D - Great.
NEGATIVE	Poured into a Stone Old Guardian glass.  Pretty much black with hints of amber on the edges. A one finger beige head that dies down to a layer of foam on top.  Smells of caramel and toffee. Hint of chocolate. A hint of resinous hops too.  Tastes of chocolate, toffee, raisins, a touch of licorice, and some tropical fruity hops. A resinous and smokey finish.  Mouthfeel is sweet, lots of residual sugars balanced out by a ton of bitter hops. Nice carbonation. Some spice from the hops.  Really intense flavors on this one. Tons of sweetness/bitterness and spice. It would be hard to have more than one.
POSITIVE	Presentation: 500 ml bottle, with a resealable cap.  This bottle of Bernard was yet another gift from a friend visiting the Czech Republic. After popping off the top, champagne style, the beer poured a frothy, cloudy, light amber color with a huge head. A somewhat strange foam was left after a few minutes, but the active carbonation highlighted the nice yeasty suspension. A light, sweet malt smell greeted the nose, along with some citrus elements. Above average smell for a pilsner. The hops mark their presence a bit more in the taste. The same light malt foundation remains, but a crisp bitterness creeps in after some time. A sharp but delicate taste lingers, not overpowering but subtly present between sips. For all its good qualities, the champagne appearance comes up thin in the mouthfeel. I hoped to avoid a club soda feel, but the Bernard body is a little light, despite the delicate character or taste. Nonetheless, the Bernard Celebration Lager was tasty and very easy to drink. I can easily imagine myself in a Czech pub having several of these, even if it isn't the best Bohemian lager/pilsner out there.
NEGATIVE	Pours a thick, frothy head to it, traditional of ones that are common to IPA's.   Color is light yellow, similar to a lager or common IPA.   Scent is heavy on hops, as one would expect a Double IPA, especially with the Founders Brand to it.   Taste is also heavy on hops; it almost feels like what the beer was made for. As Double IPA's go, its mouthful and consistency are everything what you'd expect for a beer of its caliber.   In terms of drinkability, this beer is a true monster. It's a hop monster that takes no prisoners. In that regard, those that can take on the hop can really get to this beer.
NEGATIVE	Just about to open the bottle and see what lurks inside. I've been waiting to try this one as well as several of the other Rauchbiers from the brewery. That being said, here goes.  Look: Beautiful dark amber and ruby brown in color, with a thick creamy billowy head. Simply beautiful  Smell: Right off the bat it exhibits a smoked meat and wood aroma (particularly sausage, but also some ribs and steak) with a lurking presence or roasted malt caramel and brown sugar, followed by freshly baked bread and a slightly nutty characteristic. Wonderful smell overall.  Taste: The nose doesn't lie, right off the bat I get the flavor of spicy smoked German sausage, charred ribs, and beef jerky. It also exhibits a brown sugar quality that reminds me of barbecue sauce and exhibits a slight roasted bitterness character that reminds me of coffee as well as the flavor or char. Good overall, not as good as I expected but still quite tasty.  Feel: Smooth with a tingly feeling on the tongue at first that leads into a slightly thick creamy sensation. Quite pleasing to say the least.  Drinkability: This thing really gives you a wallop, I've had one and I'm already done I don't need anything else after this.  Final notes, Quite a good beer overall. Looks and smells wonderful and is very potent. Tastes pretty good, and feels very good, but one of these will be more than enough.
POSITIVE	A- Opaque orange body with a small white head and good lacing  S- Hoppy, but not overly so, decently fragrant  T- Citrussy hops, spices, caramel malt middle and sweet finish, a fun ride  M- Light-bodied, good average level of carbonation  D- Very easy to drink and the complex taste makes it great to return to
POSITIVE	Man, now this is what I am talking about!  This beer is like chocolate milk. Just great. The drinkability is wonderful, there is a nice hint of maple syrup. A light roastiness from the grains. It all just comes together so well. I want to write more, but the genius of this beer is that it is so simple. When you've done everything right, there isn't much to say, you know? Delicious malt, lots of chocolate, a nice sweetness, but not too much on any of those account. Just a great drinking beer. After every sip I want another, but it is complex enough to savor. I could drink the bomber over the course of an entire afternoon or I could drink it in five minutes. That is high praise indeed!
POSITIVE	So the black and tans I've had were made with Guinness or some porter and Bass Ale. The clear distinction between the two made this beer stand out. Now the mixing of the two is interesting, but I still like the separate levels with black on top and tan down below. Oh well....  Pours a dark ruby almost black topped with a nice, medium-dense, off-tan head.   Yup, quite a blend of IPA and Stout here in the aroma. Dark malts and chocolate, some coffee and toffee. Fights hard with the pine, wet grass aromas from the hops. This reminds me of a campfire in mid-summer roasting some s'mores...without the smoke.  And the taste follows the nose. Roasted malt and slightly burnt caramel are on one side and the pine, earth and some mild citrus are on the other in battle for flavor dominance. In the end, none of them win and the balance is quite nice.   Although, the strong bite at the finish pretty much wipes out any residual roasty malt-ness. Overall a very nice beer. Perhaps this is a black IPA?
POSITIVE	a: darkish caramel. head disappears in mere seconds ::poof::  s: hops, sweet caramel malts. nice aroma this  t: great rye flavor. nice blend of piney hops and caramel malts but the rye kicks in at the end and is sublime.   m: medium body, medium carbonation.   o: Wow, another great beer from Founders. I believe this is my first rye beer and I imagine it will be tough to beat as the benchmark for the style. Highly recommended.
POSITIVE	A - A 1/2 inch of white head falls to a thin ring. Deep yellow to amber orange colored beer underneath.  S - Vibrant aroma of honey, molasses, nutmeg and faint vanilla. The pumpkin character is strong, but a bit bland, like bread dough, and could be toned down a bit.  T - Sweet caramel malt flavor and banana undertones give way to a mild cinnamon and bready pumpkin.  M - Medium bodied with little carbonation. Finishes clean and balanced between dry and sweet.  O - A beer first and a spiced beer second, as a pumpkin ale should be.
POSITIVE	Pours black, opaque, with a small, thick, dark brown head.  Scent of juicy dark fruit, sweet, dry hops, roasted malts, oatmeal, chocolate, and a hint of spicy alcohol. It is hoppy, but not to the extent of Night Stalker or Darkness.  Taste of roasted malts, charred oak, dry bitter hops, ash, dark fruit, oatmeal, and chocolate. Finishes with bitter coffee and hops, one of the most bitter Imperial Stouts I have ever had. While it may not be as hoppy as Night Stalker or Darkness, it certainly is more bitter.  Mouthfeel is heavy bodied and oily, but a little bit thin from the low carbonation.
POSITIVE	Sampled on draft.  Pours a cloudy golden-orange color with a decently formed white head.  The jalapeno really comes out on the aroma. Smells very nice and I have to give them credit here because a lot of pepper beers fail at that.  The flavor has a pale malt base that gives way to a solid jalapeno punch. Very fresh-tasting.  Smooth and creamy on the mouthfeel with medium-light body.  This is a subtle but very well-done beer overall. Doesn't try to do too much, and I respect that. Very drinkable pepper session beer.
NEGATIVE	Devil Dancer pours a clear, deep, rosey orange color with the barest amount of off-white bubbles melting quickly away.  The aroma is powerful and sweet caramel and toffee smelling malts backed by heavy, sugary, citric hops and brandy like alcohol.  Full and thick body with a stout-like syrupy smoothness to it. The flavor has a heavy and sweet maltiness to it. Caramel, toffee, and brown sugar all push against each other, but the power of the citrus hops pushes pushes back with equal force, balancing out the brew. Deep orange and grapefruit sweetness enter and bring a riney bitterness that sticks through the finish along with some pleasant, warming, alcohol.  Definitely strong and a sipper, but a refined and soothing one that can be enjoyed and appreciated with each sip.
POSITIVE	I poured from a 12 ounce bottle into my SA pint glass. It pours thick like motor oil, is jet black and has a minimal tan head, with a bit of lacing. The aroma of strong brewed coffee and a hint of chocolate. The flavor profile consist of coffee and chocalate and is pleasantly bitter. This full bodied brew has higher carbonation than I am used to in a RIS, but it is a good thing. This stout is a very good sipper.  After ageing for a year the flavors really mellow out. There is a lot more dark fruit, and more sweetness. I highly recomend aging this one.
NEGATIVE	I was just really let down by my last review...I'm hoping this makes up for it...  Nice enough looking beer. Not quite brown, more of a brown-red. Pours a decent off-white head. Cloudy but not opaque.   Uh-oh. I don't know that corn-on-the-cob is a good smell for a beer to have, but this one is loaded with it. Some sweet roasted corn and a bit of yeast. Mostly corn.   Damn. This could be my first drain pour. Tastes like rotten corn-on-the-cob. Actually, it tastes exactly like a scratch-and-sniff corn-on-the-cob sticker I remember from when I was five or six years old. Yuck. I can't taste anything else under the corn nastiness.   Medium bodied with medium carbonation. I only wish this average mouthfeel was supporting an average taste.   Doesn't look that bad or feel too bad but the taste is just horrible. I've tried this brewery's Recompense on the advise of a friend and was also very disappointed. Mort De Rire means "dying of laughter." Maybe that's what Brasseurs Et Freres are doing knowing that people are actually buying this stuff.   (My girlfriend thinks all beer tastes the same so I've passed it over to her. Otherwise this would have litterally been poured down the drain. I can't believe she doesn't know the difference between this and Peche Mortel...that doesn't make sense.)
NEGATIVE	Been waiting to try this for a while, so I figured tonight is as good of a night as any. I've been really interested in old ales lately, so hopefully this one will live up to the rest of the Founders line. Poured from the bottle into a pint glass.  Appearance: Pours a deep brown with a ton of amber highlights pouring through; with a really hard pour I manged to get a near 1 finger head out of it that fades almost immediately to a thin and uneven skim with a thick ring around the edge of the surface; body is hazy and looks thick and viscous and there is some sediment floating throughout;  Smell: Deep, rich caramel and burnt sugary maltiness and strong presence of alcohol  Taste: Wow... Very nice -- sweet caramel and burnt sugary malts just like in the nose and a very potent presence of alcohol that is blended quite well with the strong malty flavors; a hint of spiciness and a milt hoppy bitterness sneaks in as well; as it warms a bit I feel like I'm picking up on some oak/vanilla as well -- is this aged in a barrel to any degree?   Mouthfeel: Very viscous and chewy; leaves a very thick coating all over the palate; mouth is warm and tingly from the higher ABV, as is the throat and stomach - a very potent beer.   Drinkability: Well, this is a sipper. Big and bold flavors and bigger alcohol would prevent this from being something that's especially drinkable. A great tasting offering though, doesn't quite rank up there with the Old Stock in my estimation, but still pretty damn good.
POSITIVE	A - pours with two fingers of tan foam on top of an opaque, black body. The head settles slowly and leaves moderate lace.  S - a strongly roasty aroma with coffee and a bit of chocolate.  T - smoky coffee and some dark chocolate up front. A little bit of spice comes out in the middle with notes of chicory and licorice. Finishes with lots of coffee and moderate malt bitterness.  M - a fairly thick body, moderate carbonation, and a balanced finish.  D - nicely done, this is a bit on the thick side for a porter, but very well balanced and flavorful.
POSITIVE	no freshness date  a: Pours a hazy dark orangeish amber with thick frothy head that slowly settles leaving cream colored lacing clinging to the side of my glass.  s: The hops give off some strong grapefruit aromas as well as the typical herbal notes. Finally, there is a slight spicy character that I assume is due to the rye.  t: Sweet malt and citrusy hops contribute to an IPAish taste, but with an interesting twist to it that I assume is do to the rye.  m: Very smooth with a chalky, dry finish. Has a thick, creamy texture.  d: Its different from the other beers I've had, I don't know if its the rye or something else. Certainly unique and I like it. I only have one bottle, but if I had more, I would definitely try another and try to get a better grasp of its flavor and aroma which are both similar to an ipa, but a little different. I wouldn't call it a session beer, but I wouldn't shy away from seconds either.
POSITIVE	Nice chestnut brown/coppery color. Low aroma-slight smokey quality. Trace of a caramel/nutty note. Malty flavor with a nice, moderate level of smoke. Touch of hop bitterness to go with it. Good body for a maerzen. Very drinkable beer. My German friend tries to scare me off of the smoke beers as he hates them. I find this quite enjoyable.
POSITIVE	a wonderful pour with a nice foam. tight and bubbly. golden with a tint of green. a mild nose of yeasty apple pollen. not very hop aromatic. a very nice bitter that blends unaggressively with the honey sweet. a nice pollen and a nice earth quality. dry but not soapy. a mild sweet. wonderfully refreshing. a pilsner that is particularly twit wood earth and honey pollen sweet.
POSITIVE	pours a cloudy dark brown with a very small beige head that quickly fades to the beer with very little lace. smell is much better fruity with roasted malts, coffee, figs, raisins, hint of alcohol. taste is very sweet and complex with all of the above and with some caramel and a bitter tea that lingers after the finish. mouthfeel is light to medium but carbonation is weak. alcohol is a little prohibitive otherwise nice tasting beer.
NEGATIVE	Poured into a snifter.  3.0 A: Clear light amber color. A little over one finger of creamy off-white head that falls fairly quickly and just leaves small touches of lacing. Unimpressive head for a DIPA.  3.5 S: Interesting, but not overly appealing. Foremost, this smells like a skunk. No, it doesn't smell skunked, but rather the animal. It's not necessarily that bad though (I like the smell of skunks on occasion). Underneath there are tropical fruits with heavy amounts of orange followed by peach. Malts are lightly bready with some caramel. Alcohol is very well hidden.  2.5 T: My god the hops. I can't believe I'm typing this, but there is too much hop flavor in this. This is overly resiny and I feel like I'm biting into a grapefruit (note that I didn't say drinking grapefruit juice). Tons of pine, surprisingly little tropical fruit overall, but still lots of orange. There's lots of sweetness at the beginning stemming from both the hops and the malts, the middle offers caramel and bready malts, and the finish is a bitterness that lingers. Alcohol is lightly warming throughout, but not very boozy.  3.0 M: Heavy body. A good bit chewier than I care for. Good moderate carbonation. The booze is kept in check, but the hops aren't.  2.5 D: The back and forth of the sweet and bitter is a bit too much for me. They should have focussed on a few flavors instead of trying to jam this beer full of all of them.
POSITIVE	Appearance: The beer is a really dark garnet with initially a large 1/2" head of off white bubbles that faded pretty quickly. The beer is really clear and has a decent amount of lacing. Even after the head falls, there is a good bit of bubbles sitting on top of the beer.  Aroma: There is a whole lot of dried fruit in this beer. I get plums and black cherries in particular as well as a good bit of toasty notes. There are no esters or fermentation by-products in here along with a subtle spiciness in here.  Taste: The flavor follows the aroma pretty closely, but the beer showcases the toasty notes well. There is a good bit of caramel sweetness in here that lingers long into the finish. There is no hops to speak of, and some of the balance is provided by the dark grains as much as from any hops. There is a little bit of minerals noticeable in the finish. The dark malts give it some dryness in the finish. There is plenty of malt and the esters are a bigger part of the complimentary flavors than any hops.  Opinion: This beer is pretty good and has a deep depth of flavor and is really deceptively drinkeable for being such a strong beer. The fruity notes compliment the whole ensemble, and this ends up being really refreshing...if it weren't for the 8+% alcohol. This beer is bordering on a dark lager, but the fruitiness sets it apart from that category. Either way, I would definitely drink this beer again if given the opportunity.
POSITIVE	A: black. entirely opaque. i actually see my reflection in the glass when holding this beer up. beautiful dark mocha creamy head.  S: you know when you grab the spent coffee grounds from the maker when you are all done in the morning? literally smelled exactly like that when I opened the bottle. but seriously, rich, rich, rich roasted coffee. picking up on some of the lactose as well. it smells thick.  T: first sip starts and finishes with acidic coffee. lingers thick roast on the palate. coats your entire mouth. lactose reminds me of the last sip of milk after eating a bowl of cheerios. cant taste the alcohol in a solid 8.3% abv? im impressed.  M: smooth and suede. creamy carbonation that is spot on for the style. big full-bodied beer on point.  D: see how many reviews this beer has. go buy a bottle dummy.
POSITIVE	Cracked one of these open on a lazy Sunday.  Pours a beautiful copper color with little head and only some lacing.  Smell is incredibly hoppy. Not as much citrus as I was expecting. A little bit of fruit.  One of the hoppier beers that I've had in a while. Hops come up and punch you in the face and hang around with a bitter aftertaste. Some malt presence back up the beer.  Overall, a decent IPA and I'm glad I got to try it, but there are better, more balanced IPA's available.
POSITIVE	Appearance: nice mellow copper. Slight off white head. Smell: sweet malt and bright fruit. Very pleasant. Taste: more of the same. Oh that's tasty.  Mouth fell: full and creamy. Overall: hoppin frog is new round these parts and this is a pleasant surprise.
NEGATIVE	Appearance - Pours a pale golden color with about a finger of quickly dissipating head that leaves little lacing on the edges of the glass.  Smell - Light hops, grainy malts, breadyness.  Taste - Taste is similar to the nose with a hint of caramel/honey. Nothing really stands out to me as special, but then again what do you expect with the description on the side of this.  Mouthfeel - Light bodied, prickly carbonation.  Drinkability - Quite drinkable to be honest, however as someone else stated, might as well buy some PBR's rather than spend money on this.
POSITIVE	I still chuckle at 'Big Fellow' Served on draught @ Beer Run in Charlottesville... from backlog:  A: Pitch black with a short head, but that is mostly attributed to the draft pour being a little heavy handed... It's basically beer to the brim. Some nice stickiness is left behind, though.   S: A wonderful medley of woods, strong bourbon scents, vanilla and toffee, some hints of maple.   T + M: Bourbon, strong on the forefront without the harsh heat that could be attributed to the alcohol. A smooth and creamy vanilla bean and a full bodied oakiness. Some nice, roasted notes. Quite a delicious beer and amazingly smooth and rich.   D: I have trouble believing the ABV of this one, though I feel it quite quickly. A nice tasting, smooth beer. A gentle sipper with good company.
NEGATIVE	Pours a clear, dark copper with minimal cream colored head.  Aroma consists only of grapefruit.  Flavor is very tangy with grapefruit. There is a little bit of caramel smoothness and slickness, but it's quite buried in the piney hop bitterness that follows. This also reminds me of a barley wine. Very sweet with that cherry alcohol bite.  A bit fizzy, well carbonated, a little sticky & sweet.  Drinkable? Not bad for its high ABV. Not bad at all, actually. However, a bit too sweet and definitely too bitter for my liking. If there had simply been some other flavor to hang on to and enjoy besides grapefruit & pine hops, it would be a different story.
NEGATIVE	12oz bottle (BB 3/23/10) from brewery into pint glass.  Poured a deep copper color with excellent clarity. Small head with a little lacing. Strong nose from fresh german hops backed by a bready malt aroma. Has a sweet taste of caramel and honey with a suprisingly milder than expected hop flavor. Finishes quite bitter for a dopplebock though. Mouthfeel is a little slick for style. Not a bad beer but not what I like in a dopplebock.
NEGATIVE	Appearance - Poured a deep, dark red. It was fairly cloudy with a small head. The head retention and lacing were quite low.   Smell - Lots of maltiness in the smell. There was also a lot of caramel and dark fruits, with a slight graininess. The alcohol hit the nose as it warmed a little in the glass.  Mouthfeel - Big, heavy, almost syrupy beer. Very little carbonation. It was very warming due to the alcohol and the huge body! Not the most drinkable beer I have ever had, but this would be a good night cap.  Taste - Much like the smell, a huge amount of maltiness was the first thing I tasted. It has a whole bunch of thick sweetness. There was also quite a bit of the dark fruit character. It was somewhat boozey because of the high alcohol and the scotch flavor (albeit mild, especially considering it's a "scotch" ale). There was some light citrus, floral, and even cedar hop flavors in this beer, but all were very mild.   Overall, not my favorite beer from Founders, but it is a very complex beer that I could see myself drinking every now and then. Definitely at least worth a taste!
POSITIVE	The last beer in my Founders binge for now. Poured into a Samuel Smiths pint glass.  A- Tiny 1/2 finger of beige, wet sand head that dissapates immediately. Against the light the beer is a glowing dark brown. Reminds me of a very rich dark chocolate.  S- The rich chocolate look pops into the nose too. Dark roast coffee, with equally roasted malts tell me this is my kind of porter. Even though only 45 IBU's I can feel the hops presence.   T- This porter is delicious. Initial taste is the roasted malt profile. That flavor starts small and gets progressively stronger on the taste buds, once peaking it transitions into dark coffee. The hops I mentioned in the nose make this a bitter cup of jo, and a good one. The flavor ends on a rich chocolate and a lingering caramel flavor that leaves me smacking the back of my mouth with my tongue.  M- Very milky and soft in the mouth. A medium level body in the mouth. After drinking this down my mouth feels like I've drank something a lot thicker though. Carbonation is ok, would like a little more. Perhaps I mishandled this bottle by mistake.  O- I thought this was an absolutely delicious porter. For me, the taste is up there with the Edmund Fitz porter, maybe even better. I think my bottle turned out a little flat though. I would love to find this on tap somewhere to remedy that. Even though I beleive Founders sell their beers in 4 packs, I could drink a sixer of this with no problem.
NEGATIVE	09/04/10- Had this one on-tap at the Founder's brewpub. A: Dark brown with mahogany hues, it has a slow developing tan-cream head that settles to a big bubbly ring. S: Nice green hops, piney, earthy like old wood, sweet oats, stout characteristics with molasses sweetness. T: Heavily hopped creamy stout (molasses and raisins) and a lingering toast with nice piney hops. Rum and caramel come through. M: Sticky but not overly syrupy, foamy with a slow carbonation. D: Only OK. 8 oz is enough.
NEGATIVE	Sort of caramel in color but not dark or thick-you could see through it. At first whiff I though I smelled something musty like wet grass. Swirling the drink around a bit in the glass that scent completely disappeared and the light aroma's of chocolate, homemade jam and I'm thinking a hint of bourbon too. Smell head that went away really fast. No retention, no lacing. One the lips you can feel a little bit of a tart cherry bite as well as a chalky chocolate thing. It's the same in the mouth and on the tongue with the chocolate taking the lead and the cherry providing a nice follow up. The cherry stays on the back of the tongue when swallowed with the chocalate flavor hanging around the roof of the mouth.
POSITIVE	From chicken scratch during tasting at bier baron (brick cellar) in DC.   A: standard dark chestnut brown. Excellent clarity. Cream foam covers surface and sides.   S: cocoa, hazelnut, classic porter malts. Really well done here.   T: flavors remind me of my beloved black butte porter from deschutes. This is maybe a hair more dry.   M: creamy, full bodied, with low carb. Slick finish.   O: if I moved from deschutes territory, this an Edmund fitz would be my go tos for porter.
NEGATIVE	Pours a nice tan head and a black body.The head fades to a nice ring with a patch in the center of my snifter.  Nice fruit in the nose.Some hops.  Nice roasted tastes and awesome bitterness at the end of the taste.Both of the tastes are fighting for dominance.  Nice mouthful,very slick and smooth,very velvety.  Not a bad beer at all.Not my favorite IMPY stout but a beer I wouldnt turn down.
POSITIVE	fat dog stout has an ebony appearence with a nice chestnut head that retains well through the pint. nice lacing. smell is like french roast coffee with toffee and caramel undertones. taste is slightly sweet with just a slight hop twang. coffee-chocolate malts dominate the taste. medium carbonation for the style. mouthfeel is hearty and heavy. drinkability is good for a few, but i could not drink this all night simply becuase it is so heavy and filling. great to kick off a good session.
NEGATIVE	Poured into a snifter on 3/29/10 upon returning from the Vampire Weekend concert  Hop Dam is a bold copper color, dense & only slightly cloudy. Around the edges are burnt sunburst highlights. The first pour was rather tame so as not to disturb the settled yeast. Even still, two fingers of foam was manifest with ease. After several minutes the head has thinned to a decently large swath of bubbles. Retention is thin but it lasts until the end. Lacing is very good at the start but gets thin & spotty by the end. Lacing is much better on the second pour.  It's densely hoppy & unabashedly so. I can say there are notes of pine & notes of the usual citrus suspects. I can say there are a lot of said notes. I can even say there are some floral hints. All of these would be as true as they would be surprising, considering the nature of this hop monster. Indeed, the aroma is awash in an intense hoppiness. What of the malts, then? I reckon they are there, somewhere. Incidentally, while there are overtones of solvent, they aren't as pronounced as I would expect based on a few other Hoppin' Frog IPAs (though as it warms, the solvent becomes more apparent).  This beer is viciously dry & scathingly bitter. The extent of these attributes is not apparent until after each swig. After the beer has gone, the dryness seems to create a vacuum of sorts with the only thing to fill it being residual bitterness. All told, piney bitterness - sharp & unrelenting - is the most appreciable characteristic. Lemon & grapefruit undercurrents offer spiciness but the citric qualities are pushed to the peripheries. I was actually hoping for more citrus juiciness & floral aspects to be featured which would round out the otherwise overly brash pine tar attack. Alas, this is not the case. As with the nose, malts don't stand a chance.   Technically medium-bodied, Hop Dam, in terms of perception, is essentially full-bodied. At the very least it's as dense a beer as the term "medium" can handle. Likely this is due to the sheer amount of pine tar-like resin. Interestingly enough there isn't much pronounced grittiness. I don't believe I have had a beer with so much resin but so little grittiness. Carbonation isn't too vigorous; while just enough, it stays out of the way. As mentioned above, there is a long lingering bitterness on the finish. Alcohol heat isn't particularly noticeable but the overall effect is definitely warming.  One bomber is all I can manage. All things held equal, drinkability isn't too bad, but it isn't great by any means. I can't fault it too much since this is a "Triple IPA" with indeterminably "high IBUs." While I have no regrets, this isn't an IPA (triple or otherwise) I would consider buying again. Maybe if I saw it during happy hour at Bodega - maybe. Hop Dam is borderline palate abuse. Better call HR, Hoppin' Frog took this one too far.
POSITIVE	12 oz. brown long neck bottle with a &#8220;Best if consumed before date marked&#8221; freshness date on the back label.   Appearance: Hazy dusty golden colour, thin lacing has a decent retention.  Smell: Soft husky grain with a powdery yeast, some sweetness from the malt and soft floral notes from the hops show up in the aroma.  Taste & Mouthfeel: Smoothness is impeccable within the moderate body, big doughy biscuity malt flavour is the showcase of this brew. Touch of yeast throughout. Hops give a juicy wet kiss of mild citrus, flower water and a mild sting of bitterness. Finishes a bit dry with a biscuity grain and floral hop in tow.  Notes: They stated this is a session brew, they were right. Minus the extra yeast flavour this is a good brew and something I&#8217;d drink all night.
POSITIVE	I think Ive had about 15-20 tulips of this stuff so far this summer (2005). Perfect appearance, dark mahogany brown with deep chestnut-ruby highlights, big stickyish medium-tan head is well-retained and there is plenty of spotty lacing about. Aroma of fruity, bitter hops (from the Red God) with that sticky sweet, black cherry-like fruitiness from the sour ale and a delicious earthy, semi-bitter chocolate and molasses note from the bourbon barrel porter. The flavor is similar to the aroma, with light hops acidity throughout and a big moderately tart, moderately sweet cherry flavor that dosent fade, to me, so much as does your palate get used to the flavor (actually I guess thats the same as fading). Then you really start to notice the bourbon, only its very well-done and sort of mixes in with the chocolate and caramel. Its got the hops bitterness for the hophead in your family, the barrel aging for the, um, barrelaginghead in your family, and the sweet, sticky caramel and toffee with roasted bitterness for the stout/porter lover. Though the cerise cassee was nowhere near as tart as I would have liked it to be and the cherries were a little bit too sweet and sticky, it works better here, with the sweetness being offset better by the other elements. The mouthfeel is divine, with tiny bubbles tingling your mouth everywhere. Silky, milk-chocolatey texture, with some oiliness from the cherries and hops. The porter really emerges as it warms, and you always get a kick of lightly tart cherries on the end. Awesome job, Will is a masterful blender. I wish this beer would get more exposure, its odd that no one really talks about this beer here in Boston. Oh well, Im content to just keep sippin it. (Wish they wouldnt serve it so cold to start, though). Acid and dry yeastiness really bulid on the palate, but I seem to be able to drink 3 or so of these at a time without really being bothered. Sort of a palate killer though, I wouldnt go reviewing another beer after this one. Severely unfiltered, feels grainy at times, and that, I think, is why I like it the most.
NEGATIVE	Iced tea with a large splash of orange juice. There's a generous amount of carbonation that's no help to the rather pathetic looking head. The foam is light beige in color, large-bubbled, soft and featureless. In other words, it looks like what one might see on a glass of soda pop. By the final pour, the beer becomes a much more attractive murky tawny.  Given the name, how is it possible that Blackberry Scottish-Style Ale doesn't smell like either blackberries or a Scottish ale? I can appreciate faint whiffs of caramel malt and very little else.  Things improve somewhat on the palate, but then only one direction was possible with such a lackluster nose. Believe it or not, I can appreciate what O'Fallon was trying to do with this beer. I taste blackberry essence (more artificial blackberry extract than the actual fruit) and the sketchy outlines of a wannabe Scottish ale. It still isn't great, though, and I question whether the target was worth aiming at.  The beer is unimpressively caramel malted. That flavor is quickly overcome by blackberry, which dominates through the finish. At this point in the bottle, I can appreciate little or nothing that is Scottish ale-like. I have a sneaking suspicion that my initial impressions along those lines were due to the power of suggestion.  The mouthfeel is closer to light than to medium. It also feels large-bubbled fizzy at the start of each mouthful and nearly flat on the swallow.  Even though Blackberry Scottish-Style Ale is only my third O'Fallon offering, I'm beginning to wonder if Smoked Porter isn't far and away their best beer. Having said that, I applaud the brewery's willingness to do something different. If done right, this could have been a pretty interesting beer. Unfortunately, it wasn't and it isn't.
POSITIVE	Got via trade back in the summer. The night before Christmas Eve thought I'd treat myself.  A-Black with a little little tan head that fades quickly but sticks to the glass  S-Coffee and a hint of bourbon  T-Coffee, lots of chocolate and some bourbon. Not nearly as much bourbon as expected but a very nice balance.  M-Smooth, nice low carbonation.   D-Way too drinkable! Not as much bouron as I was expecting. Could it have faded with the months in the cellar? Probably not.  A good beer and would like another, but probably won't seek it out via trades. The chocolate is very heavy but is balanced out nicely with the bourbon.
NEGATIVE	Citrus hoppy aroma. Grapefruit colour with a good head. Very drinkable citrus all of orange-lemon and grapefruit, slightly bitter-pucker aftertaste. Good balance, with sugar,a bit sticky and satisfying finish. Fresh.Appropriate carbonation.    A good iPA, thanks Aofoxxy.
POSITIVE	Pours a hazy, yellow color. 1/4 inch head of a white color. Decent retention and good lacing. Smells of slight sweet malt and slight yeast. Fits the style of an American Pale Wheat Ale. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with an average carbonation level. Tastes of wheat, yeast, slight sweet malt, and a hint of hop. Overall, a drinkable beer, smooth mouth feel, and much better than the previous reviews give it credit. I'm assuming the brew has changed in the past couple of years.
POSITIVE	12 oz bottle poured into a wine glass  Appearance: Clear, golden orange beer with towering, small bubbled, eggshell head. It surmises about 2" total. Not many bubbles come from the bottom of the brew. A lot of lacing is left behind  Smell: Hop oil and pine needles. Some strawbeery and honeysuckle. Not too complex here.  Taste: Surprisingly malty at first. This beer shows balance. Followed by piney hops and floral undertones. The finish is laden with bitterness and lasts quite awhile. As I drink on i noticed that the finish is superb, with some woodiness and a nice drying effect.  Mouthfeel: Definitely quenching, slick and easy to drink. The bittering dry hops keep you wanting (and drinking) more. Little carbonation. Alcohol is barely noticable.   Drinkability: Great. This is a serious summer quencher. I could easily drink a bunch of this stuff. Definitely worth seeking out again. Cheers!
POSITIVE	Hoppin' Frog Frog's Hollow Double Pumpkin  Clouded and carbonated, bright orange coloration, slim head, soon gone.  Spice up front, cinnamon aplenty. Maybe nutmeg or clove, but the heat says cinnamon. (Looking at the label, allspice and ginger, too.)  Sweet pumpkin meat meets sweet malt, nice and smooth, with spices along for the ride. Brisk carbonation up front, yummy pumpkin, getting mellow in the end. Hardly any hops at all, but that's not surprising, for the style. Tasty stuff, lots of pumpkin flavor, full-bodied, hearty.  I like this.
NEGATIVE	It is quite a happy day indeed; Terminal Gravity Brewing (of Enterprise Oregon) has finally got a bottling line. There are many (myself included) that think that TG makes the finest IPA in the state of Oregon. I am now happy to spread the TG word to the rest of the US. Sure there are more bitter beers and there are stronger IPAs out there but none seems to bring it all together quite as well as TG.    YUUUMMM, You all know what I'm talking about. That hazy copper orange color, tight but not overly large head, floral citrus hop aroma and that light malty / fruity flavor that quickly gets overwhelmed by the wonderfully aggressive hop bitterness.   If youre a hophead I suggest buying more than one bottle. If you only get one you will be heart broken that you have to wait another shipping cycle for more.
POSITIVE	From a 500ml can, freshness date stamped on the bottom. This is a bit smoother than it's bottled brethren, the nose and taste is not as bold, but even this milder version is fantastic. Plus there is no worry of any skunkiness from the bottles when drinking this from the can, it's not hit-and-miss. The perfect mode to bring an excellent beer camping with you.
POSITIVE	Poured into a pint glass.  Pours a dark caramel brown with a half inch of sticky head. Great looking beer! Lacing down the entire glass!  Smells of butterscotch, scotch, and a slight earthiness due to the heavy malts. You can tell this beer means business.  Initially the beer's malt and scotch characteristics hit the tongue. This is quickly followed by a hop bite which works perfectly for me. Finishes deliciously creamy and smooth!  Overall a fantastic offering from Founders. Interesting style I dont find myself drinking enough of. This is my second time purchasing Dirty Bastard and I will definitely be looking for it during the cold Chicago winter.
NEGATIVE	Has a Smokey barbecue aroma, with a smooth mouthfeel. I tasted almonds and subtle hops. After trying the Weizen first I was thought that the Urbock would follow suit and be disappointing. Well, I wasn't greatly impressed. I did find this brew to be much smoother and less aggressive in terms of that Smokey flavor. This would go well with a burger or barbecue
NEGATIVE	Pours into my glass a deep dark garnet brown that borders on black when you view it from a distance. A quarter inch of khaki head on top leaves some splotchy lacing as it falls. Aromas start off with dark fruits and toffee melding with some roast, coffee and cocoa. Piney, herbal hops make themselves known alongside dense malts.  First sip brings smooth, dense malts upfront with tons of dark fruits, toffee and roast. Notes of cocoa and coffee combine in as the brew flows down with a good hit of bitterness from pine resiny hops. Sweetness is there but is well balanced. Alcohol is well hidden also. Tasty dark barleywine.  Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy with good carbonation. Pretty easy to drink considering the ABV on this one. Overall, another tasty treat from Founders and a nice twist on a standard barleywine. Borderline on the price for this one though.
POSITIVE	An excellent "American Pale Ale"!  Lots of western hops in aroma, taste and finish - tons of flavour, beuatifully balanced, and all that accomplished at 5% ABV. I've heard that it's not possible to get flavour at low alcohol, but this batch certainly proves otherwise. I look forward to trying any future batches I can get my hands on!
POSITIVE	Pours a dark ruby brown with a brown head. Smells of oak and booze.   Very rich, toffee-like notes enriched with vanilla and wood. The body is relatively hefty but appropriate carbonation lifts it and thus prevents any cloying or overbearing backbone. Interesting nutty note in the finish. A bit chewy but dries down a bit in the finish.  A nice fireside sipper. It could work with a bourbon-spiked bread pudding.
POSITIVE	More orange in color than amber with a thin vail of head and not much stick. Aromas are dominated by bitter as is the taste. The bitter is more of the bitter found in black licorice. The beer is medium bodied and fairly crisp. The finish is clean with a mild citrus and even some ripe pear or apple flavors showing. This is a sound brew but nothing astounding, though I bet it would be much better on tap.
NEGATIVE	A: The pour is a perfectly clear golden straw color with a finger or two of white head that dissipates before too long.  S: Slight skunkiness up front, but I don't get much of that after the first sniff or two. Definite adjunct quality to it, probably corn. Light floral hop notes and a hint of bread.  T: Sweet bready malts with the faintest adjunct sweetness on the back end. Earthy and floral hops to it with only the lightest bitterness. A little bit of yeast flavor in there as well.  M: Light to medium in body with a medium level of carbonation.  O: A decent Helles, but not even the best I've had from Weltenburger.
POSITIVE	W00t! Received a 4 pack from hoppymeal at DLD (Thanks Derek!!!!) as well as a bottle from nlmartin from BC2 (Thanks Nate!!!!)  Pours an absolutely opaque black, no light visible, thick brown head forms, wicked lacing, settles down to a pretty layer, very sticky. Smell is heavenly, roast coffee, lots of dark chocolate, fruits, toffee, bourbon, bit of alcohol, oaky vanilla, more coffee roast, insane rich and amazing. Taste is insane roasty goodness, like fresh espresso, lots of vanilla, bourbon, oak, chocolate, more espresso, toffee, some dark fruits, tiny amount of alcohol, more espresso and more vanilla, fucking fantastic. Mouthfeel is full bodied, nice and thick, low carbonation, very coating, nice alcohol warming. Easily the best oak aged beer I've had. Captures it perfectly, amazing harmony between the beer and barrel. Way too drinkable, just an insane beer, deserves its accolades and then some. Thanks Derek and Nate!!!
POSITIVE	Poured into DFH Signature glass.  A: This is what a stout should look like, nice dark black with a full mocha cap.  S: Lots here, I'll try to do it in order. Coffee and chocolate, vanillan, toffee, chocolate again, and lastly bourbon followed by roasted malts.  T: This comes in waves as well, and its everything you smell, only opposite. First hit is the bourbon presence moving on all the way to the coffee finish.  M: Just where I'd want a barrel aged stout, full and creamy without being too oily. Bourbon bite lends its warmth throughout the entire palette.  D: This is a great sipper for a snowed in day, should be the sign of a good night to follow. This is one that is better as it warms slightly, but I find if you wait to long it ends up a little thin and disappointing. Its no real worry though, these go down fairly quickly even sipping.
POSITIVE	The beer smells really chocolaty and sweet. The beer is extremely black with a small head, and it goes to a ring. The beer is really chocolaty and sweet. A slight bit of alcohol comes through as well. Extremely balanced. The beer is creamy and thick. The beer is super easy to drink as well.
NEGATIVE	Appearance- reddish gold. No sedimentation or haze.  Smell- sweet and crisp.   Taste- very malted and scrumptious. slightly watery and has a robust sweetness.  Mouthfeel- a little thick, but thins in the finish.  Drinkability- easy to drink.   I enjoyed this beer, drinks well and has a bold flavor. The finish is quick and has a neat minty spicy thing happening.
POSITIVE	16 oz draught at Mews Tavern in Wakefield, RI. Golden/yellow straw pour with a fizzy white head. Aroma of pepper and malt. Great balanced body with a taste of lemon and honey combined with a nice bitter peppery finish. Fantastic pils, went great with fries and a huge burger.
POSITIVE	A- IT begins with a big head, but after several minutes the head goes completely away. It has a dark clear color  S- The smell is very detailed. The only things that you smell is like a bonfire smell and a sausage smell. When smelling you smell immediately a sausage that's combined with a fire.   T- The tastes excatly like it smells, It starts with a cooking over a firethat smooth watery taste then goes onto like tasting some meat  M- The mouthfeel is good, it's very smooth and the carbonation goes with the smooth feeling  D- I would have this if i'm in the mood to have a beer like this, but if not, then I wouldn't have it much then
POSITIVE	a bit lighter than i expected with a nice sized light tan head made up of large bubbles that laces well.  rather light aroma of raisins, some vanilla and oakiness, toffee, and caramel.  flavor starts with raisins, dark fruits, a bit of a metallic sensation, but is smoothed out a subtle oakiness with some smooth caramel sweetness that gives way to a slight alcohol heat on the finish.  a bit thin with very little carbonation.  I thought it would be a bit stronger in aroma and flavor with a thicker feel, but its still tasty.
POSITIVE	A - A golden colored beer that was a bit darker than their regular IPA. Decent head that had a ton of stick to the sides.  S - Very dank, warrior hops really dank this one up. Lot of grapefruit and rind on the nose with some resin.  T - Taste is pretty good if the more grapefruity and dank IPAs are your thing. A definite double, as the alcohol is slightly more noticable than in the Peace Frog. Not bad.  M - Creamy, moderate carbonation, just enough bite.  O - A solid beer, another pretty good one from Haymarket.
POSITIVE	Got this at Pauls in Emmitsburg, MD.  A: deep brown, that looks a little red when held up to light. A very small head that quickly dissipates, but ample lacing.  S: Chocolate smells, a dominant sweet smell up front, nutty.  T/M: Sweet up front. A bit over-sweet. Then a sour hop bite that dominates as it goes down. Low level of carbonation makes the drink feel very smooth and very thin.  D: A thinner, lighter beer for this style, thus a decent drinkability rating.
NEGATIVE	22 oz. bomber bottle with a happy and probably drunk green with a white chest frog toasting a pitcher of black beer in front of a bright yellow rectangle. This frog is toasting his mug so hard, that he's just whipping his beer all around and spilling it into his little secluded Akron pond. Above the frog is the name of the brewery in big black letters, but the letter "o" is replaced with a pitcher of yellow beer. Just below the black beer pitcher the frog is toasting, is a red oval that states this is an Ohio beer. I didn't know Ohio breweries had a symbol. To the left of happy drunk frog is the Government warning, the city it's brewed in, and the barcode. On the other side of the frog is a little paragraph telling you about the beer, its specifications, and another picture of the drunk happy frog. This little picture had him toasting a mug of yellow beer. Don't bother to look for a date or batch number because there isn't one anywhere on the bottle or label. Served in a small Great Lakes Christmas Ale Snifter.   Appearance: Do you remember seeing the mug of black beer the frog is toasting on the label? To save money, Hoppin' Frog took the same ink they used for their label and then bottled it as B.O.R.I.S. The Crusher. This beer had the same size head of foam as brewed ink (if it's possible) does. The only thing there was, was just a small skim of Cherry Coke colored foam that dissipated quite quickly into a few colored rings and no lace whatsoever anywhere around the glass. After about a minute, it looked like I poured a glass of ink instead of a black beer. There was nothing there to indicate that it was a beer by just looking at it from a distance. In case your pen runs out of black ink, just refill it back up with some B.O.R.I.S. The Crusher.  Smell: The aroma of this beer was just a little bit of this and a little bit of that. Nothing really stands out by itself because they all combined together to create a very nice and pleasant aroma. That means it had a little bit of roasted malts, a pinch of chocolate covered cherries, a dab of regular black cherries, a hint of roasted coffee beans, and then ended with a little nip of alcohol. Toward the bottom of the glass, the alcohol aroma really kicks into gear and dominates over all of the other aromas that were in this beer.  Taste: The first flavor that hopped its way onto my tastebuds were the high quality dark chocolate covered cherries. Not the kind of chocolate covered cherries you would find at your local drug store, the kind you can find at your fine local chocolatier. After that came the roasted malts, chocolate malts, black cherries, other dark fruits, a hint of roasted coffee beans, and a huge alcohol bullfrog drop kick at the finish line. That alcohol kick at the end really warms up your throat and esophagus. It almost makes you feel like you just drank a shot of whiskey and not a sip of B.O.R.I.S. The Crusher. Where was the robust hop character the label said that this beer was going have? I don't know, but it could have used it. There was some bitterness at the end, but it was more of a dark chocolate bitter than a hop bitter.  Mouthfeel: When I first took a few big sips of this beer, there wasn't any aftertaste to it. The dark taste hopped on in and then hopped on out without leaving an aftertaste of anything. When it warms up and you get toward the bottom of the glass, an aftertaste of bitter dark chocolate and alcohol emerges. If you couldn't guess already, this beer was thick, chewy, and full bodied to the max.   Drinkability: If you drink the beer cold, you really don't have a problem with it. If you let it sit there to warm up, you're going to be sorry. All the roasted and dark flavors will be there, but you're really going to feel the burn, alcohol burn that is. If you like big chewy alcoholic beers, then this Hoppin' Frog is for you! Will this beer crush like you like the label stated? Not really. It will be the alcohol burn that will do you in and not its dark and roasted flavors.
POSITIVE	This is the bourbon barrel aged version of Dirty Bastard, which I enjoyed very much. Oak aging usually does not add a lot for me, though I'm endlessly interested in the way it alters the flavor. This brew comes in at 9.2% ABV in a 12 oz bottle from Joe Canal's in Lawrenceville, NJ for about $2.50 a bottle and 200 Calories.  The color is beautiful. A deep ruby red, almost opaque. Good lacing with a thinner but persistent light tan foamy head.  The aroma is sweet, oak, and tea. Alcohol is present in the nose. Lots of leather, and the aroma is quite strong.  The flavor is mostly whiskey. Very penetrated with the oak aging. Good finish, smoky, dark and burnt. A superlative scotch ale. Founders knows how to do it right.  The palate is prickly -- lightly carbonated and long lasting. Very dark, intense flavors. A very well done brew.  Overall, I like this quite a bit. Better, IMHO, than Oaked Arrogant Bastard which does not balance the aging nearly as well. I'd have this again. Not a favorite, but I simply prefer heavier stouts.
POSITIVE	On tap at CBC. It poured a ruby tinted cordovan color with a medium sized beige head. A full sweet malty and floral hop aroma is equally potent. A mild alcohol fuminess is released soon after the pour. The caramel malt has a sweet flavor of toffee and fresh bread. White grapefruit bitterness and mild lemony taste provide a nice hoppiness. A slightly metallic tang gives it the IPA edge. The alcohol is noticeable throughout, but never interferes.
NEGATIVE	Found this one down in St. Louis and had it hanging around since then. Hopefully it's not past its prime. Pours into my glass a nice deep golden yellow color with active carbonation and a half inch of bone white head on top. So far so good! Aromas start off with light grains with a touch of lemon. Lightly toasted with a mellow grassy hop aroma. Slightly spicy as well. Fairly nice, yet unassuming.  First sip brings light grainy malts touched by a bit of lemon zest. Crisp, clean with a very light toast. Flows down with some spiciness in there along with a hit of grassy hops on the back of the palate. A nice easy drinking brew.  Mouthfeel is rather light, however ample carbonation ups the ante and provides a nice flow across the palate. Easy to drink and refreshing. I could drink quite a bit of this on a hot day. Nothing spectacular here, just a good straight up no frills blonde ale. Glad I picked up a bottle of this to sample.
NEGATIVE	Ok, so this brew is fantastic. If you like porters this is a must try. It has a nose that is very roasted barley and dark coffee and cocoa but the taste is extremely chocolatey. I love this beer, it is really a great example of a good porter. Get it, drink it, love it
POSITIVE	Acquired from unclejedi through the Little Guy BIF, so a big Thank you goes out to him. Poured from a 12oz bottle into a US tumbler pint glass.   A: The beer is a bright brown color with a thin but dense tan head that fades slowly and leaves a thick lace on the glass.   S: The aroma is of nuts, caramelized malt, a little chocolate and a touch of hops.   T: The taste is quite interesting, very well-balanced and not overly sweet as some brown ales can be. Flavors of nuts, chocolate & caramel start out, and then a mild hops flavor kicks in. As the all begin to fades a light flavor of dark fruit remains in the sides of your mouth.   M: Crisp and very smooth, medium body, medium carbonation, finish is clean.   D: Very tasty, goes down easily, good representation of style, this is a beer that well-worth sticking with for an evening and is the type of beer that can either be a good sipper or a good pounder.
NEGATIVE	Opened with a pop! Poured a deep black with an off white head. Lots of roasted barley and citrusy hops in aroma also some chocolate. Aggressive roasted/patent malt bitterness. Some tangieness from the rye. Long dry finish of roasted malt and hops. Not sure if I could drink a lot of this.
NEGATIVE	Bottled 4/21/2011, into a pint.  Dark amber red in appearance, hazy with little to no head, pretty lousy carbonation as well. Looks thick, syrupy and viscous.  I'm having a really hard time getting past the booze on this, although there are faint hints of burnt sugar, molasses and some raisins. However, the booze are a really dominating presence.  As with the nose, heavy booze with some caramel and vanilla sweetness on the finish. A bit of smoke and woodiness as well, finishing hot from the alcohol with no signs of hop bitterness to be found. Age would probably be very kind to this one.  Definitely full bodied and rather thick. Combined with the booziness, this is a sipper all the way.   Not a huge fan of this one, but with some age, maybe the booze will fade and the malt can become more prevalent to create a better balance. Probably my least liked beer I've had from Founders.
POSITIVE	12 oz. bottle courtesy of frozensoul327. Huge thanks for this one!  Finally able to snare this bottle from the DBF and give it a proper review. On the pour, the first thing I notice is how "thick" the beer is...almost as if it is reluctant to leave the bottle. Opaque darkness sits beneath the graham cracker color head. Thick, sticky head that not only stays at a finger-thick level, but also manages to leaves soapy splotches of lace on my glass.  Aromas are heavenly. A fresh pot of coffee wafts from this beer, mixed with some char and a nutty note as well...almonds? Slight vinous note as well. Chunks of bitter baking chocolate thrown in for good measure.   Flavor is wonderful. Chocolate-infused fresh coffe up front. Middle sees some bitterness creep in, mixed with flaked oatmeal. More of a "no-bake chocolate cookie" flavor, if you've ever had them. Finish really dries out quickly, leaving a powdery dryness on the palate. Very, very "clean" in the finish. There's definitely an aftertaste, but it's very crisp and pronounced. Wonderful.  So smooth on the palate. Each component of the beer makes itself known, yet doesn't overshadow any of the others in this blend of delicious flavors. The 8.3% ABV is only slightly noticed, well-woven into the fabric of this amazing creation. One bottle is not enough. This is one to seek out again. Thouroughly enjoyed and much-appreciated.
NEGATIVE	Hazy "live beer" amber color with a strong 2 finger ivory colored head. Great head retention (like an ice cream float) and lots of sticky lacings. This head won't go down. . .   Aroma is full of hops, citrus and piney. Malt flavor of toasted malt and caramel.   Moutfeel is creamy with strong carbonation. Very dry with a bitter and puckering finish.   Flavor has a very strong hop bitterness and is a bit sour, malt flavor has good amount of caramel maltyness but is really overshadowed by the bitterness.  A decent IPA, The aroma is great but I found the actual bitterness a bit overdone, it takes away from the malt flavor. Still not bad, but there are just so many good ipas out there it is really a competitive style.
POSITIVE	This is supposed to be a brewpub only release, but somehow the guys at The BlueDog got their hands on a keg.  Poured into a tulip glass. Color was golden yellow with a slight orange tint. Minimal amount of head. Maybe a fingers worth at best. Pretty soapy and slightly off white in color.  Smell is really nice. I believe this is brewed only using Summit hops. The smell they give off is wonderful. Lots of citrusy grapefruit and some light floral notes.   This beer tastes awesome. Grapefruit, orange zest. Very dry and bitter finish but super easy to drink. I had 3 glasses of this at the Pliny the Younger event. If i could get this regularly i would buy it by the case. As always, Founders comes through!
POSITIVE	Really getting into this brewery. After trying their Black Rye I've been trying to get my hands on their other stuff. This is another solid offering. Pours a deep but clear brown color with ruby highlights and a pretty good head that sticks aroudn for a while. A real strong bourbon smell coming from this one. Nice. It's present in the taste as well, but it isn't overwhelming, as it mixes nicely with all the sweet flavors this beer has to offer. Nice toffee malts and a bit of chocolate, as well as some raisins and a slight (very slight) smoked feel. Very warming, this is great right now (May) but would be even better on a cold winter evening when you're snowed in. Slick and slightly chewy mouthfeel, but still pretty drinkable at %8.3. An interesting brew from a company that tends to produce some pretty unique stuff.
POSITIVE	A: Midnight black with a brown thick foamy head. Served in a snifter.  S: Chocolate aromas, this is a very inviting brew. Every sip required the time to take in and enjoy the smell of this brew,  T: Complex flavors that overwhelm the pallet and take time to truly appreciate how much work was put into creating such a masterpiece. From first sip to savoring aftertaste, this is a smooth and wonderfully complex stout.  M: Full bodied beer with a quality to it that feels as though this beer needs to be chewed. Very thick with an oil viscous quality that leaves its mark on the side of the glass and your mouth.  O: Best stout to-date that I have tried. Very lucky to have found this beer on tap weeks after it sold out in the stores the day it arrived.
NEGATIVE	Clear & a light reddish copper colour with a pinky sized, creamy white head that leaves a tiny bit of lacing on the glass.  Mild on the nose with very little smell at all, after some effort I could detect some background caramel aromas and hints of toffee along with a biscuit like, malty aroma but nothing else really.  Caramel and butterscotch are the most prominent flavours from this one along with a bitter, toffee like taste. I was quite disappointed with the taste of this one, it was pretty basic and unexciting.  Creamy on the palate to begin with and minimal carbonation and an overly bitter end.  This one had almost nothing going for it and was a real struggle to drink; not a beer I enjoyed or would have again. Only the butterscotch notes were pleasant but not much else.  1001 Beers Blog: http://abarwithnoname.wordpress.com
NEGATIVE	Pours deep garnet with a large lasting head and rings of lacing. Nose shows lots of sweet malt with nutty and caramel characters at the forefront. Roasted malt adds some extra depth. Theres a faint oxidised not which mixes well with the rich malt. Flavours perfectly mirror the aromas. Maybe the roasted malt shows through a little stronger. Carbonation is pretty full on.
NEGATIVE	Received in trade from GPHarris, thanks for the opportunity. Pours a deep reddish brown with a smallish tightly bubbled khaki head that quickly dissipates to a ring on top. Smells of caramel, brown bread, applesauce, brown sugar. There's more in the nose than I was expecting. Taste is light and sweet malts with a hint of tart and astringency. Watered down brown sugar water with hints of fruit and bread kind sums up this experience. Thinnish body medium to high level of carbonation, watery prickly mouthfeel. This smelled a whole lot better than it tasted. Average beer at best.
NEGATIVE	Poured into New Belgium globe from shared growler purchased at Bruisin' Ales.   A- Poures black with burgundy corners into the glass. A very vigorous pour from a fresh growler gave almost a cm head for a split second. The beer pretty much pours a dead looking liquid that isn't all that appetizing. Usually hard for me to go under a 3 for appearance, but this one does it.  S- Alright... this is where my sanity among the BA community comes into question; but hear me out. This beer has that distinct awkward aroma of the liquid secretion from a dog's anal glands... haha, I'm not kidding. It's so messed up. I asked my girlfriend to take a whiff and she completely agreed. And I'm not talking about the feces itself- this beer does NOT smell like poo. It is the very different aroma that each dog excretes with their poo (also the aroma that causes them to sniff each other's butts to say hello)... Call me crazy, but I'm serious on this one  T/M- Now that I am finally somehow past the aroma to take a drink; its only marginally better. To begin any flavor that may be contained in this beer is incredibly watered down. I don't get any roasted, toasted, chocolate, etc malts at all. There is a tiny warmth on the end of the palate from the chilis. And if I tried reallly hard to be imaginitive while drinking this I could say it had some oak woodiness. As it warmed I did get a bit of a sweet nuttiness that finally came out to say hello. Otherwise- nothing. Very thin body (again, watery) and practically no carbonation.   O- Missed the mark. I really think the aroma instantly killed any chance I had at enjoying the flavor of this beer. Though the growler did open with a fresh hiss, maybe it wasn't sealed enough and that's what lead to the lack of carbonation and watery feel? I really don't know and I'm not sure I care. I gave this beer a chance but ended up drainpouring it after about 3 sips and letting it warm in my hand for 20 minutes. I think I just had such high expectations for what this could be... Sad day but it does get an extra .5 point for trying something that you don't get in every beer
POSITIVE	I got chocolate, coffee, and malt on the nose. The stout presented a medium chocolate brown color. The head was difficult to judge due to the fact I tasted at a festival from basically a large shot glass. The taste was that of sweet chocolate, coffee, and malt. It was a smooth clean finish. Very drinkable and highly enjoyable Stout.
POSITIVE	Pours deep ruby red with a quickly disappearing off white head.  Resin smell dominates. Very piney, with a bitrusy background. Alcohol presence enough to make your eyes watery. some raisiny malt notes.  Upon drinking, instant hop gratification ensues. Huge flavors of kumquat and pomegranate. Raisiny sweetness. Leaves a very bitter nearly rubber flavor on the back of the tongue. Lingers, just won't quit. Warming alcohol on the way down.  Big and chewy, nearly oily, the only improvement this beer could use is a bit more dryness. Other than that a fine beverage. Close enough to 120 min. for government work with 1/3 the pricetag.
NEGATIVE	A - Poured out a cloudy, golden orange color with a one-finger, white head of bubble foam. It left some sudsy trails of lace on the glass.  S - It smelled of lemon, wheat and some yeast. It was okay.  T - It tasted of lemon, cracked wheat and some spiciness. Not fabulous but better than some other American attempts at a witbier.  M - It was crisp, sharp and smooth. A light bodied ale with a clean finish.  O - This is a nice witbier. Thanks to my brother-in-law for hooking me up with a mixed case from Costco.
POSITIVE	Bottle from Nov 08 had aging.  Pours black with some lacing around the glass. No head to begin with. Smells a little bit like bourbon. Had to take a huge whiff just to get that out of it. The taste is a little chocolatey mixed with some cofee. Mouthfeel wasn't great. Felt really light and thin for a stout. That being said it's easy to drink if you are ok with it being thin.
POSITIVE	Light/medium bodied, clear golden color with a nice white head.   Aroma is sweet toasted malt, hay, and a bit of hops spice.   Taste is somewhat sweet and malty with a very nice crisp hops finish.   Very well balanced, smooth and very easy to drink. This was perfect with barbecue.   Definitely one of the best of the Pilsner or lager beers.
POSITIVE	This was the best beer I had at Broad Ripple when I was recently there. This is a great example of a Bitter: hazy golden color, moderate lacing, great smell (biting hops) and the taste is amazing. Perfectly balanced malt and hops; not too bitter and just the right amount of fruity sweetness. This and their double IPA go great with fish'n'chips.
POSITIVE	Poured from twelve ounce bottle into a standard pint glass Pale golden in color, with a half-inch sticky head of foam Aroma-Big, piney hops Taste-Full-on big, fresh hops-subtle citrus, and a long, bittering finish Overall, big fresh hop flavor and aroma-Another winner from Founder's
POSITIVE	This is the first E.S.B. I have ever tried, and I'm sure to have more.   A- At first glace it looks very appetizing with a warm amber color and a nice off white head that did fade a bit quick.  S- Very faint smell. However has a slight hopiness to it with overtones of spices.  T- Loved it! Mild hops with a bitter finish. Which is the way it's supposed to taste. Definetly reached for another one.  M- Refreshing yet warm at the same time.  D- I was surprised when my glass was empty. Goes down very easily and leaves you wanting more.
POSITIVE	Pours pitch black with a hint of dark red brown. A good whiff of smoke comes through in the pour. Taste is of smoke and medium malt-with a little hop bitterness. Taste is of smoked ham, but it isn't heavy-it is light. Mouthfeel is light to medium and drinkability high.
POSITIVE	One exceptional beer. I'm shocked at the low ranking. This is the standard for pilseners, it delivers a fresh crisp drinking experience. Pilsner Urquell is one Eurpean beer that I can also trust to find fresh and alive upon imbibing in this continent. A sign of class and heritage.
NEGATIVE	A: A golden reddish hue with no haze. Must be well filtered. 1 finger white head. S: Cherries. Sweet Cherries. Spices like cinnamon and nutmeg.  T: Pie cherries with a light allspice aftertaste. There are some biscuit like malts in there. Very nice. M: Semi-dry (or semi-sweet) and slightly tart. Lots of carbonation.  D: I love this beer, but one glass is enough. Just a tad too sweet to be an easy drinker. The cherry flavors pair well with mild cheeses and fruity desserts. Founders really doesn't make a bad beer, and this is proof. The fruitiest and strangest brew still tastes great.
POSITIVE	Pours more golden than red, with head that's nice, dense and retaining well. Lace is pretty nice too. Needs more red colour for sure, but otherwise damn fine-looking beer.  Smells very pleasant with tangy fruit and lots of pie spice - cinnamon, clove and star anise primarily. Hint of raisin, with peach and citrus and a hint of pine resin late. Sultry and spicy, but a nice fresh twang. A real winner here.  Taste is Belgian and malty, lots of burnt sugar verging on quite roasty bitter. Molasses, with some clove and aniseed and a hint of pepper towards the back. Hit of hops on the finish with resiny notes and a fresh citric twang, but Belgian spiced malt lingers on the back. Very pleasant.  Smooth and full, quite sticky though. Would like more texture, maybe more hop pull or spicy yeast dryness.  Tasty brew with lots of flavour. Tangy and spicy but maintains a drinkability from good use of malt.
POSITIVE	On-tap at Haymarket for d0b's birthday bash. Served in a 12oz tulip.  A - A thin white foam settles some wisps and a thin ring of bubbles, leaving behind minimal lace. Transparent golden body.  S - Wheat, Belgain yeast, lightly phenolic, toasted grains, some fruity esters and lemony notes. Good amount of punch for only 4.5%.  T - The taste is initially fairly mild, but it grows as the beer cross the palate with notes of bread, wheat, toasted grains, and a bit of lemony hop, finishing with a hefty does of tangy Belgian yeast.  M - Light body that's a tad watery, particularly with the lower carbonation. Texture has a bit of chaffed wheat to it. Nothing unexpected from a table beer.  D - It's a nice session/table beer. Taste is surprisingly solid and potent for the low alcohol content, and the Belgian yeast character is well-integrated and pleasant.
POSITIVE	hello, my name is Dave and I am 24 years old. my beer drinking days began when i was in high school. my first beer was a warm Budweiser on a beach at the outer banks. i decided i hated beer. later that day we drank cold MGD's next to a fire and my opinion started to change. after choking down 4, i was lit.... and hooked i guess. i was a pretty typical drinker on a college budget so i drank my fair share of hamm's and PBR. i even got a keystone light tattoo when i turned 19 on a bet (no joke). i still think it's funny but probably won't a couple years down the road. about four years ago, i was at a local watering hole called chumley's. i was in an adventurous mood, so i decided to jump out of my safe beer bubble and try something called three Floyd's Robert the Bruce. it's a Scottish ale made right in the state i live in, Indiana. 'wow, this doesn't taste like beer' i thought, not realizing the numerous things wrong with that sentence. slowly i began to fall in love with the hop and everything that comes with it. Then it was ambers and browns. Then my obsession with IPA's and stouts and barley wines and then imperial stouts and IPA's. I've come a long way, and i'm sure my beer journey has just begun, but one thing is sure... i love beer, and THIS is the best one i have EVER had.  EDIT: I wrote this review over a year and 1/2 ago, and I would like to adjust it. The 2009-2010 KBS that I have tried were in all actuality, the best beers I have ever had. The way the vanilla and the oakiness of the bourbon barrel merged with the vanilla and almost malted milk ball like flavor was hard to top. Now that I have an opportunity to try the 2011, I must adjust my score. It seems to have a roasted coffee dominance that clashes with the high alcohol presence and over carbonation. Will adjust the score accordingly next year. Not horrible. Toffee just isn't my favorite flavor.
POSITIVE	Sampled on 6-21-07 2007 Vintage  Pours a hugely slick deep red/brown. A darkish tan head forms on top, and leaves big, foamy lacing.  Smell is all coffee, and then bourbon. I seem to get an alcohol smell, but it's probably just my association with the bourbon. Rich, super dark malts followed by a distinct hoppiness.  Taste is superb. Huge malt backbone with a big woody bourbon kick right in the middle. Flavors of oak, dark fruits, anise, and vanilla precede a surprising grassy hop balance. The aftertaste is smooth and oaky, with just a hint of booze.  Mouthfeel is fantastic. Ultra-think and super-smooth, it really conveys the bourbon flavor and oak-aged character.  Drinkability is surprisingly good, very strong flavors but all in a masterfully delicate balance.  Overall, one hell of a beer. The complexity shows an obscene amount of skill from the brewer, and the immense flavors show a daringness as well. Highly recommended.
NEGATIVE	An interesting pour from my brown bottle. This beer has historically, from notes that is, poured an orange amber in color. Now, from this new mixed case which includes a Wit and an IPA, the Pale Ale pours quite pale. Downright golden in color, perhaps a deep straw, and quite clear. A different beer indeed which lacks any true carbonation and offers only a fleeting cap of foam before surrendering to a thin ring.  Nose is ultra pale in nature. Bit of malt in the background and with a very light hint of citric hops. Quite 'Blonde Ale' in nature at best, and thin at that.  Flavor follows suit. All malt perhaps and slightly bready with a minimal hop profile. Offers a moderate amount of coarse spice on the feel. A decent Blonde Ale to a point but somewhat of a fail for a Pale Ale.  Offers a hollow and over filtered yeast lameness which is somewhat reminiscent of a Sam Adams beer. In fact, I think that's what it is...Oops, I'm sorry, did I say that out loud?
POSITIVE	A medium orange colored clear body. Half an inch of pure white head stayed a few minutes. Tiny, carbonation in average amounts. Sticky lacing clung in sheets.   Light fruity aromas up front in the initial nose full. Scents of grapes blend with a bitter hop backbone and a hint of alcohol. A decently balanced aroma, but not overly strong.  A very bitter blend of hop flower tastes. Bite of the hop overpowers all the other flavors. Alcohol wafts in and out of the taste but, can't hold against the bitterness.  A nice viscosity on the mouth surfaces. Carbonation has very little pop on the tongue.   A decent brew. Good against a very strong cheese. Not the best in style, but an clear hops dominance is a nice touch. Must try for lovers of the style.
POSITIVE	Brownish black and opaque with a cocoa powder colored head of thick dimpled foam that leaves a half inch stubborn cap.  Aroma of roasty malt and cocoa, faint notes of coffee bean.  Rich flavor of darkly roasted malt, charred bark, cocoa and espresso. Lots of other nuances like raisin, molasses, fig, bourbon, root beer, and licorice. Moderate bitterness complements. Coffee notes linger. ABV is well hidden.  Even mouthfeel, full with a thick feeling. Finishes slightly dry and tannic. Tasty beer, very drinkable. Thanks to BuckeyeNation for sending this gift over.
NEGATIVE	Poured from 12oz. bottle into a pint glass. A - Pours a clear copper with a tan head that falls to a mottled skim layer. Some nice lacing. S - Toasted malts hit my olfactory equipment first. A little hop bitterness. T - Some hop bitterness, some biscuity malt and some fruit. Decent. M/F - Medium body. Carbonation level is a little higher than my favorite British versions but not bad for an American. D - This is decent though I really like the Stout's versions of German brews which are totally in their wheelhouse.
NEGATIVE	22oz. bomber into tulip on 12/23/09.  A - Clear, sparsely carbonated rusty orange body with wispy off-white head that diminished to a thin ring of retention and left virtually no lacing.   S - Intensely spicy with equal parts cinnamon, nutmeg, clove and allspice dominating the aroma. This brew displays a hint of pumpkin character, perhaps, but is overshadowed by its assertive spiciness.   T - Just as with the aroma, the flavor is dominated by an assortment of warm autumn spices including cinnamon, nutmeg and clove. There's even a hint of ginger in the mix. Finishes with a bready, doughy malt character reminiscent of a spicy holiday cookie.   M - Medium bodied with a warm, sticky mouthfeel and prickly carbonation. Finishes with a bit of spicy heat on the back of the tongue.   D - Pretty solid imperial pumpkin ale, although I wouldn't rate this on par with the likes of, say, Pumking. Ultimately, the spiciness gets a bit heavy-handed, which prevents the pumpkin character from really shining.
POSITIVE	Not a bad beer but not one I would consider a classic Impy Stout. Reminded me more of an upgrade to an AB product called Winter's Bourbon Barrel stout. Nose had hints of licorice, burnt oak and bourbon, and the taste followed suit. Finish wa a little thin and short, but this would make a fairly decent winter session beer on a cold night.  Worth a try at a decent price.
NEGATIVE	A - nice and dark but the head vanished quickly.  S - roasted bet a little bitter plus an odd under tone.  T - starts out really nice, but gets a bit too bitter in the after taste.  M - medium tingle all Oct the mouth.  D - the flavor makes you want to drink it, but the bitter finish makes you not want too many.
NEGATIVE	Poured a nice and very clear ruby tinted brown with a good two finger hight head of off white, tannish colored lace. Smell was good, lots of bready ,malts with a kicker of bittering hops. Nothing spetacular but still a quality brew. Nice light feel and good carbonation stayed until the end. Overall this was not a bad beer at all. I have had better, but this was still very sessionable and something that I am sure wood not dissapoint. Defintly a tick above the average Oktoberfest, but nothing that was fall down awesome. Though the finish had a nice touh of sweetnes to it, some caramel and even a tocuh of roasted nuts that seemed to linger and push the flavor forward.
POSITIVE	Purchased at Wine and Beer Westpark in Glen Allen, VA after a tasting of the beer - poured into stone pairing glass  Pours a pink color with soda like head. Looks like cherry 7up. Not much head. Smells vaguely of cherries, very nice though. Tastes good, very light and refreshing and the cherry taste on the back end is nice and very real, not artificial.   Overall this is an interesting beer and unexpected coming from Founders. I like it and would consider buying it again, I bet this would make a great beer-mosa
POSITIVE	Nice clear amber pour with a frothy white head.  Smell is orange peel, a little pine. Good hoppy aroma.  Taste is clean and crisp citrus hops. Low malts, a lot of hops.   A little thin, but it's smooth and fairly well balanced.  Easy drinking, will definitely have a few of these.
POSITIVE	Roughly equal parts brick red and burnt orange that becomes brighter and more appealing when backlit. The golden brown sugar colored cap is barely one finger in thickness after an increasingly elevated pour (which makes me concerned about carbonation). A thin, delicate necklace of lace can be seen above the melting disk of foam.  The aroma is reminiscent of autumn for some reason. It's toasted malty and earthy and fallen leafy and nutty and... well... it's quintessentially bock-like. It smells, and probably tastes, a fraction darker than a standard bock, yet not as dark as a doppelbock. And I'm sure it smells better than goat's breath.  Full disclosure: I'm not a huge bock fanatic. That said, this is an excellent version because it's malty enough and full enough and dark enough. Dumping in what tastes like roasted and/or chocolate malt (a guess in this case) almost always adds flavor interest to what tends to be a relatively simple style of beer otherwise.  On second thought, GBB is darker than some doppelbocks that I've run across. The flavor profile consists of caramel, dried figs, toasted almonds, cocoa powder, bitter tea leaves and tobacco. Warming has opened up a beer that wasn't exactly closed to begin with. Don't start it too cold or you'll miss out.  The mouthfeel is big enough, but not bubbled enough. I always hate to mark a beer down for either too much or too little carbonation because it can't be easy to get things just right. Especially when bottle-conditioning is involved. This one probably isn't bottle-conditioned, but the sentiment remains.  Goat's Breath Bock is good because the brewers didn't churn out a by-the-numbers version that would have bored all of us to tears. They took the goat by the horns and found a way to inject a whole lot of complexity and a whole lot of drinkability into a beer that deserves much wider distribution. I'd settle for one state north of Missouri.
POSITIVE	Very flavorful Northwestern IPA and very fresh tasting. I couldn't smell much as allergies were kicking my butt that day but there was nothing wrong with my tastebuds  Appearance: Pale gold and cloudy with minimal head  Smell: Earthy hops with a malt back  Taste: Earty, piney, fresh grain notes balanced with malt  Mouthfeel: Lingering maltiness with bitterness; well crafted indeed  Drinkability: More earthy than citrusy; well balanced with the malt and grains providing a very flavorful and sipping IPA without the flavors becoming overpowering
POSITIVE	Poured from 12oz bottle into a tulip glass.  Appearance: Pours a dark amber hue with two fingers of fluffy foam that settles after a while.   Smell: Malty sweetness that comes across with raisin, cinnamon, toffee. Great aroma.   Taste: Sweet bready malt, raisin, toffee, slight vanilla as it warms. Very good.   Mouthfeel: Full bodied with a slight stingy-alcohol burn at the end.   Drinkability: While I can't see this being an everyday beer, I definitely will enjoy this again. I have 3 bottles left from my 4 pack that I want to age a little bit.
POSITIVE	This beer was served in a shifter.  A- A bright clear amber body. Actively carbonate. Thin white head with little retention. The lacing on the glass looks like pancake batter.   S- Vanilla oak, brown sugar and caramel aromas play with banannas. This smells like an idealized bannanas foster. A bit boozey like bourbon but in a well done way.  T- The flavors of the beer are very well done. I am picking up banannas brown sugar and caramel notes. Soft and subtle bourbon notes are present. The beer doesnt have a hint of alcohol in the flavor.   M- The body of the beer is full. The carbonation is light and gentle. A bit of alcohol heat but I think it works well with the beers overall character.  O- This is a very easy to drink beer treat. Well done guys!
NEGATIVE	Straight out of the bottle to a pilsner glass  Appearence: Golden yellow color and almost no head except a slight whitefoam in the middle of the glass   Smell: Smokey grains. This is a very earthy beer. It smells like your traditional german lager but with a great tinge of smokiness to it.   Taste & Mouthfeel: A very smooth taste for a lager. Very crisp and refreshing. The smoke taste is the most dominant. It has a great earthy grain taste. A great blend of a rauchbier and a lager.  Drinkability: This was quite an interesting beer. I'm usually not a lager fan but this one was pretty intriguing. The smokiness added a lot to the beer. More complex than your normal lager. I could see drinking this with some bbq on a summer day.
POSITIVE	A: Curmudgeon sports a red body that is fairly clear save for the sediment that floats in it. Head is creamy in color, and doesn't rely stick around long.  S: malty to the core, the bouquet offers caramel, vanilla, and a touch of rum.  T: flavor follows the bouquet's lead, with heavy vanilla notes followed by caramel and molasses.  M: full bodied and creamy. Carbonation is barely noticeable.  D: a great sipper if there ever was one. This brew shows the oak well, with heavy vanilla notes. This is one of my favorite Old Ales/Barleywines out there.
POSITIVE	12 ounce bottle with bottled on date of 10/2/09 poured into a Founders pint glass.  The Founders Imperial Stout pours a deep chocolate color with a tan head that only pops up after an aggressive pour. Not much lacing or retention to note. Aromas are mostly burnt coffee with a subtle chocolate presence. I'm not picking up any of the 10% abv in the nose. Quaff is sweet licorice with a bitter chocolate finish. Odd that I am not getting consistency with the nose and quaff as I do not notice any espresso or coffee beans in the quaff, or at least nothing like the nose. Mouthfeel is nice and thick like a stout should be. Drinkability is solid for this style mostly in comparison to the high price tag that comes with an Imperial stout.
POSITIVE	A -- A deep reddish amber brew that pours into a one finger head that recedes into a patchy froth and leaves a nice layered lacing.  S -- Citrus rind, mango, apricot, pineapple, subtle malt background.  T -- Earthy, floral hops, citrus rinds, grainy rye character that shows more in a bitterness than a breadiness. Very subtle malts, but still balanced very nicely.  M -- Full bodied and well carbonated, drying yet refreshing.  D -- Yet another solid offering from the brewers at Founders. Well constructed and worth a try.
NEGATIVE	This is a standard Canadian brewpub staple; the beer for the Molsons drinker. No better or worse than dozens of others at your local brewpub; light colour, sweetish finish and limited corn. Avoid if you at all serious about your beer. Try the Siren's Song Pale Ale instead
NEGATIVE	My wife read in a magazine where this was rated fairly high for a light beer (it IS fairly low in calories at 127 per 12 OZ bottle) so I thought I'd give one a try.  a - light body, slightly wimpy head but a nice bright gold color  s - hints of caramel, hops and barley  t - lots of hops in the flavor with a clean finish absent of any bitterness  m - crisp and light with a moderate amount of carbonization  d - these go down pretty easily  In short, this beer is a pretty decent light ale with enough flavor to make you want to drink another, and since the calories and alcohol content are both low, you can in clear conscience.
POSITIVE	Pours a somewhat cloudy deep copper color, with a quite substantial head that lasts a good, long while. There's some chill haze evident.  Nose is a good balance of vegetal hop and sweet malt, lending a "creamy" smell to the beer. There's a slight cheese aroma, but in a good way.  The beer is bitter at first taste, but not overwhelmingly so. This is not a pucker beer, where the insides of each cheek try to get intimately acquainted with every drink. Rather, the bitterness is a smooth, velvety bitterness. It's still bitter, mind you, since it is an IPA, but it's definitely a change of pace from some American IPAs. Since the bitterness is so smooth, it's hard to notice the transition from hop bitterness to malt sweetness. Before you know it, your mouth is saying "what the...?" and the taste you're left with is sweet and creamy. Finally, the sweetness gives way, and that subtle bitterness cames back for the long, slow ride into the sunset. This one is rather subtle for an IPA, to say the least, and damned if that isn't a great thing! There's no "bitter-SWEET-bitter" with this. It's more "bitsweebitter". Very nice.  The mouthfeel, like the flavor, is a bit creamy. A tad thicker than expected, but it just lends itself so well to the taste it's difficult to fault.   This one is very, very well done. For BMC drinkers, it'll be bitter. For full fledged hopheads, they'll wonder what's going on with the transition between hop and malt. For the rest, this is an easy to drink, very well made beer. I'd recommend this to anyone.
POSITIVE	Pours a decent fizzy head of about 1 finger that fades at a med pace with a bit of lacing, over clear reddish slight orange brown color.  Nose is pure smoked malts, a nice smoke though not too overpowering, a bit of a smoked cheese aroma, not much of campfire or anything harsh, just a nice soft smoked gouda like aroma, with a bit of darker wheats and sweet malts behind that, hint of crystal and caramel, and a slight hop character.  Taste starts with more smoke, this time getting a bit more of a smokey smoke, touch of campfire, smoked meats, slight smoked cheese, some sweetness, a bit more darker wheats give it the base with just the slightest hint of fruit, bit of caramel and crystal malts, a slight salty briny taste too. It comes a bit creamy though, with a slight bitterness and just a hint of warming booze. Finishes a bit drier, smoke lingering smoked cheese, a bit more bitterness with a touch of hops and some of the salty smoked malts.  Mouth is medium to slightly bigger bodied, a bit creamy, with decent carbonation and hint of warming booze.  Overall pretty good, drinkable, much more smooth and mild than the Urbock or Marzen I think. Drinkable and nice smoke qualities.
POSITIVE	Poured into a pint glass a very dark almost black color, completely opaque with a 1/2" med brown head. Good lacing and the head had some staying power. Was expecting the burnt malt smell of the Dark Star porter they offer but this was not nearly as strong a smelling beer. More of a heavy roasted smell with a sweet lingering aroma. The taste was a suprise, again roasted malt with a sweet almost fruity flavor and little hop presence. Being a bourbon drinker I really enjoyed the subtle wood tones in this beer. A very well crafted brew and a nice change up from their other porters
POSITIVE	Pours a clear, thick looking amber with a big frothy head.  Pine-hop aroma with wet malt and alcohol, nice.  All piney hop flavor at first. Roasted malt creeps in there and it ends with a punch of piney hop bitterness.   Slick, medium-bodied, medium carbonation.   Solid, very enjoyable IPA (the American variety). For those who love bit hop flavors, this one is worth the price.
NEGATIVE	I'll confess that it's been years since I actually tried this beer. Oddly enough, it was also in Sharm-El-Sheikh as was one of the previous reviews. I have very fond memories of the culture, the people, the food, and even this beer (though it has little to do with the quality of the beer itself).  Without touching too many specifics I'll detail what I do remember. First off, I have no recollection of the head at all. That's not to say that there wasn't one...I just don't remember.  In Egypt, there were two versions of this beer available: "local" and "export." One had a red border on the label, the other blue --- don't remember which was which. Local was almost always better.  I remember that it was golden in color, dry, had a thin mouthfeel, and was highly carbonated. In retrospect, it reminded me a bit of Rolling Rock because it had a sort of "woody" thing going on.   We used to joke that it was much better once the pain in your chest from the first one dissipated. Then again, we imitated Marlon Brando from A Streetcar Named Desire everytime we finished one --- so what did we know. (If you didn't get that, you REALLY need to watch some classic movies.)  The main thing to keep in mind, should you ever venture to Egypt and try this out, is that various environmental/cultural factors make proper storage of beer difficult if not unlikely. You are likely to be served something old and flat --- so if the beer is skunked, order another one from another bar before giving up.   Truly putting the best face possible on America as a whole....some of the guys I was stationed there with had T-shirts made up that said things like "Stella - What doesn't kill us makes us stronger!" and "Stella - Can a million cockroaches be wrong?"   T-shirts and cultural insensitivity aside, it wasn't bad when you got a good one, and it was a full dollar cheaper per bottle than Heineken (the only other thing available to us off-post at the time). I won't say it's worth the trip to Sharm-El-Sheikh just to try this beer, but I will say it's worth drinking one of these for the trip to Sharm-El-Sheikh.
POSITIVE	Picked up a 500 ml bottle in late November from Cost Plus for $3.99.  This brew poured an orange-amber color with a decent white head that is leaving a generous lacing. Nose is of English hops and apples. Taste is of sour apples and finishes with a nice bittering hop. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with a hint of creaminess. Drinkability is good, quite refreshing and sessionable at 4.7 abv.
POSITIVE	Pours a clear orange color with a small white head. A wonderful aroma; rich, super sweet hops, sweet almost honey-like notes. A great flavor as well; smooth but piney bitter hops, sweet and a light citrus too, light bitter pine and light alcohol. Very nice. Too drinkable. This is dangerous.
POSITIVE	Aroma: Smoked meats, molasses, honey, and alcohol in that order. Quite nice. The smoke is evident, but not at all overpowering as it would be easy to do with such a beer. More BBQ than campfire (even though a camp fire is depicted on the label).   Appearance: Jet black with a brown head. Starts thick but settles to a thin brown hat on top of a black tower of beer.   Taste: Much like the aroma. The smoke is very unique. Very BBQ like. I never thought I would use catsup in a beer description (at least in a good way) but there it is, catsup! Of course there are the traditional porter flavors of roast malts and some molasses. Again not overpowering with the smoke but present. Only complaint is that it could be a bit drier.   Palate: Thick, stick to your mouth feel.   Overall: Liquid pork ribs in a bottle but somehow it works. Quite a nice, unique, creative beer. Very appropriate for a St. Louis based brewery (though brewed in WI).
POSITIVE	Poured from a 12oz bottle (bottled on 2/7/11) into a snifter.  A: Pours a beautiful clear amber colour! Very little head, dissapates quickly. Very nice looking beer.  S: Very nice balance of hops, grapefruit & pine with a touch alcohol as it warms.  T: Very similar to the smell, but amplified. Slightly sweet and finishes bitter. Very bold and well balanced. Excellent!  M: Moderate body and carbonation. Lingering hop bitterness.  This is a very nice offering from Founders. Lots of big bold flavors. What you expect from DIPA. They did a great job with this one!
NEGATIVE	Another fine dopplebock that I get to sink my teeth into to. This one I had head good things about so I was most anxious to give it a try. Served at cellar temp and poured into a snifter, this one was consumed on 04/21/2009.  The pour was decent. Caramel in color with a light cloudiness to it. Nothing really outstanding here in the way of look to it as only minimal head rose up and even that faded rather quickly. Aroma was toffee, caramel, and hints of bready malts. A light nut like smell as well as it warms, very sweet though. As I take the first sip it dawns on me that this is very sweet for the style. Lots of caramel here, almost too much. Nice grain bill but it gets lost in the sweetness as it is almost overpowering. Medium body, a little light on the carbonation, but not flat, more syrup like then anything else. Well hidden abv let me put it down quick, though I was less then totally blown away.  Overall while being very solid, I was expecting a bit more. Not as true to the style as I would have liked, but still more then decent. I would have no issue with trying this one again, but I would not seek it out by any means.
POSITIVE	Expecting a gimmick, I was pleasantly surprised with this very good beer. Auburn/copper in colour, with a decent one finger head that lasted. Whisps of lace stick to the glass. Bit of toffee, fruit, malts, earth, grass and caramel in the nose. A rather odd blend that smells pretty damn good. Taste, hmm... Delicious. Lightly sweetened with malts, toffee and fruit, mingling with this down to earth bitterness. Mouthfeel is a bit dry and buttery. However, this is quite the exceptional pale ale and one I shall be buying again.
POSITIVE	.5 L bottle served chilled in a Guinness pint glass (similar shape to the glass on their website)  Appearance: Dark crimson-twinged brown topped by a tiny offwhite head. Beer appeared to be slightly undercarbonated compared to most beers I've seen. The head faded away to a frothy film and ring pretty quickly and left faint specks of lace.  Smell: Very aromatic. Hearty campfire smell is evident from a few feet away. Hickory smoked jerky and caramelized sugars tempt your olfactory senses.   Taste: The smoke and underlying beer tastes are in great balance, moreso than the mrzen. An initial splace of a damn fine bock (sweet caramel malt, buttery notes, light noble hops) that slowly evolves into a robust campfire smoke taste. Jerky-like meat aftertastes.  Mouthfeel: Watery and a bit flat, but I don't believe the bottle was bad at all (though maybe not at 100%). Pleasant and oddly refreshing.  Drinkability: Not as powerful as the mrzen, but I still loved this so. This first sip is the hardest and the rest are pure heaven. I can see why sentimental value kept this brewery alive. Grilling season commences soon.. I best get some more of this stuff.
POSITIVE	Pours a ruby brown in color with no head. Smell is exactly what you'd think, a scotch ale with bourbon, oak, and rum notes. They must have used the same barrels as for their curmudgeon, this has many of the same characteristics. Taste is bourbon, oak, and some fig. The mouthfeel is medium and very smooth/creamy. This is an easy drinker, but you get a hit of the alcohol warmth in the aftertaste.
POSITIVE	A: Amber, with white soapy head. Good amount of lacing.  S: Pretty faint. Some citrus hops, bready, sweet malts.  T: Same as the nose. Nice balance between bittering hops and sweet malts. Finishes bitter.  M: Good carbonation adds a decent amount of substance...especially for a smaller beer.   D: High. Could drink several of these without much trouble.  This would be a great beer to have with a burger or mexican dish...or any other food that makes you poot. Good, refreshing beer.
NEGATIVE	Draft poured into a tulip  A: Pours an opaque, dark red color, solidifying into a mahogany. Some light gets through, but very little. The head is thin but with dense bubbles and is a beautiful purplish pink hue, very unexpected and nice.   S: Aroma is immediately strong with raspberries and tart black cherries, lending obvious credence to its fruit genre.   T/M: Taste follows suit with tart raspberry sweetness and some cherry as well, not as mediciny as Kasteel Rouge but similar otherwise. It has light to medium carbonation with a sweetness that lures you in but a tartness that follows close and fills the entire mouth. Fortunately, the alcohol is well disguised.   Its great after one but more would be overbearing.
POSITIVE	Poured this one into the same pint glass as B.O.R.I.S. and D.O.R.I.S. Looked the same as the non-barrel aged version. Almost no head, which subsided immediately. Very dark brown, clear body.  Aroma was almost the same as B.O.R.I.S. as well. Strong dark malt, strong dark fruits (mainly figs and prunes... should that be dried plums now?) Hops were light. Some tannins were discernable as well.  Taste was different. Tannins were noticeable, as well as surprisingly lighter fruits than the standard version (although some figs were still there). Finish was long, roasted malt. No coffee noticeable.  Mouthfeel was still incredible. Thick, rich, well balanced, and full bodied. But not overly heavy. Amazing.  Great drinkability marks for this one. It went down easily. I could probably do a couple of pints of this without a problem, maybe three given enough time. The quantity in the bottle was just perfect.
POSITIVE	Pours a bright auburn color with a thin lace on the glass. The aroma is of mildly fruity hops and a hint of sweetness. Like the woman on the label, the beer has a great body with a perfectly balanced mild malt and spicy sweet hop balance. Refreshing finish and extremely easy drinking.
NEGATIVE	Pours a golden yellow, hints of orange marmalade color.   Nose of grapefruit and pine and also an assertive "woody" character in the nose.   Mouthfeel is of medium body with nice big flavors of grapefruit skin and pine; also the woody character in the nose carries over to a "woody" flavor both in front and back palate.   Finish is a weak point. Leaves a "soapy" taste in your mouth.   Not a Pike favorite for me but also not something I'd normally drink, in any event, since I almost always drink a higher alcohol brew. Not bad; just not my thing.
NEGATIVE	Black-imitating dark copper. The head is full, plump, and beige. Nose of smoked pork, smoldering wood, and chocolate. Smoke is prevasive from the word go, as it wriggles its way into every nook this offers, but paradoxically it still manages to seem understated with its sizzling pork fat, blackened cedar, and burnbarrels full of fallen leaves. Underneath, coffee grounds and toffee provide the malt contribution, morphing gradually toward chocolate covered apple skins. A faint, but unharmonious rubber note arises late, in the vein of black-smeared pencil erasers. Rides out with tendrils of smoke and a fattened chocolate notion. Lightish bodied, cohering slightly richer as it sits awhile. As is, it strandles the indifference fence: too light for true experience, and marred ever-so-slightly. This would be still be well suited to wash down like-minded foods, but enjoyment in and of itself suffers.
POSITIVE	From the man known as Masterski. Thanks for looking out for me Alex.  A: Pours a nice rich black hue with an nice tan head. Nice retention and some nice sheets of lace.  S: Aromas of roasted malt, chocolate, char, and grassy green hops.  T: Very bold roast just short of char. Grassy hops and loads of chocolate malt. Hints of coffee and a bit of toffee. Light ash with a bit of citrus.  M: On the fuller side of body, rich and smooth. The hops are still present without being too bitter. Boldly roasted from start to finish.  D: Good I like it. I want more to age a bit.
POSITIVE	This IPA is just a bit different for me. The smell is very "light" and is of citrus and hops, floral. This is where it get good. It's not the heavy citrus or typical IPA taste. Taste starts bitter and ends bitter. There is a strong malt flavor with just a hint of citrus in there. It has a very dry finish and very smooth to drink. The light carbonation is perfect. By no means is this the best but I really enjoy it cause it is a bit different.
NEGATIVE	12 oz bottle poured into a tulip. pours a hazy caramel brown color with two fingers of slow settling tan head that is quite tight and has excellent retention (about ten minutes).  aroma is packed with hops, giving the overall brew a floral and lightly coniferous character. light caramel malt is discernable, but is mainly drowned out by the hops.  taste is very rich on the palate, with the same light caramel malt and a blast of hops at the back of the palate. there is a harsh tickle in the throat on the way down, along with a palate killing hop quality that does not subside.  mouthfeel is quite bitter and hoppy, with a dry finish that leaves the palate sticky with residual hops.  drinkability is decent. there are only so many hops that one can throw into a brew without allowing the character to get so saturated that the flavors themselves are discounted in the name of the hops, and this one broke the threshold quite a few sips ago. that being said, the richness and blast of hops is enough to cover up the 13% APV, which is a notable achievement.
POSITIVE	half a 12 Oz poured into a Duvel goblet.  A: Poured a thick cloudy butterscotch/amber color. There was very little head, and thin lacing. Although if I hadnt shared the bottle Im sure a better pour would have yielded slightly more head  S: Good lord. . . HOPS!! Bitter, intense, beautiful hops! My first smell almost knocked me onto my seat. A small amount of malt present, but definitely dominated by the hops.  T: Again, it is almost all in the hops! Tons and tons of hops. This has to be the most straightforward hops Ive ever tasted, short of the time I chewed a hop pellet.  M: Medium body with slight effervescence.  D: Mmmm. Yes I will have another. And another. Just not tonight.
POSITIVE	green cap poured into a sam adams glass. poured the standard dark espresso you'd expect from a stout with minimal head that left little lacing.  not too much bourbon smell before sipping but during and after the sip the bourbon stands out in just the right amount. this has an almost perfect balance of malt, hops and bourbon for what i was expecting.   it is just sweet enough to give my mouth a pucker and desire another drink almost immediately. surprisingly this doesn't have a huge alcohol smell or taste making this one dangerous in the wrong, or right, circumstance.  i have a few hoppin frogs in my cellar and this was the first one i cracked open since i was screwed by my local store on my Canadian Breakfast Stout. glad i have two more of these and one regular Boris ready for the winter.
NEGATIVE	I found this at Jungle Jim's in Fairfield so I though it was time to give it a try. 12 ounce stubby bottle with an old man on the front.  A: Pours murky red with brown highlights. No foam buld-up on the initial pour but after the pour, small bubbles came to the top leaving a tan ring and dotted lacing.  S: Smelled of bready yeasts, sweet malts, light cinammon, bananna, vanilla, caramel and a bit of mustiness.  T: Full flavored blast of sweet, caramelized malts - Malts all over the place followed by subdued flavors including spice, bananna and vanilla. Slight warming alcohol becomes present after allowing the beer to warm to room temperature.  M: Full bodied and oily. Finshes very wet with the slightest amount of bitterness and low carbonation.  Interesting and enjoyable. Good example for the style.
POSITIVE	Brewed under license in ... somewhere. The situation for Amstel in South Africa seems to be quite complicated.   The colour is pale gold; the finger thick head is compact and white. Some lacing occurs.  The smell is sweet with some flowery notes. I also found fresh bitter and somewhat hoppy flavours.   The taste got mild notes of fresh wheat bread, a fine crisp clean bitterness (maybe a bit too anonymous). The aftertaste is very fresh and refreshing with hints of dough and bitter hops (with a touch of mint).   The carbonation is quite powerful, the liquid is smooth for a lager.  A good example of the Eurolager style.
POSITIVE	Hazy red-orange copper colored with an initial half in of medium bubbled foam that dissipates to a light layer and ring that last to the bottom of the glass. Aroma is sweetly malty with plenty of hops. The taste is not as sweet as the aroma. This is more of a dry bitter flavor. Mouthfeel is full and the carbonation feels prickly. This is a good tasting beer and I will be including it in my regular rotation.  Edit: The original review was done as a stand alone to give every consideration to the beer but I would like to add that when drinking this beer with a curry dish that also had massive amounts of red pepper it cut through just fine and complimeted the meal very well.
POSITIVE	12oz bottle into a pint glass  A: Pours a dark black with a medium dark brown head that fades to a ring and leaves no real lacing. Almost looks like an Imperial...  S: The nose is full of cocoa/chocolate and that's about it...pretty one dimensional but it smells great..  T: The taste is much different. The cocoa is up front but there's a hop presence in there as well that's kind of piney.   M: The feel is slightly creamy with a nice medium to full body.   D: Very solid brew with a decent ABV. I'd buy it if I could get it.
NEGATIVE	A 500ml bottle with a BB of March 2012. Label states the ABV as 4.1%. Brewed to commemorate the Six nations rugby tournament.  Poured into a Sam Smith's glass. A clear golden-amber colour with good carbonation. Produces a large head of white foam that lasts for a minute or two before subsiding. Aroma of sweetish malt with some notes of caramel and yeasty esters.  Tastes of caramel malt with a dry, mildly bitter finish. Notes of caramel/toffee and hints of esters, accompanied by a harsh stewed leaf character upon swallowing. Slightly watery. Mouthfeel is smooth but has considerable astringency. Aftertaste of stewed leaves.  Not an enjoyable beer - it's both dull and has an unpleasant flavour. I won't be having this again, and couldn't recommend it to anyone else either.
NEGATIVE	Of all the big 40 oz. high gravity beer, this one is king. The taste is good compared to the other 40 ounce choices out there. Drink alot of water when drinking or a major headache occurs. Has been known to make a person a mean drunk. So drink with caution. A legend among urban youths.Taste better than it smells. Hold your breath
NEGATIVE	Deep amber color with no head whatsoever. Attractive piney and citrusy hop aromas. Minimal carbonation. Taste is primarily hoppy with grapefruit notes, but the hop profile isn't very aggressive, and with little in the way of discernible malts to balance, this brew comes off as very one-dimensional and unassertive.
POSITIVE	This beer pours a light amber color giving off an almost orange hue when held up to the light. The head is a nice light kaki color and an agressive pour give a good 2-3 finger head.  It has a nice crisp grapefruit aroma just as a good american IPA should. I also get a hint of a sweet malt in the aroma as it warms but the hops are the big attraction is this beer.  The flavor has a great floral and citrusy hop presence held up by a nice light malt back bone. The bitterness is just at that threash hold.   The moughtfeel is a little dry from the bitterness but that is what makes this beer crisp.   Great beer and very drinkable. Just the right amount of flavor and not too strong at 7.2%.
NEGATIVE	Served into pint glass. Golden amber in color. good two inch head to begin with that fades fairly quickly. Lacing stays throughout the experience. Fruity esters are noticed upon smelling. somewhat dry in flavor, hints of fruitiness and acidity. clean mouthfeel. I couldn't see myself buying this again, but definitely earns the title worth a try. One of the more enjoyable beers you can find anywhere
POSITIVE	This poured a very nice deep red with a nice fluffy head that had good retention, and left nice lacing on the glass. There were also quite a few carbonation bubbles to look at. The smell was that of rye and breadiness. There were also notes of cirtus, grapefruit, and some malty toastiness. This beer was nice and hoppy with a nice amount of bitterness. I thought this was a nicely balanced beer. The taste also included some citrus, nice amount of rye, and some lemon zest. The mouthfeel was good. It coated the mouth nicely, and had a medium body with nice carbonation. The drinkability was good as well. I think I could keep drinking these all night. I really enjoyed this beer. Another fine Founders beer. Keep up the good work guys. Cheers.
POSITIVE	Light orange appearance, too frothy of a head almost. Aroma, bitter, not particularly hoppy, sweetness.  Taste, very bitter, again, lacking hop mouthfeel to the bitterness. Smoothes itself out after a few drinks, hop mouthfeel comes out a little bit, more to the grapefruit side if anything. Malt bill low, alcohol seems to be too detectable for being under 6%. Seems like a long hop boil.   Nice price ($5) makes this one a little more drinkable. Standard PacNW ipa fare for the most part, which means its good.
NEGATIVE	Bottle c/o drabmuh. Thanks Matt!  A: Orange hue with amber highlights. Moderate white head that leaves a fair amount of lacing on the glass.  S: Sweet malt with hop scents in the background. It also smells of spices, like a spiced seasonal ale.  T: Spices and malt foremost, with hops trailing behind. A decent brew. A bit too sweet, though not terribly so. This is more malt heavy than I would prefer to taste in an APA. Why is there such a prevalent spice aroma and taste in an American Pale Ale? I understand pushing the boundaries, but I'm just not feeling this one.  M: Medium bodied. Slightly odd aftertaste of sweet malts and spices.  D: I wouldn't want to drink this in quantity. A valiant effort, but a blunder nonetheless. Mediocre.
NEGATIVE	I received this as an extra in a recent trade. Review is from notes taken on 1/11/2011 and poured from the bottle to a pint glass.  Appearance: Pour is a very solid copper; starts with a 1/2 finger head that is slightly off-white and it fades quickly to a large island of an incomplete skim with a thin ring around the surface; body is just a little bit hazy and it shows moderately strong carbonation;  Smell: Smell is a bit of dry graininess, some sweet powdery malt and just a touch of citrus that is reminiscent of lemon zest.  Taste: The taste really matches the smell, very close to a "T" -- a lot of sweet maltiness that reminds me of some amber extract that I've used in some batches; definite dry and slightly toasty graininess; ends with a faint hop presence that has a bit of the lemony zest to it, but the aftertaste reverts to the sweet malt.  Mouthfeel: Body is between light and medium, but definitely leaning towards the light; carbonation is strong and borderline sharp, but it fits the style well and isn't overbearing or anything; a thin sticky coating is left on the roof of the mouth and it holds the sweetness on the palate a bit.  Drinkability: All in all, it's a pretty solid meat and potatoes kind of beer -- nothing special, but certainly tasty enough to warrant picking it up when the chance is presented on an annual basis (kind of reminds me a bit of GLBC Conway's); decent set of flavors and a very light ABV would allow this to be drank, but it's nothing that screams "DRINK ME."
NEGATIVE	A 12 ounce bottle poured into a shaker glass. The ale appears a rather dark brown color with about two fingers of ecru foam. Flavor and aroma are of the inside of a smokehouse. Smokey, sweet, slightly pungent, smoked meats such as ham, beef jerky, pleasantly bitter, decent malt sweetness. Medium to full bodied with adequate carbonation for a porter. Overall, a well made smoked beer that all fans of the style need to try.
POSITIVE	Nice creamy head, thin but lovely and lasting. Perfectly smooth on the dark brown/mahogany color body. I can't really tell for the smell, as people were smoking in the place (maybe some sweet red fruits, slightly chocolaty). The taste was milky showing roasted but sweet cofee. Wooden, with some red fruits, and a fruitiness of something green, maybe apples. A chewy hop profile, citric and grassy. Orange peel. Liquorice and cloves. Light enjoyable notes of alcohol, more noticeable than the actual alcohol content would make you expect. The mouthfeel is creamt, round and smooth, yet not too heavy, thus drinkable for the style. Smooth like chocolate, sweet and almost winy. An interesting combination of flavors.
POSITIVE	*Note: I am not a huge Imperial Stout fan but I have been wanting to try this one for a while...  A- Pours a jet black motor oil style body with a creamy coffee colored foam head that leaves some good lacing.  S- Wow...this is one of the best/most aromatic coffee noses that I have ever come across. Roasted coffee (java or mocha?) and sweet chocolate scents completely dominate the nose. A light toasted malt and oatmeal can be detected as well. I could sit here smelling this all day. I wonder if Founders and Glade would team up to make a Breakfast Stout air freshener?  T- A huge rush of coffee taste initially with a roasted/burnt flavor of cocoa and bittersweet chocolate. A sweet malt backbone helps to balance the bitterness of the cocoa and coffee (definitely not a hoppy bitterness). Toasted flavors of grain and oatmeal are more apparent with warming. A fairly substantial alcohol presence can be detected as well.  M- Big and bold with a full body and velvety smooth feel. Medium/low carbonation but it works well with the style.   D- This is a palate smasher of a stout with tons of roasted coffee and chocolate flavors. The alcohol is fairly noticeable and turns this into a sipping beer. A fantastic brew that won't easily turn into a session.
POSITIVE	Hazy pale straw color. Light carbonation with small bubbles that form a tight white rim on the glass. Nice floral, citrus, zesty, grassy/herbal aroma. Hop flavor is strong and complex but balanced with the malt backbone of this beer. Clean malty flavor with good hop flavor and bitterness as expected in a 2xIPA. Noticed hop flavors include grapefruit, citrus and pine. Medium light to medium body that finishes dry with a nice malty sweet and herbal lingering bitterness. Not a harsh beer - rather an intensely hoppy, very strong pale. Nice beer.
NEGATIVE	A: Poured clear with a nice thick white head that disappeared quickly.   Smell: Sweet, but nothing that stands out.  Taste: Sweet with a little bit of hops  Moutherfeel: Clean with an ok amount of carbonation.   Drinkability: It's ok, but nothing crazy.  This beer is just average. This is something I would share with friends if I had on hand, but I don't know if I would recommend it.  I am kind of shocked to have found this beer in Mississippi.
NEGATIVE	Served in a standard pint glass. Appearance isn't too exciting to me, rather clear and almost flourescent lookind when placed in front of the light, decent foamy head. The taste is a pretty average pilsner flavor, not very exciting for my taste. Mouthfeel isn't too bad, fairly smooth going down. I can see myself drinking a few of these beers if I had no good alternatives. Definately better than the average boring macro pilsner though.
POSITIVE	Picked up a growler at the brewery.  A: Cloudy yellowish orange with minimal head and no lacing.  S: Strong smell of bananas and wheat. Some clove. Fruity and sweet.  T: Tastes like husky wheat with a compliment of sweet banana. Flavorful and refreshing.  M: Not as heavy as it looks. Light and bubbly. I would like to see the body a little more mellow.  D: Very very drinkable. Particularly on a hot summer day a sixer of this can go quickly. One of my favorite offerings from the hometown brewery.
POSITIVE	Appearance: golden color , just a bit of chill haze , and about a half inch of white foam.  Smell: malty , hint of golden raisin, maybe... tomato or v8 aroma?  Taste: a nice , soft , malty taste to this brew. Starts off with a slightly sweet , almost raisin like taste , then more bicuity malt moves in , some weird vegetable taste- kinda like tomatoes , and just a bit of balancing dry hop.  Mouthfeel: medium bodied and very soft.  Drinkability: quite drinkable , would definatly be a good session brew. There is a bit of a wierd vegie flavor in there to me , but it grew on me as i quaffed.
NEGATIVE	Presentation: Friday 9th April, 2004 was spent in Binche, Belgium, the home of Brasserie La Binchoise. Sadly our planned trip to both the Brewery and on-premises Tavern proved fruitless thanks to the fact that it was closed.  After a few beers in the nearby Du Cte De Chez Boule our small party headed into the main square. Here we sampled some brews at La Chamade whilst looking at the many pictures of the Carnival that adorns the walls. La Binchoise Rose des Ramparts was the first and was from the Bottle.  Appearance: Arrived in a clear glass bottle that had been already opened. The Waitress looked at us as if we were out of our minds and wasnt sure if she should leave the Glasses that were on her tray or not. Surely if we knew we ordered this we wouldnt need Glasses right? A group of adults drinking flavored soda-pop fruit beer will need Glasses though? What we go through for a new experience. Darkish cloudy purple color with a little flamingo pink head that fizzes away to a quick death and leaves a flat looking cranberry plum juice offering. Looks Sad.  Nose: Uuargh. Raspberry syrup meets fizzy pale ale. Sickly Framboise-wannabe that is one-dimensional. Enough to make all of our party wary before we even sampled this one.  Taste: Oh my, much worse than the smell  and thats saying something. Raspberry Ripple Ice-Cream meets Billy No Testicles at the Eunuchs Ball. Simply awful. I cannot repeat what my notes say but there are at least two F-words and one that begins with Sh.  Mouthfeel: Sickly sweet and sticky. Raspberry juices mixed into a Soda based Amber Ale. Scrape this one of your cheeks before the next brew.  Drinkability: I finished it, just, there was no way I was going to let the Waitress think that she was right! LOL. Im sure this is very drinkable if you are 12 years old.   Overall: We should have known from the shocked look of the Waitress that served us the Rose des Remparts that this drink is not for grown Men. Oh how right she was. Shockingly awful. Low grade Alco-Pops are officially now available in Belgium from one of the strangest and least likely sources it seems.  Described by the Brewery as a Raspberry-flavored with very soft taste. This summer session, light and refreshing beer appeals to women and young drinkers. Yep, thats about it!! Its for Jessies and Kids is this one!
POSITIVE	Yeah its a Moses Malone rating, but this is good stuff.   Pours a light straw colour with a very nice fluffy white head that looks like new clean snow. Aroma is a bit grassy, with a touch of biscuit. Taste is crisp with light biscuity malt upfront with nice crisp dryinging hops at the end. The finish is crisp with a bit of bitter and cleansing notes. Mouthfeel is Very nice with good carbonation that cleanses the palate. Drinkability is high. Even though i sampled this in the winter, I can imagine that this would be a perfect summer quencher.   I had written Stoudt's off, but their new line up and tweaking has produced two great beers. This one and the sublime Double IPA
POSITIVE	a: This was a very pale, clear golden color. It was served to me with craggy, sticky head that stuck around for awhile.  s: Big piney hop nose with a little lemon.  t: This tasted very fresh. Sweet flavors of toffee and then a big piny hop blast at the end.  m: Fabulous carbonation, long lasting. Perfect.  d: One of the best IPAs I've tried. Great stuff.
POSITIVE	The brew is clear amber, an off-white rather small head, some lacing and some curtains.  The smell is clearly smoky, a bit of tar and peat, some wood. Very much like a traditional wood sauna.  Upfront sweet, brown sugar, sweet bread, smoked meat, sweet sour bitter nuances (mango chutney?).  Low carbonation, soft and oily, a rather dry finish.  A pleasant moderated rauchbier.
POSITIVE	12 oz Stubby bottle.  9.4% ABV 86 IBU's Pours hazed, lighter golden amber, light tan head, creamy and leaves spotty bits of fine lace. Grapefruit hops in the pungent nose. Fresh and enticing to my hop loving nostrils and palate. Grapefruit, and more grapefruit on the tongue, soft and sanguine. Here is a somehow slinky, and sophisticated yet all the while hop crushing DIPA. Enjoyed every sip of this one from the talanted brewers of Founders.
NEGATIVE	Draught at The Rover in Gotheburg, Sweden. Clear amber color. Thich white head, long lasting. Distinct malty scent. Low bitterness, medium body. Balanced flavor with a mix of malt and hops. Fairly easy to drink, but a bit more bitterness than the ordinary light lager. Fruity and bitter aftertaste.
NEGATIVE	6 pack of double IPA on sale for about 7 bucks, how do you turn that down?   Pours a thick cloudy ruby orange color. Thin head with marginal lacing is left in the glass. Looks rather thick for 8%.  This one has a lot of malt in the mix. Strong caramel malt with a lot of citrus and tropical fruits. There's a certain grainy and sweet element here that's a touch over the top for me.  Hops bite the tongue, strong citrus blend pours down the gullet, but there is a certain element to this much like all other BBC ipas that I don't like.  Easy drinker here, but the flavors keeps me from enjoying it.  This is a good deal, it isn't bad, and it can certainly help when you have a hop fix in need of fixing! That said I'll spend the extra money for some of the better IPAs and double IPAs more often than not.
POSITIVE	Pours a midnight black with a very thin tan head that leaves little lacing in my Duvel tulip glass.  Smell is strong whiskey, chocolate, vanilla, coffee, Wow a really nice smell to this one.  Taste is whiskey, chocolate, vanilla, coffee with a strong alcohol presence.  A very good barrel aged stout, with a strong whiskey presence. Worth seeking out and trying.
NEGATIVE	Very dark inky brown marker. A mocha head fades quickly into a powdery top.   Vanilla and roasty dark malts. Coffee and caramel aromas. Dark fruits and a slight hoppy aromatic.   A very fine vanilla porter. Not overly sweet with vanilla and well integrated with the coffee and roasty malt character. Vanilla adds a nice layer of complexity. Coffee, caramel, burnt figs and a of a toffee in the middle. Rich and full of chocolate and hints of black tea.
POSITIVE	Hazy orange copper body. Thin bubbly beige head. Lace is sparse. Beautiful smokey nose. Hate to say it again, but like a distant campfire. Or actually, not so distant. Oaky and greasy. I love it. This beer is fantastic. Nobody does Rauchbier like Schlenkerla. And I mean nobody. I can't believe how easy this goes down for an 8% beer. The richness of a dopplebock isn't quite where I was expecting it, but the flavor is delicious. Malts are pretty rich and the smokiness is complex and soothing. Very slightly phenolic, which adds a dimension, and also slightly oily and bitter. Awesome beer.
POSITIVE	On tap at Bulls Head Public House, Lititz, PA  A: Looks fantastic. Super dark, with a thin, dense tan head.  S: heavily roasted malts, coffee, with a hint of chocolate  T: Super Rich Coffee flavor that just washes over your pallet. Follows up with a strong Chocolate Milk flavor that quickly transitions into the alcohol warmth/balancing hop bitterness. This is seriously well balanced and really, really delicious.  M: Really creamy, and what all good stouts should be  D: Yeah, I can only have one at a shot, but this is the stuff. Right up there with the Sam Smith Oatmeal Stout's, or St. Peter's Cream Stouts of the world.
NEGATIVE	Tried a Cucapa awhile ago, didn't love it. Figured I'd try the pale ale, since the last one I had was pretty malty.  Appearance- A rich amber color. A full inch of tan head, laces very nicely. It's a little cloudy. The deep red color doesn't really say "pale ale" to me, but it's acceptable in the English style.  Smell- Rich and malty. Definitely buttery. Some earthy hops as well.   Taste- Sweet malt. Buttery (can't get over that), slightly nutty. Some earthy hops. Sweet, but with a lingering burnt caramel.  Mouthfeel- Pretty rich.   Drinkability- Not for me. Too much butteriness, sweetness, etc.  Yep, this was the same beer I disliked last time. I really want to like craft from Mexico, but this isn't the one for me.
NEGATIVE	Glowing candy apple red infused with a generous amount of juicy orange. This is a pretty typical hue for a winter warmer... and a gorgeous one. Too bad the khaki colored crown barely reached two fingers. It looks decent, though, and is capable enough in the glass decoration department.  If you like spiced beer, then you'll enjoy the nose immensely. Cinnamon and nutmeg are front and center, while ginger stays in the shadows. It smells like the base beer will be enjoyable too. There's only one way to find out...  Frosted Frog is definitely heavy on spices. More so than two of Ohio's other Christmas brews (Great Lakes Christmas Ale and Thirsty Dog 12 Dogs of Christmas). Even though it may prove to be too much over the course of the bomber, it sure is tasty stuff in the first several ounces.  The base beer tastes caramel and Munich malty, with a toasted bread-like, nutty, earthy quality. The sweetness is right on the money and only 12 IBUs means that hop flavor and bitterness are at a low ebb. Alcohol keeps things firm and gently warming, with a slight medicinal edge.  Cinnamon and nutmeg are still rompin' and stompin' all over the damn place. This is good beer, but it might be best to drink it with hearty food. Sharing the bottle isn't a bad idea either. I'm now at mid-bomber and the cumulative nature of the spice load is beginning to wear my palate out like a rented mule.  The mouthfeel is medium-full and is stainless steel smooth. The buzzsaw of spices and the high ABV keep it from being pampering, though it easily earns the above score in the end. Well-buried bubbles help.  Hoppin' Frog Frosted Frog Christmas Ale is a solid X-mas brew that is at least as good as this brewery's other seasonal, Frog's Hollow Double Pumpkin Ale. It isn't as good as Great Lakes Brewing Company's classic, but it's definitely worth a single bomber purchase every holiday season.
NEGATIVE	Poured from an 11.2 ounce bottle into a cervoise glass.  Appearance: Highly carbonated. Yellow-tinged off white head. Hazy golden body.  Smell: Green apples and doughy yeast. Kind of reminds me of a Unibroue beer.  Taste: Tart green apples and yeast. Unmistakably Belgian. Yeast lasts on the tastebuds and gives some spicy herbal notes in the aftertaste.
NEGATIVE	Sampled at the Clockwork Beer Company.  Pours a straw gold with a few bubbles around the edge of the glass. No lacing no speak of. Some faint biscuity malts in the nose but there isn't a whole lot there. Nice biscuity malt leading to a mild hoppy finish in the tasting. Some slight citrusy and peppery notes I detect. Surprisingly carbonated for a cask lager. Nice. Drinkable most certainly, but I would prefer something a little more exciting than this.
POSITIVE	Pours copper with a rich off-white head. Trailing lace nearly covers the glass.  The smell is of pine, herbal spicing, some medicinal notes, perfumy, with orange and grapefruit. A nice, complex hop aroma!  The taste is of an herbal, aspirin-ish, bitterness with grapefruit and orange. Alcohol comes through in a peppery way. Slight metallic (steely) notes accompany the caramel backing.   Medium-bodied.   This is a nicely done, hoppy IPA, even for the style, with a solid caramel backing. Despite slight metallic/steely notes and slight show of the abv, this one disappears "too" quickly and is certainly worth seeking out if you're a follower of the hops! A nice IPA in a can - I'm a happy man!
POSITIVE	12oz. bottle poured dark brown/black with large tan foam cap with good retention that leaves spots of lace around the glass. Smells of floral hops with a light bread aroma. The rye is the first thing in the taste I notice along with a grassy hop flavor and some dark roasted malt. The feel has a slight tingle of carbonation and is light/medium bodied. This is a very tasty and drinkable brew from Founders and I'm finding their beers to be some of my favorites and I can't wait for them to be available in my area.
POSITIVE	"You either love this style of beer, or you hate it".  (*wink, wink, Inebrius).  If the marzen was Tommy Chong, than this is Cheech.  The fuller, more rounded, and generally more likeable partner.  Don't get me wrong, the marzen was great as well.  This is just legendary. Lucious deep garnet in color.  Medium beige head has some stick to it.   Lovely smoky aroma.  Meaty, woody and just sultry.  Seems a little more subdued than the marzen, but probably because there are more aromas to contend with.  Malty bock notes are noticed, with fruity and chocolate hues.   What truly stands out in the taste is how well crafted of a bock this is.  Smoke aside, this would stand by itself as a great example.  Large amounts of dark fruit (plum, prune) sweetness, with maybe a touch of sweet apple.  Chocolate is a big time player here as well.  Smoke integrates wonderfully, and never overpowers, it just adds some autumnal, woody, campfire notes.   Velveteen mouthfeel.  It skates across the tounge.  Low, but steady carbonation ensures the silkiness lasts the duration.   Probably the most drinkable rauch (or smoked beer) I've had.  It is as easy to guzzle as it is to savor.   Udderly delightful.
NEGATIVE	A standard English pale. Very decent hoppy and barley aroma. A bit light on taste but goes down well with food. Satisfying but nothing extraordinary. Understated bitterness and a great big head. Light body colour and mouthfeel. Dry and somewhat bitter aftertaste.
NEGATIVE	Drank from the can on the way to Dubrovnik.  A: Can looks like some sort of cheap soda. Pouring it into a small cup it's a bright clear pale.  S: Kind of soury. Touch of grain. Not much else.  T: Very watery. Hint of some sort of grain maybe and a light sweetness. This is almost exactly like a Bud Light.  Though a good use of my last very few Bosnian markas (with some leftover pocket change in the town of Neum), this is not something I would look for anywhere else. Best beer from region comes from Bosnia
NEGATIVE	22oz bottle poured into a tulip.  Pours a crystal clear amber with some bubbles streaming to the top feeding a huge creamy beige head that shows excellent retention and lacing.  Huge, huge pithy grapefruit aroma with some juicy sweetness and hints of resinous pine and floral aromas. Light pale malt sweetness underneath but not enough to even think about balancing the hops.  Speaking of unbalanced, this is a seriously bitter-tasting hop bomb of a beer. There's no hint of malts in the taste, just a huge massively bitter citrus hop taste up front that almost tastes metallic. The finish has a lingering sticky hop aftertaste that just blasts the palate.  The mouthfeel is medium to full bodied and sticky, thick and sticky, with bitterness from start to finish.  This is a decent beer whose taste doesn't live up to the aroma for me. I thought the juicy citrus was going to come out, but the taste was just an overpowering bitterness that didn't have the flavors I was hoping for. Hop bomb.
POSITIVE	A: Black with a chocolate ice cream colored head. Large foamy head forms to begin with and quickly dies down to a thin film that floats on top of the brew's surface. Lower head retention probably due to the high abv, or a glass that wasn't cleaned properly.  S: Wow! There is such a huge amount of aroma coming out of this brew. Coffee is definitely the star of the show, though hints of chocolate and crystal malts also make an appearance.  T:Simply amazing. One of the best stounts I've ever had the privilege to drink. Definite coffee and chocolate flavors are present, as well as chocolate, roasted malt, and crystal malt. This is fantastic.  M: It was a great idea to put oatmeal in this brew. I feel oatmeal gives beer on of the most amazing textures ever. Breakfast Stout has a huge body with a velvety finish. Perfectly carbonated. The beer seems to dance around on your tongue.  D: I will definitely be picking up some more of this. Tasty & enjoyable. Not a session beer, but a great on to start out the night (or morning =D )
POSITIVE	Bottle (courtesy of Hogtownharry): Poured a deep hazy amber color ale with a huge slightly off white foamy head with excellent retention. Aroma of citrus hops is clearly detectable but nice semi-sweet malt presence provides good balance. Taste is also quite strong on citrus hops with nice malt base. Body is above average and I really enjoyed the low filtration level.
NEGATIVE	Pours a nicely sized head. Color is a golden, clear yellow.   Smell is very floural, with a clear hops presence.  First sip is pleasently hoppy. A bit of a honey flavor is present as well.   Mouthful is a bit watery, but for a beer with an ABV at this one's level it is expected.  A pretty good beer.
POSITIVE	A- Poured from the tap with a nice 1/4" high cream-colored head, which was resonably retained throughout the drink, slowing giving way to some nice bits of lacing.  S- Smells of candied nuts and earthy noble hops, with some restrained caramel aromas kicking around in the background.  T- Perfect replicate of the nose- Sweet nutty flavors, some earthy hops, and some hints of caramel. Finishes long, dry and *slightly* bitter.  M- Thin body... but not flimsy. Spritzy with some moderately coarse carbonation. Doesn't feel over-attenuated.  D- Wow. This is the first time I've EVER ordered the same beer 3 times in a row at my local watering hole! I guess this means that it's drinkable!
POSITIVE	Appearance: Deep honey amber gold with a white effervescent head leaves thick broad patches of lacing down my pint, this was on draft at Mad Mex 2.75 for a pint during happy hour can't beat that. Aroma: Strong upfront sweetness some mild hops with underlying fruit tones, can't detect much spiciness. Taste: Not overly sweet veryt smooth some fruity undertones not bad at all. Mouthfeel: Medium body slightly syrupy texture with fine carbonation making this one incredibly easy to consume. Drinkability: Not the most unique tripel or authentic compared to some of my favorite Belgian represenations, but this one stands up and serves a great flavor that is very respectable.
NEGATIVE	A: Straw yellow colored body, 1 finger head displays decent retention and some lacing.  S: Noble hops are dominant, also some sweet malt in there.  T: Sweet malts with the crisp noble hop finish, a nice clean flavor.  M: Very light and refreshing, easy drinking german pilsner. Medium to high carbonation.   O: Very drinkable pils, certainly not the best, nothing unique here.. but I'd have a few.
POSITIVE	Poured from a 22 oz bottle into a crystal wine glass- pours a very dark brown/charcoal bordering on black; impenetrable by light except around the edges. There was almost no head when poured; it retains a trace amount of foam and lacing. The smell is faint- at first it smells only slightly of dark malt but I noticed a hint of oatmeal after a few seconds. It tastes of dark malt and molasses up front and then the slight bitterness of coffee towards the end. Only as an aftertaste did I notice any sign of the 9.4 percent abv. This brew is thick and syrupy but with a nice light carbonation to keep it drinkable. This is an excellent Imperial stout and definitely worth a try.
POSITIVE	Bottle Inspection: Gives abv (8.3%) and description as "double coffee chocolate oatmeal"  Aroma: I get whiffs from a good 4 feet away! Great blend of coffee, deep roasted grains, and a ribbon of hop goodness. Yeah, that's the stuff.  Appearance: Poured like liquid evil, slow and black as tar. A firm drop in the last bit trying to raise a head showed a brief flash of deep tan froth that slipped quickly back into the ooze from whence it came. My mug looks like a black hole. Bright light showed about a millimeter of clear black that a few carbonation bubbles could be seen, but not else. Stuff looks freakin' great!  Flavor: Burnt coffee bitter is quickly soothed by slightly sweet roasted malt base and dark chocolate. The flavor is simple but delicious. The back end has a wet hop light bitter to give the beer a wonderfully round profile.   Mouthfeel: Medium heavy body, slick oatmeal texture, minimal carbonation. It quickly soaks into your chops to leave a dry, but lasting flavor.  Overall Impression: Wow. Deep, rich, simple, tasty: all the flavors both stand out and compliment each other in wonderful ways. A heck of a way to start a day!  Undying thanks to a most generous and upstanding BA: mattcrill.
NEGATIVE	poured into a dokel, deep brown with a reddish hue, little head. exactly what I expected it to look like.  smell is so rich in smoked pork, the best way to describe is to say it smells like liquid bacon.   taste is rich smoke, salty pork or bacon. rich malt is the backbone for the smokey presence. no hops to speak of in the taste. Absolutely remarkable.  mouth is suprisingly clean, maybe slightly dry. Drinks really really slow. It might take me a while to finish this one. but Damn it's a good beer. I'm thinking it would be good to make a chili or Ham and Beans with.
POSITIVE	Pours a beautiful hazy amber hue with a rather thin off-white head. I can smell as I pour. I get huge scents of citrus, pine, sweet caramel malt. There is no doubt this beer had been dry-hopped. This is one of the better IPAs I've smelled. The first taste brings on big tastes of grapefruit and resinous pine, and then it backs off and then the sweet malt rounds everything out. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation. I do not detect any alcohol in the mouthfeel. The drinkability on this beer is very good. Not quite a session able beer at 7.2%, but it still holds up well.   Quintessential IPA. Well done Founders!
POSITIVE	A- Appearance is your typical good looking stout, dark brown just about black body with a creamy coffee colored head.  S- Lots of roasted coffee grinds some vanilla brown sugars and honey.  T- Sweetness from the syrup and acidic bitterness from the coffee intermingle with each other. Maple syrup plays a more supporting role I would have liked to see more of it than the coffee being that Ive had the coffee experience with FBS and KBS.  M- Really creamy probably the creamiest brew Ive had slithering across my tongue.  O- Excellent brew. Worth skipping work or paying some crazy premium? My palette says no, the taste just does not match up to the hype for me.
POSITIVE	Pours a cloudy dark amber with a 1 finger off-white head that leaves a ton of lacing.  Smells of cognac soaked dates, hops and caramel.   First taste is initially quite strong - but this came right after some Belgian pales. Lots of piny hops - with a definite dose of citrus in there. Caramel and toffee. Dates & prunes. Some liquor. This is a strong beer, for sure, with lots of flavors going on. All in all, I'm enjoying this.  Mouthfeel is very rich with a definite alcohol presence.  Drinkability I rate as decent for what it is.  Overall, I quite enjoyed this. It's strong, alcoholic and thick, but the taste still keeps me coming back.  Edit: Got to up the drinkability a bit. I crave this beer every once in a while, so that's got to say something.
POSITIVE	This is one hell of an opaque beer, with minimal carbonation to boot.  It tastes a bit chocolate-ly, and it's rich and smooth without the boozy effects.   This drinks supremely easy, just wish it is available easily in CA so it would become my daily session beer.
NEGATIVE	Had a short-necked bottle which was poured into a pint glass. The color was a deep, cloudy dark brown with a nice creamy head. For a smoked beer, I thought the smell was very light on the smoked flavor. I thoroughly enjoyed the marzen version from Aecht Schlenkerla but thought this weizen version was too light on the smoke flavor in both smell and taste. Tasted slightly chewy. I would probably stick to the marzen version which I thought was exceptional.
POSITIVE	This beer pours a pale strawberry with brown highlights and an even film of pale tan for head.  Smells outrageously hoppy with some nice red grapefruit and light airy pine with a malty base of powdered sugar and caramel.   The flavor starts with a slick fruity caramel but gets drowned out by a hop onslaught of pure dryness. There are bits of rose, peach and a musky, smoky pine.  Feels quite heavy for the style, but slick and clean.  Tasty for sure and a remarkable over-the-top hop bomb.
POSITIVE	What a tremendous wet hopped beer! This should be the standard. A diificult effort while working with fresh wet hops, Founders has again achieved greatness. This beer is more like a fresh resiny tea of hops than anything else I've tasted. This is a notch better than the Great Divide.
POSITIVE	A- poured a dark burgandy brown color. off white one finger head.  S- sweet malt with a sweet caramel blend. woody with a slight cherry or some other fruit hidden deep down inside.  T- the caramel malts and the woodiness of the oak barrels deliver in the front. alil spice from the alcohol and a weird fruit hidden delivers in the backend.  M- medium to heavy bodied. awesome on the carbonation.  D- for 10.2 abv i was expecting more. the four pack isn't to rough to handle.   Overall- this is definitely worthy to pick up.
NEGATIVE	A: Poured a golden orange color w/ good carbonation and a nice white cap  S: Citrus, light floral and lots of veggies  T: Had a little bit of citrus, sweetness, very light floral notes and a b ig veggie note  M: Sweet, dry, medium body but the veggie feel was annoying and overdone  O: Average
POSITIVE	Poured from a 12oz. bottle into a US tumbler pint glass.  A: The beer is a deep amber color with a thin off-white head that fades quickly and leaves a thin lace on the glass.  S: The aroma is caramelized malts, grain, some spice and some hops.   T: The taste starts is very bready up front with flavors of grain and hearty malts. Then there's a mild sweetness that comes in from flavors of caramel, spices and some fruit. The hops presence is mild but complementary. The after-taste is slightly bready.  M: Crisp and smooth, medium body, medium carbonation, finish is clean.   D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, this is a nice sessionable O-fest to pound down for a long time.
POSITIVE	Hmmm... Wasn't overly impressed with this one...  It looks the part here but the hops are very floral and not so much citrusy or piney... They almost seem a little faded?  Fairly citrusy but still a little more floral tastewise... They're sweet but dry.. Not bad at all, but not, in my opinion, a top notch DIPA...   Glad I tried it, but I'll take several others over this one anyday...  EDIT: ok, I revisited this one and it is loads better this time around. The hops really pop here. They are loaded with both citrusy and piney flavors and make this a really terrific little brew. I like the heck out of it and I'm going to get more.
NEGATIVE	Pours out a cloudy amber and sits a hazy caramel brown in the glass with a smallish light tan, off-white head. Fades to a light skim leaving some good lacings on the glass.  Smells rich and fruity, blackberry comes out nicely. Caramel all around in a mild, toasty core. Currant jelly sticks to the back of the throat; mouthwatering is a nice way of putting it.  Tastes lightly sweet up front, malt come out a bit more, offering good caramel flavors, with some toastiness as well. On comes the fake-ish fruit flavorings...calls on blackberry but turns up nil. Some wet-cardboard flaovors permeate.  Crisp in the mouth with vibrant carbonation. About a medium body, not a penny more.  I guess I should learn to not expect much from these so-called "fruit beers," or maybe I'm just spoiled rotten. I really liked the nose on this, but it didn't pay off in flavor, where it counts. Even as a scottish ale, it's fair. Now I've got to get the taste of artificial flavorings out of my mouth...
NEGATIVE	I am going to retry this beer and give it another shot, but I would like to say that I had the hardest time finishing this beer.   Beer served in a hefeweizen glass from a bottle. Beer is dark / black brown. Head is large and steady. Can't tell the carbonation. It looks good, lets keep going.  Smell is overwhelming. Hickory and smoke. VERY STRONG SMELL. I don't have to lift the glass to my face to smell it. Knocks me over. What is this going to taste like? Burnt wood?  I coughed. Seriously, I felt like I was suffocating. Beer is medium bodied. No sweetness I can detect up front, just the smoke in the back.  I feel like I'm exhaling smoke after I swallow. Maybe this is the point. The most dominant flavor is smoke, the second most is smoke, followed closely by the strong aftertaste of smoke. I had to drink another beer to get the smoke flavor out of my mouth.  I'll try the other and maybe this one again since I'm clearly in the minority on this one. SMOKE!
POSITIVE	Bought this 22 ounce bomber in Manhattan, KS today. Was hoping to try the oak-aged version, but the price tag got the best of me. But hell, 7 bucks for this bomber was well worth it.  Appearance: As dark as a struck match. Only the most aggressive pour will reward you with a 1/2 finger head. The color of the head resembles the foam you get after quickly stirring up a glass of ovaltine.  Smell: You can go so many ways with this one. Besides the dark baker's chocolate, I'm getting brown banana, cherry, molasses, and a little bit of alcohol. Very nice interaction between the malt and hops.  Taste: I notice the malt sweetness as soon as it hits the front of my tounge. It stays sweet all the way through, picking up bitterness gradually. It's probably the hops, but I'd like to think I'm getting some bitterness from the dark cocoa that I'm smelling and tasting. I notice some cherry/dark fruit flavors when I breathe in slightly with the beer still on the back of my tounge. Also possibly a note of anise all the way through. The alcohol doesn't jump out until it's down your throat, as it begins to warm you up. Leaves you with a nice dark chocolate aftertaste.  Mouthfeel: This beer is very smooth from start to finish. As expected, not much carbonation. Bordering on syrupy and aqueous, I wouldnt quite call this chewy; it's at a perfect mid-point.  Drinkability: This 22 ounce bottle is the perfect amount for me...I think. I could probably drink a couple if I had the time, and money, but I would rather not judge imperial stouts on drinkability. In my opinion, if you can drink a bottle (whatever size) of this style of beer without getting alcohol poisoning, it's drinkable.
POSITIVE	Pours a lovely coppery amber with a dense, dense foamy off-white head. Carbonation is slow but steady. Aroma is well-balanced, with a distinct flowery and fruity blend of hops and some yeasty bread and sweet grains.  In the mouth, true to style, though with a noticeable metallic tang. Hop bitterness is moderate, and carbonation lends a very soft mouthfeel to a medium-light body. A little apple-skin crispness, with woodier notes and a smooth bready/caramel undertone, but nothing stands out all that much.  It's a nice one, and it's a sexy-looking pale ale, but there's not much to distinguish it. Don't get me wrong; with the low ABV, I'd happily quaff gallons of the stuff, but it's just not much to write home about.
POSITIVE	Reviewed from notes.  Pours a moderate golden color with a white head, though not as large or with as much retention as I would expect. Nose is light honey, fruit, spice, and some yeast. The taste is lightly fruity but lets the yeast shine. Good feel with nice carbonation.
NEGATIVE	A gentle swirl adds clouding yeast to an otherwise brilliant golden straw body in the tall weizen glass. Medium-sized, cottony-white head. Wheat banana bread with smoky wisps of bubble gum and clove. Tangy wheat crispness. Slight smoked meat notes(?). Estery fruits and bubble gum preside before a dry, bitterish finish. Lively, weizeny mouthfeel with a moderate body. Not bad. Im not sure about the smoked meat notes though.
POSITIVE	12oz can poured into a pint glass.  A - Clear copper/orange with eggshell head that left a little lacing.  S - Slightly nutty, floral hops, a little malt sweetness.  T - A nutty/slightly sweet richness that fades into citrus/floral bitterness.  M - Medium/Light, silky.  D - High, the silky mouthfeel is not only adds to the taste, but also makes this go down real easy.  Very nice, everyday drinking beer. Could give Mirror Pond a run for my "fridge beer"
POSITIVE	Oh wow. The world's oldest Monastery-Brewery? I am jazzed.  The Asam Bock pours out with an ashy-colored head. The brown coloring is dark, but not without hints of amber in the light. Very strong-looking beer.  The aromas are nutty in nature, with walnut and filbert, alternatingly sweet and deep. There is also some chocolate in there as well.  The flavor starts with a surprising alcohol bite. This subsides into a dark flavor of caramel and coffee, with a whole ton of malt. The aftertaste just oozes malt. Great.  The feel is fizzy, but with a strong body. The beer has a creamy texture and feels good on the tongue.  This a filling and tasty beer, but perhaps too filling. The initial drinkability is great, but as you continue on it becomes harder and harder. Good beer all around.
POSITIVE	This comes in a 12 oz. glass at Capital City Alehouse in Richmond, VA.  A solid black body as I would expect nothing else in an imperial stout with a thin tan head that doesn't stand up very long (could be the high abv).  The aroma is coffe, chocolate, and bourbon.  The flavors are dark roast coffee, bittersweet chocolate, malty sweet and roasted bitter. This was served too cold and the mouthfeel might get better with warmth. There's a slight sourness to this as well. Perhaps it picked up some lacto or somethin funky from the barrel. Either way, I like it.   Down to the last 1/3 of the 12 oz. and the sweetness and mouthfeel have picked up along with the bourbon oakiness, vanilla, and the sour thing I tasted earlier is all but gone.  This is nothing to seek out, but good nonetheless. Plenty of character and rarity are the two things going for this.
POSITIVE	This beer is a deep, slightly murky looking shade of burgandy. A thin white head caps it off quite nicely (especiall given this one's 13%). The lace formed is web like in nature and quite abundant. Again, impressive given the a/v. Pure hop bliss on the nose. Hop resin. Mary Jane like pungency. Tropical Fruit Medley. Pine sap. And some sweet caramel maltiness in the background. The taste follows suit in a big way. Tropical fruit blends with sweet caramel and toffee. And hop cone and grapefruit rind and pine resin... Great hop flavor. The bitterness is real and it is raw...in a good way. This beer has an edge to it but is really quite drinkable as well. I am very impressed with this one.   Thanks for the Devil Dancer cokes. Next time, how 'bout a Lap Dancer??
POSITIVE	This is a good-looking beer, deep clear amber in color with golden edges and an extremely thick off-white head that forms about two fingers high and dissipates to about half a finger the rest of the way. Lacing is light and thin, but the head is a thing of beauty. This is a bit malt heavy for its name, though it does make for a fair balance. Bready malts with a toasted note, toffee and caramel sweetness, grains, and a gentle spicy rye note that could be stronger, again especially considering the name, balance with an herbal, floral and earthy hops note that has no real hint of citrus and is even just underneath the malt rather than above it. The flavor is sourdough bread (pretty tasty, actually) with a very earthy and floral hops, even a bit woody. Malts and hops may be over-balanced, as I feel the hops should be bigger in this one. Also, the rye spice and grain flavors are here but could be more straightforward. The body is medium, there's a reasonably crisp bite at the beginning of each sip, and there's a nice smoothness that makes for easy drinking. Carbonation is light but ample and the finish is dry and lingering. There's not much detracting from the drinkability other than what I want there to be more of in here.
POSITIVE	A-Pours very dark brown, nearly black. There was no head to speak of.  S-Coffee, chocolate, heavily roasted malt, and some smoke.  T-Very smoky, chocolate, coffee, roasted malt, with some pepper notes left on the back of the throat. It tasted like a camp fire to be honest. I wasn't that fond of the flavor, but it was complex.  M-About right for the style as it was pretty complex.  D-I couldn't drink more than a pint of this because it was just too smoky for me personally.  Overall, very interesting beer, but just not for me.
NEGATIVE	Tulip glass.  Pours a very dark amber/maroon with about a finger of very light orangish head. Retention is OK, with decent lacing. Smell is rich caramel and malts; a little dark fruit (raisin) as it warms. The aroma is kind of muted, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. Taste is more caramel, brown sugar, and malt, but the finish is mostly a not-so-pleasant hop bitterness. Carbonation is on the light end (not bad for the style, I guess), maybe a little lighter than I'd prefer. Medium bodied and a little hot on the finish. Overall, this is not bad, but I was expecting more after enjoying Backwoods Bastard.
POSITIVE	A-Dark blackish brown with a medium sized, creamy, light tan head. Head reduces to a thin cap and leaves spotty lace.  S-Roasted malt with pleasant accenting notes of toasted coconut. toffee and turbinado. All of this is present but somewhat light.  T-Nice blast of toasted coconut, roasted malt and hints of milk chocolate and toffee. If it weren't for the raosted malt/earthy hop bitterness this would be very much like a liquified candi bar.  M-Medium bodied, semi-rich and smooth. Quite a bit of earthy bitterness lingers on the palate.  D-Solid stuff well combined with plenty of flavour. This is a tasty treat of a brew.
NEGATIVE	I don't really know the difference between the two Weltenburger helles beers, except one has a higher ABV. The website has an English version, but it doesn't say much about the difference between to two helles beers. (http://www.en.weltenburger.de/urtyp_hell.htm) The Urtyp Hell is the lower ABV. It is a hazy golden yellow with a decent, foamy head. The flavor is what you want from this style of beer: clean, bright, smooth, with bit more malt character than hops. It goes down nicely. There is a slight gritty graininess in the motuhfeel, but nothing rough or bad. An all around sturdy, lighter bodied beer that hits the mark and does the job. I'd buy more, but I'm not in a big hurry to, since overall it impresses me as being a bit "normal" and nothing too special.
POSITIVE	A - pours a very dark, rich brown with a solid one-finger head  S - smells very sweet - a lot sweeter than I expected. There are hints of vanilla and oak, with sweet tones of leather and black licorice. There is also some caramel malt and a dash of dark cherries. There is also a very faint touch of peatiness, as an ode to its scotch ale style.   T - The taste follows the nose. There is a lot of stuff going on in this one - it has taken me a while to decipher this beer. Very sweet, toasted and caramel malts are upfront and play the leading role. The cherries that are pretty subtle on the nose stand out quite a big as well. There is bourbon and sweet oakiness on the finish as you exhale, and it lingers on the palate for a while. This is an ultimate sipper...  M - pretty thin and watery mouthfeel - very average.  D - Wow, this is a pretty hearty brew. You definitely need to sip this one and take all of its aromas and flavors in. I really enjoy the bourbon that lingers between drinks. Another fantastic brew from Founders - I have come to expect nothing but the best from these guys.
POSITIVE	The aroma is very much to style with both citrus and pine hops. It's also very malty with a hint of yeast. The appearance is orange gold with a large foamy head. The flavor is like the aroma with a bitter, clean finish. The palate is smooth but not thick. Overall this is a very good IPA.
NEGATIVE	Amstel Light, the "Beer Drinker's Light Beer," so they say. I have found nothing within this beer that could substantiate that corporate claim, as I would place this beer in the same category as any other boring light beer that you would find on the shelf.  Amstel Light pours a light yellow straw color with a decent foamy white head that lasts for around a minute. The smell is typical of light beer: light grains, some corn, and definately husks. Somewhat of a soapy/musty smell that I have found in many light beers. The mouthfeel is not surprisingly thin and watery. The initial taste is of very light malt and light grains, and altogether the flavor reminded me of toasted grass (?!?!). Toss in the soapy taste too. Add water, and plenty of it. There is a hop bitterness present and is somewhat noticeable in the finish. This beer has just about no aftertaste, and no alcoholic warmth either. A no frills import.  Amstel Light might have a little more taste than some domestic lights, but it fails to offer anything that would put it above that class as it is still quite watery. The flavor seemed very grassy to me for some reason. I guess this is a somewhat safe beer to drink for those new to beer, but altogether this is a very forgettable beer.
POSITIVE	Purchased a bottle at Julio's Liquors in located in Westborough, MA.  A: Deep copper hue . Topped with an off white head. Good clarity.  S: A nice subtle fruity hop aroma - apples and citrus. Caramel malt balances.   T: Caramel malt base with moderate hop bitterness. Caramel sweetness creates roundness. Some biscuit character. Earthy hoppiness with some floral character. A nice bitterness throughout.   MF: Medium body. Lightly carboanted. Dry.   D, notes: Well balanced. Great sessionability.
POSITIVE	Dark golden, slightly hazy, with an off white head that had okay retention and lacing. Aromas of hops with some caramel in the background.  A good solid brew, much better than their normal IPA, which we had a side by side comparison of. Decent caramel backbone is finished with a striking bitterness.  Medium bodied, finishing slightly dry. The best of the crew of brews at Summit.
POSITIVE	Pours a black coal with a with a thin reddish brown head and lots of lacing.  Scent is sweet dark malts, dark fruits, coffee and a hint of chocoloate.  Taste is outstanding for the style and pretty much follows the nose. The dark roasted sweet malts at the forefront with the dark fruits showing a bit and an almost anise, spice, surprisingly dry finish.  Mouthfeel is fullbodoied and sticky. The carbination seems appropriate.   Drinkability is above averege for this particular style. The abv is large but this one is worth at least one or two more visits in one sitting.
POSITIVE	12oz bottled on Nov 16, 2009. Served in a Duvel tulip at cool room temperature. Pours copper brown with a two finger beige head that reduces to a foamy ring and light cap, leaves some nice lacing.   Aroma is wow, big time vanilla and oak, bourbon/whiskey, alcohol, a bit of caramel and chocolate, wood is the centerpiece of the aroma, smells of a woodworking shop.   Flavor is rich caramel, chocolate, cherries, vanilla, oak, bourbon, mild alcohol but pretty smooth considering the bottle's young age. Some sweetness overall.   Mouthfeel is quite rich and smooth, yet occasionally a bit watery, low carbonation.   Damn, this is a treat. I'm already a huge fan of Dirty Bastard and the bourbon barrel aging is blended so well in this one, particularly balanced in the flavor. More, please!
POSITIVE	12 oz bottle for ~$5. Enjoyed from a Founders pint glass.   Pours like molasses and a hard pour produces very little head. Thick and oily.   Smell is dominated by sweet coffee. Bourbon is present but not overpowering.   Taste starts with coffee, with bourbon as the second fiddle again. Becomes more prevalent as it warms. A nice change from some BA's that are like taking a shot of Maker's every sip. However, the bourbon adds a sourness that I wasn't expecting. So, a little taken off for that. Mouthful was thick and rich, no carbonation here.   Very good beer, but not top 10 in the world.
NEGATIVE	Container Volume: 355ml  Container type: bottle  Fresh: y  Purchased @: anywhere  Cost: expensive  Head: none  Lace: none  Color: pale yellow  Aroma: tinny  Mouthfeel: light  Palate: curls the tongue  Taste: They managed to get a light beer to taste more like watered down pale American lagers than watered down pale European pilsners.  Conditions: Mowing/Working on car- n With Friends- n Sipping- n Get my buzz on- n
POSITIVE	This was my wife's favorite of The Pike, but I thought it was a bit light for being a Scotch ale. The dark golden color with a white head was nice in the glass, but the mouthfeel didn't match up, watery and light for style. Sharp bite in the taste over a solid malt, almost but not quite astringent with a very light hint of smokiness. Musty in the nose with a light malt, and little hop anywhere. Too be expected, a little off center from style, but a very good beer. And, this was one of only two pints my wife ordered in three bars, so a pretty recom there.
POSITIVE	poured cold from the bottle a semi-opaque dark ruby tinted brown to a sun king shaped pint with a 1/2 finger, short lasting tan head leaving a nice bit of spotty lace.  hearty aroma of buttery caramel and toffee. big sugary malts.  super sweet, deep brown sugars, a bit hot. caramel.   big bodied, low carbonation, sweet and creamy.  drinkable - yep. very.
POSITIVE	Reviewed from notes on 8-1-10.   A: Pours an eye catching ruby-amber into my snifter. A light to medium pour yields no head, but a nice spider web of foam stays on top of the body. Some of the carbonation bubbles make their way slowly to the top, while other speed with reckless abandon. A good lacing is present in the form of small dots and long, wavy lines.   S: This is a supremely fresh and intoxicating bouquet. Notes of orange, orange peel, lemon, and lime marry wonderfully with a nice malt presence and the slightly spicy rye grains. This is one of those beers that as soon as I pop the cap, my nose is drawing the smell from the the bottle.  T: Grapefruit-like hop bitterness grips the sides of my palate as soon as the beer hits it. That sweet orange, lemon, and lime flavor shuffles on the top of my tongue and the rye breadyness shows itself at the end of the sip, while the bittering hops clean the palate of the citrus sweetness. This is a delicious beer.  M: Medium-bodied for the style with a great puckering bitterness throughout. Just the right amount of creaminess tantalizes my mouth before the hops and rye dry my palate right out.   D: This is one of the best full-time offerings that I've ever had from any brewery. It strikes the perfect balance for a "Rye PA" for me. There is a copious amount of citrus hop flavor, nice barley and rye malt, and yeasty breadyness available to my mouth. Simply put, this is a great beer.
NEGATIVE	This beer was a dark dark brown, with just hints of rub coming through to show me that it was not black. There is a head that covers the beer as well. The nose has a lot of dark chocolate and bits of coffee. The flavor is awesome chocolate start to finish, but a touch thin as well. The feel is in need of some body as well. This is a good beer despite being a few shades to thin for me.
POSITIVE	A: Nice burgundy brownish red color with a decent head on it. S: Slight alcohol notes with nice woody aromas and a slight sour sweetness. T: This beer puts me in the feel of dark fruit (plums raisins etc) while maintaining a roastiness from the malt with some slight hoppiness. M/O: Crisp and drinkable with some very good weight from the alcohol. Very good strong beer.
POSITIVE	Nearly jet black, deep tan head that recedes to the edges of the glass, almost no lace on the glass. Coffee, chocolate, roasted malt and nice bittersweet notes round out the nose. Taste is of coffee, chocolate, nice firm bitterness, mildly hoppy, brownie like taste, rich dark malt, nice chocolaty finish. The taste of this is out of this world. Full body, creamy and almost milkshake like, decent carbonation and overall very nice. Drinks well, great imperial stout, sweet and bitter, very complex and wholly satisfying.
POSITIVE	Translucent copper color with lacy white foam. The head is thick with a soapy, porous texture. Some malt aromas can be detected, but faint and not much else. Alcohol and malt flavors are up-front with a dry malt, medium-bodied aftertaste. Some bitterness in the aftertaste but flavorful. Overall, this was an enjoyable Oktoberfest beer from a very good brewery; definitely worth a try.
NEGATIVE	12 oz bottle with no freshness dating. Pours a dark, almost opaque color with a thick, dense,brown head. The head lasted relatively long leaving scant lacing on the glass.  The nose is very reminiscent of a Russian rye bread; a dark rye made with chocolate and expresso coffee, but with added roastiness. The taste is predominantly of coffee, chocolate,and roasted maltiness. Astringincy is noted early on, but mellows by mid glass. Mild hoppiness balances the roasted malt without a strong presence. The finish is dry.  The body is medium to full. I am a lover of good bread as well as good beer and this brew was a real pleasure. I usually do not like a marked roasted presence in my beer and this came through with a pleasing mild presence. This is a good, drinkable beer. After drinking this, I will look for another example of a rye beer.
POSITIVE	Thanks to jtrockchalk for this bottle.  Poured from a 12oz brown bottle with no freshness date. The lable is different from the one on file here on BA.  Poured into a snifter, revealing a dark black color that turns a brownish ruby at the edges of the glass when held to light. 3 finger off white head...this one will wait around all day long. A solid layer of retention that does not go down. Thin spotty streaks of lace.  Aroma is a leathery charred smokey wood smell. Also smells like mud, wet paper grocery bags, hints of a spice, nutmegg or cinnemon? Malty chocaolate grains, sulfer.  Thin and mildly carbonated up front with a watery mouthfeel. Tastes like wet carboard would smell. Smoke, obviously, but a well balanced smokieness that allows others flavors to still come through. Finish is dry and smoky.  I didnt care for it, but for the style its a terrific representation. The smoke does not overwhelm the other flavors.
POSITIVE	we did a tasteing of this in class today. i am usually used to drinking lagers because i always thaught ales were a little too strong. this was just a tad bit stronger than a lager but it was great. goes great with a steak and blue cheese salad. or chicken tenders with bbq sauce.
NEGATIVE	I wish I had remembered that I had tried Lobster Lover's beer from this brewery, and really didn't like either version that I tried. I thought this bock was worth a try, but I was sadly mistaken. In a pint glass this beer was a gold color with just a rim of white head. Strong aroma of alcohol, not pleasant, with a bit of sweet malt. Mostly boozy taste, a tiny bit of caramel malt. The mouthfeel was very sharp. Can't believe this is a bock. It bears no resemblence to a bock.
NEGATIVE	Appearance: Poured from the 1pt, 9oz bottle into a pint glass. The beer is a clear dark brown with some red visible when held to light. Head is light tan and grew to 2 and a half fingers with OK retention.  Smell: Rich and smoky, like barbequed meat. Smoked sausage immediately comes to mind. This character dominates the aroma along with a faint charred note, and it's hard to get anything else. Maybe smoked salmon as well?  Taste: Sweet and roasted malts turn into smoke quickly. Leather and sausage are evident. Finish is very smoky, and sends a bit of the flavor back up into the nostrils after swallowing. However, this smokiness isn't like breathing in a campfire, but more like standing in a meat smoker and sticking your tongue out. Very distinct, and not for the faint of heart.
POSITIVE	Founders: Porter (No date) (Tasted 01/25/10) 12 oz. bottle, poured into a pint glass.  Appearance: Pours out dark brown, bordering on black, with a fluffy khaki head that leaves a blotchy stripe of lace on the side of the glass. Looks description on the label is very apt. Dark, rich and sexy. Odor: Soft, subtle milk chocolate, freshly roasted espresso beans. Consistency: Full body, very smooth. Gentle carbonation keeps things lively without being overbearing.  Flavor: Full, rich malt palate of espresso with milk in the front, dark chocolate in the rear. There's a solid, non-descript hop bitterness teaming up with the roasted malts to maintain some sembelance of balance, though sweetness definitely prevails. Finish is roasty and quick, leaving dark chocolate/espresso behind.  This is a supremely drinkable porter. Judging on body alone, I'd say this beer is encroaching on stout territory, but the flavor is all porter. I'll seek this out whenever it's around.
POSITIVE	Happy birthday to me...happy birthday to me... Decided to treat myself to one of my bottles of Breakfast Stout aquired from a trade with Battlekow (my sincere apologies for forgeting that, how embarassing).   12 oz bottle. "Founders Breakfast Stout. Double Chocolate Coffee Oatmeal Stout". Damn, this sounds better than a birthday cake.  Pours deep black with a thin tan head. Smells like expresso. Oh man this tastes really good. Rich chocolate up front, coffee with an oatmeal ending. So damn smooth! This would be great for a dessert after a nice meal.   It's been my birthday for all of 6 minutes but I've already guaranteed it will be a good day by drinking this beer.  Edit: The more I look at the bottle the more freaked out I get. That kid with the ceral bowl and spoon is fucking creepy. Still a fantastic brew!!
POSITIVE	appearance: Pours a 1" off-white head that slowly falls back. A nice layer and ring of carbonation remain after the settling, as well as the beginnings of a light lacing are noticeable. The beer is a golden amber in color.  smell: At first, moderately sweet pale malts with a considerable note of sugary peach, and then mango. The moderate hop aroma provides some floral notes.  mouthfeel: The carbonation is medium and smooth, and the body is medium.   taste: Light caramel malts, pale grain, and some moderate hop flavors dominate. After the swallow, the flavor takes a dry turn with some moderate bitterness lingering with a light hop flavor. Decent flavors, but leaves a little character to be desired...actually, it's quite dissappointingly bland.  drinkability: a nice pale, and quite drinkable, but not what I expected from Founders  single bottle purchased at Woodman's and smuggled back from my WI trip...appears to have been bottled in either May or June.
NEGATIVE	Poured this 12 oz. brown bottle into a Sierra Nevada hops glass. Bladder infection cloudiness. Hazy yellow gold. Giant frothy head left minimal lacing.   Smell was tropical fruits and fresh baked wheat bread. Detergent.   Taste was nice and grassy. Fresh grains. Mangos and pineapples.   Mouthfeel was zestier than on tap.
POSITIVE	This brew has a hazy dark red pour, there are hues of burnt orange, ruby and brown in this brew, pour gave a thin covering of tiny bubbles. Looks viscous and syrupy in the glass, interesting, lots of malt flavor, has a big malt sweetness, brown sugar, chocolate, light berries and candy, some mild hops but not a big bite. Alcohol warmth felt at the first sip. Another worthy effort from Founders.
POSITIVE	Nice two fingers of tan microfoam, delicate in appearance, like a flaky croissant, looks full until you poke that first whole in the crust, that said, pretty good retention and more sheets down the glass sides than lacing per se. Pumpkin orange color, pleasing shine with a slight fade to yellow at the rims, mildest of haze to it, few visible bubbles. Odd for an IPA, leads with accents of cocoa and mocha powder before busting out the tangerine, pink grapefruit citrus, pine and guava, pineapple, nectarine, persimmon fruit scents, waft of pepper and dried herbs, light earthiness and peat moss, admirably stays on the middle path, neither too hoppy nor malty. Full-bodied, you always know it's there without undue weight, never tiresome. Sweet tangerine, lime, grapefruit citrus cushions the pine and grassiness. Cocoa, milk chocolate, caramel do not sweeten the pot too much. The carbonation has above average activity which tends to shorten the staying power of the apricot, peach, nectarine, mango, green apple fruit, likewise its potential for more tropical bite. Floral dimension more a palate residue than main presence. Smooth without rough edges, easy to drink and welcome as an IPA not trying to be a DIPA. Which happens less and less.
POSITIVE	Pours a cloudy orange with thick head. Some lacing down the side. Lots of sediment in this beer. Smells of citrusy grapefruit hops. Taste has the citrus hops, with some pine and caramel malt. This is quite hoppy as I can taste the hops for a while after each sip. The body may be slighty thin, but this goes down really easy. A well done IPA.
POSITIVE	A - Pours a ruby copper color, with a small and short-lived eggshell head that leaves lots of lace as it falls away  S - Hop dominant, but not too complex. None of the floral characteristics of some of the better IPA's, but rather just a strong, one-dimensional hop profile.   T - Matches the smell. Nice and hoppy bitter, but again not too complex.   M - Average  D - A solid IPA, but not one I would seek out over many others.
POSITIVE	Vintage bottle (different label than pictured above, stating "Limited Edition") courtesy of czoch75 -- many thanks, Clint! Poured into a wine goblet, this is a very black stout, allowing no light to pass through. A crusty ring of scorched sienna froth rings the glass and stays the entire time. Aromas are both expectedly characteristic of the style (vinous dark fruits, molasses, dark roasted coffee, chocolate) and surprisingly exceptional in the way they blend to form a cohesive, unified olfactory experience. The taste is above and beyond any I could reasonably expect from an imperial stout: intense chocolate flavors deftly weave in and out of a smooth blackberry vinousness and a dark roasted grain foundation, with sweeter malted barley syrup and earthy hop and mineral attributes punctuating throughout. All these flavors have mellowed with age, it's not hard to tell. The result is stupefyingly delicious. Combined with an incredibly silky mouthfeel that never seems the least bit heavy, despite the 10% alcohol content, this is one of the most drinkable imperial stouts I've ever had the privilege to try. In a word, outstanding.  [Note: I put this up against Bell's Expedition Stout in a blind tasting, and it thoroughly slayed the latter, which is by any standard an incredible feat.]
NEGATIVE	Drank on-tap at Atwood's Tavern, Cambridge, MA  Poured a transparent black/brown with a one-finger, mocha-colored, foamy head that stuck. Lots of patchy lacing along the glass.  Aroma was rich and smooth. Fragrant, roasted coffee and bittersweet chocolate came through strong, along with a touch of vanilla.  Taste was malty rich and dry. Deep, roasted malts and bitter espresso were noticeable up front. Some chocolate notes came through mid-palate before the toasted malts appeared. A touch of hops and alcohol were detectable on the swallow. Finish was quite strong and lingering. A bitter, burnt maltiness left my palate feeling dry.  Mouthfeel was smooth, creamy and medium-full bodied.  Overall, this was an above average porter. Nothing too complex but tasty and very true to the style.
NEGATIVE	I bought this bottle two months ago in a German supermarket, nearby the Dutch border.  I am calling this one a dark munich lager beer because this fits the description of this beer the best.  I never saw this beer before so it was something to try. Pouerd it out in my Struise glass. The beer has an amber colour and the head is broken white. This one has the looks. Nice carbonation.  For the rest this is a typical supermarket beer, nothing fancy, just a very drinkable beer.  Nice soft smell of burned malt. It's a bit of a watery beer. Good for warm summerdays.
POSITIVE	Man this is so dark that if someone told me it was a stout and I didn't scrutinize the beer, I would believe them. Head is about half a finger thick. Nose is mostly sweet caramel, toffee, a bit of smoke. Taste is much the same but i get a strange wheatiness that reminds me of a slice of whole wheat bread in the start and overwhelmingly in the finish. I really like it and find it fascinating. Oh yeah, there's also a bit of milk chocolate as well. Mouth is like velvet smeared with vaseline. Smooth smooth and smooth. I really liked this beer. I would love to buy it over and over. It isn't the best of the style I've had but it really does taste good.
POSITIVE	Poured into my DFH snifter, pours a transparent brown color, some off white head, no retention. Looks slick and glassy to the appearance. Smell- toffee, butterscotch, Pretty two-dimensional...Taste- toffee, caramel, butterscotch. there is a bitterness on the end from the hops. Mouthfeel- carbonation is here, and its needed to take away from the sweetness. Drinkability- the booze is pretty detectable here...this is a sipper.   Admittedly, this is not one of my favorite styles, but it is a good rendition of it.
POSITIVE	When I had this brew last year, it wasn't really one of my favorites, but whether it's that Founders tweaked the recipe or my palate has evolved since then, I'm finding that this has been one of my go-to DIPAs over the past month or so.  It pours a hazy, light golden color with a nice two-finger off-white head that leaves some latticework around the edges of the glass. The nose is outstandingnotes of mango and orange dominate, with some floral notes in the mix as well. Those sweet citrus notes are what immediately hits the palate, but as it makes it's way down the throat, those spicy hops make their presence known, albeit not too overpowering.and a touch of the 9% alcohol is there, as well. This is a chewy, bitter DIPA, which is what I've grown to love for the style.  I'd love to have this side-by-side with some of my favoritesHopslam, Dreadnaught, etc.just to see how it compares, but regardless, I'm glad it's been on the shelves as long as it has!!
NEGATIVE	poured a very amber gold color with a thick off whit head that diminishe quickly to just the out rim the aroma is almost rusty or metallic with some floral and honey hints the flavor is dull with the same metallic since of the aroma but the floral notes and honey stand out more here with a little bit of a hoppy finish and aftertast the mouthfeel was a little to carbonated for my likings but overall decent
POSITIVE	This straw-colored brew with a white, foamy head has a refreshing bitterness with no lingering aftertaste. The slight citrusy aroma brings you back to summertimes past. ABV: 4.2%   Yet another new one for me. This was a clean and crisp summer ale that I actually went back to a second time. Nice light golden color with a good clarity, seems really all their beers have this nice clean look to them with great carbonation. Aroma is light with hints of orange and light grains. But each sip so so clean and quick. It was one of the most refreshing beers I had today. Light hops, light grains, a touch of a sweet note in the finish it just went down so quick and clean. Very nicely done. Lots of carbonation and a very light body made for a super sessionable beer.  0verall this is a must for a hot day!
POSITIVE	2010 version into a goblet  A - Poured out an opaque, jet black color with a one finger, bubbly, caramel-colored head of foam. It left thin rings of sticky lace on the glass.  S - It smelled of coffee, chocolate and bourbon. These three aromas were all very balanced, none overpowered the others. There were very mild notes of vanilla and toffee.  T - Some boozy, bourbon flavors with dark roasted coffee flavors. Nice chocolate, caramel and toffee flavors, too.  M - It was crisp, sharp and smooth. A medium bodied beer with some warm alcohol heat.  D - First of all, it's delicious and fairly easy drinking considering its potency.
POSITIVE	Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. A very dark amber. Much darker than most IPAs I have had. Has a nice head that goes away quickly.  A strong smell of hops and a hint of orange on the aroma. Taste is again strong on the hops and a taste of the pithy part of an orange that leaves a long lasting bitter aftertaste. A little too bitter for my liking. If you wait a little bit after taking a sip you do feel like you just ate an orange. Pretty good.
POSITIVE	A really good beer, but not the Double IPA as indicated. Big on balance and rich with flavor. The look brings a vivid, rich copper color with a hearty headed foamstand. Aromas are rich citrus and pine, that counters nicely against the cotton candy, caramel malts. Moderately full and round with the texture with an expected hop-dryness and crispness. Certainly a terrific American IPA, but a bit light for a Double IPA.
NEGATIVE	A: Pour like golden syrup cascading into the glass. very little head some tasty lacing though  S: Smells of toffee candy sweetness. sweet bourbon.  T: Just like i would imagine. sweet maple bourbon. has a banana ester to it. reminds me of banana pancakes for some reason.... with a shot of bourbon. that makes me smile. considering its a beer the shot of whiskey flavor does come off a bit hot and leaves my breath warm after i drink it  M: real full bodied. completely coats my mouth with some slickness. a slight bit of carb  D: Nicely made beer! I can tell it has been created with love and care. lots of big flavors that meld together quite nicely but still each ingredient is showcased. While it is a bit hot that makes me even more excited for when i taste an aged one. It is a bit sweet as well so its taking me a minute to drink the whole bottle... which isnt exactly a bad thing.
POSITIVE	An excelent, clean, refreshing lager that has a wonderful nobel hop spicyness to it.
NEGATIVE	Thanks to bu11zeye for sharing this bottle.  The beer pours a golden color with a white head. The aroma is a mix of pepper, citrus and wheat. There is also a strong alcohol presence in the aroma. It smells a little more alcoholic than the 8.1 percent ABV would lead you to believe that it was. The flavor is toffee and grass with some alcohol. There is a little bit of fruit but it is well hidden behind the other flavor components. Low bitterness. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. A decent tripel, but nothing special.
POSITIVE	12 oz'er&gt;mug  AP: A cloudy and grainy orange tinged amber color, 1" frothy head dissipates to a constant 1/8" covering with some mighty fine and intricate legs.  Nose: Sweet hoppy and sweet malt.  Taste: A sweet malt, complex hop flavors with a leafy and slightly fruity hop with slight wheaty hints.  MF: Crisp but very substantial feeling, good activity but it also has a smooth and thick effect.  DA: Very enjoable. I want another...oh yeah...it's 10%...so watch out!
POSITIVE	Pours a pale golden color with just a thin head but a good deal of carbonation. Strong hoppy smell with a some floral tones, as well. Nice hoppy taste that I expect from an american pale ale, but not overdone and overall nicely balanced. Lingering hoppy bitterness on the palate; an overall solid and highly drinkable pale ale.
POSITIVE	Served from 16.9 oz bottle into a pint glass. Chilled to about 59 degrees, next time I will serve colder. Very clear gold appearance. Nice big white head, lacing the glass as it dissipated. I had a difficult time placing the smell. I wanted to say peppery but not, and something like old wood but not in a bad way. I read a few other reviews and immediately identified it as the beech smoke that others suggested. It's intoxicating. The taste is very clean with a light smoky flavor. I was very surprised by how easy drinking this beer is. The mouthfeel is nice and full with a lingering smokiness. As I drink through the glass I feel like I keep getting more smoke in the smell, likely from the lacing of the head on the glass. It's much more identifiable as smoke now. At 4.3% I think this is a fantastic session beer. I raise my glass to taking a chance on a label I've never heard or read about before. What a home run!
POSITIVE	Dark chestnut brown with a little bit of pure white head. Citrusy hops and a stronger than expected biscuity malt aroma. This is a really refreshing, fairly well balanced beer. Nice sweet malt just slightly overpowered by citrusy hops. I notice just a little pine in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel was a bit thin and loaded with tiny bubbles. All in all a pretty nice beer!
POSITIVE	A - Black with a thick rocky tan colored head and nice lacing.  S - Malt, roast, chocolate, cherries, and a touch of worcestershire. Very complex and inviting.  T - Malty, sweet, chocolate and cherries. Simply delicious.  M - Full bodied and very well suited.  D - Excellent drinking beer - goes down smooth. This is the first time I've ever pondered a vacation to Poland!
POSITIVE	Thanks to mully for this one. He posted a note in the Midwest forum that a Hudson store rec'd a case or two & I promptyly left home for the 25 minute drive that netted me my first Kentucky Breafast Stout. Last ones in Chicone's!  Even a hard pour gets only a bit of head - I think all of the beer's energy is going into its unique weirdness with nothing leftover for show. And as is proper for an Imperial Stout, it's a very dark version of black. The smell's a little disappointing. COFFEE, it screams. As it warms it gets a little more subtle, but there's still nothing else. I think I could slip this into my wife's coffee mug & she'd never notice the difference until it hit her tongue.   Taste is...strange. I think this is the most complex beer I've ever tasted & for that I have to give it props. There's the coffee, the bourbon, & all sorts of other stuff I can't identify. Again, as it warms to its proper temp, the beer gets better.  Mouthfeel is thick & full, stout-like. Drinkability is really good, it's going to take me an hour at least to down this, the only note is there's a touch *too* much coffee to make it perfectly drinkable.   Overall, really good, but there's still two stouts I'd put above it. Not to say I'm not happy to still have several in the beer fridge!
POSITIVE	The aroma is juicy. Really juicy. Grapefruit on top of tropical fruits. Very hoppy.  Pours a nice golden color with a fair head. It likely belies how intense the taste will be.  The citrus hop bitterness stings right away with a pretty good dose of grapefruit and perhaps tropical fruits (mango and peach come to mind). The 86 IBU's show. Then, through the body, some spiciness peeks through with a little malt. It's pushed back at the end by a hoppy finish lasting into the aftertaste.  Some DIPA's are very malty and some are basically hop juice. This is in the middle of that, leaning towards hoppy. I think this stays away from being so ridiculously hoppy that it detracts. That said, it's one of the more bitter ones I've had. Definitely need to be in the mood for a beer like this.
NEGATIVE	Poured from a bottle into a pint glass.  Look  light amber color, a little murky with good carbonation and about two fingers worth of frothy off-white colored foam that dissipates somewhat slowly.  Smell  a little musky smelling, and very earthy in general. Mostly more malty in smell though.   Taste  much like the smell. It smells like it has the faint beginnings of a barleywine, but it doesnt continue with that due to the musky quality. The abv can be noticed, but its not overwhelming. The finish feels a little medicinal.  Mouthfeel  pretty well balanced in general, not leaning one way or the other in terms of watery vs. creamy.  Overall  not a bad brew, really. Not quite what I was expecting, but that led to a pleasant surprise.
POSITIVE	Thanks Dim for another great Penn brew. Bottle poured into a pint glass produced a two finger head that stuck around for a while. the body was a wonderful clear red in color   There is a great hop nose on this brew with a touch of sweetness from the malts. The flavor profile is hop forward with the bitter citrus upfront with a dry finish. It feels about medium in my mouth with good carbonation.  The brew is a easy to drink and much better than last years. Thanks again Dan. Stouts can make this one again in my book
POSITIVE	A: Poured hazy orange with a good foam stand.   S: Deep caramel malt aroma with strong resiny, piny hop aroma and touch of floral and citrus hop notes.  T: Super bitter with strong malt backbone. Alcohol level is well hidden. Balance toward hops  M: Thick, creamy, and chewy. Well carbonated.  O: A very strong IPA with strong hop bitterness and aroma. Rich malt backbone adds nice balance and complexity to this huge IPA. Hop bitterness dominates all other flavors
POSITIVE	From a bomber that I got for Xmas 2007, finally consumed in September of 2008.  A: Totally black, like I expected. A thin head, lilght brown in color. Looks appealing.  S: Very sweet, boozy, dark, malty aroma. I smell dark chocolate, some licorice, and some coffee too.  T: Yum! Definitely chocolate, dark rich fruit, java, and alcohol. It all goes together very nicely.  M: Oatmeal smooth - thick and syrupy. No irritation from the carbonation. Nice.  D: Overall, I'd gladly return to this brew, although it's got serious competition from the likes of Founders Breakfast Stout (regular and Kentucky), Stones Russian Imperial Stout, and Bell's Expedition.
POSITIVE	Bomber bottle and served in a snifter:   A - Nearly opaque with a frothy tan head and okay spotty lace left upon the glassware.  S - The aroma has notes of prune, caramel, chocolate, toast, walnut, herbal hops, and dusty yeast esters.  T - The taste is surprisingly not as sweet as I first thought it may be with some nice bitterness and charred notes to balance out the malt profile. A bit of anise, dark fruit and nutty as well.  M - The mouth feel is medium to full-bodied with an ashy finish. D - All in all this is more than a serviceable porter and nearly Baltic like with it's fruity tones
POSITIVE	A: This beer was a nice and vibrant golden hue, with minimal head.  S: Great smells of citrus hops.  T: Taste even better then it smells. It is very well balanced with the slight maltiness you get, helping to round out all the piney/citrus hops.  M/D: Well put together, good mouthfeel, dangerously drinkable.
NEGATIVE	12 oz. bottle, 200+ IPA apparently,  A: Pours a dark amber with a small white head, great head retention, some sticky lacing.  S: Great smell, on first opening the bottle you get a burst of pine hops, very pungent. Once it sits in the glass for a while, you get a strong malty barleywine.  T: At first I thought I was going to try and compare this to Pliny the Younger, but that is a fallacy, they are completely different beers. Devil Dancer is much more of a barleywine. The malt is very heavy with burnt toast and treacle. Hops come in almost immediately, strong straightforward pine resin, there is really no citrus. Ethanol is present at 13%, adding a light solvent flavour that enriches all the characteristics of the brew.  M: Solventy, very resiny, relatively light in carbonation, but it is big.  D: Lowered because of its intense flavours, definitely a sipping libation. Overall a very good big IPA from Founders, glad I tried it.
POSITIVE	12oz. bottle thanks to unclejedi  Pours a medium chestnut brown with a minimal tan head that disappears. Faint, speckled lacing on the glass.  Bready toasted malt aroma upfront followed by light caramel, nutty, and cocoa tones.  Toasted malt and caramel flavors upfront. Leading into a mild bitterness and hint of herbal hops. Nutty, cocoa, and bready flavors round it out. Finishes rather clean and dry.  Medium body, mild carbonation.  Solid example of the style, enjoyable and easy to drink.
POSITIVE	Pours from the bottle a transparent dark amber with 1.5 finger thick head that dissipates to a thin layer and laces nice on the glass.  Smell is sweet malt and hops combination, basically if you poured a nice hoppy IPA into a malty crisp lager.  Taste is a smooth malty front followed by shot of citrusy hops, and then the two combine to finish out on the back of the tongue. Just an interesting combination of sweet malt and piney, citrusy hops; a unique tasty brew.  Mouthfeel is smooth, lightly carbonated, a little bit of lingering flavor from the hops.   Very drinkable, I'm glad I picked up case so I can sit and enjoy a few more over this weekend.
POSITIVE	A - It poured slightly hazy and had an amber hue. A thin white head formed which left decent lacing  S - A slightly tangy hop aroma is well balanced by a caramel malt backbone  T - Very balanced hop character  M - Thicker on the palate than I expected, but enjoyable and highly carbonated  O - Your textbook AIPA. It doesn't stand out from the crowd, but doesn't disappoint either
POSITIVE	I really am enjoying the beers I picked up in Michigan and especially the ones from Founders. Red's Rye pours with a small slightly off white head with some lacing. Has a orange ruby color to it.  Smells great, lots of pine, citrus, rye bread/crackers and even more hops!  Loads of hop bitterness on the tongue. Pine, citrus, caramel malts and once again more bitterness. This is a nice treat.
NEGATIVE	Drank from my Bombardier conisc pint glass.  A - Pours a red copper colour with an off white creamy head that reduces to a film and laces the glass.   S - Sweet caramel, dark fruit, toffee and some yeast.  T - Grain and some fruity type malts with caramel. Finishes with some bitterness.  M - Low carbonation but medium to full bodied.   D - Decent sessionable ale
POSITIVE	In a nice, brown pint bottle. Interesting Monty Python themed label. Poured absolutely beautifully with a great, solid head that coated the glass on the way down.  Smell was extra malty and semi-sweet.  There wasn't a lot of complexity to the taste, it was hoppy and had an assertive bitterness to it. Felt very crisp and like an Ale should, full.  I honestly didn't expect so much out of this one. It was a pleasant surprise, and well worth the premium.
POSITIVE	This Kentucky brewed, tripel arrived in a 10 oz tulip a clear, goldenrod body with a small offwhite head. Good retention and stunning island chain lace adorned the glass. Aroma was very Belgian, with tropical fruits(banana and mango), white pepper, a note of cloves, white pepper, and a hint of alcohol. Mouthfeel was medium bodied, silky smooth, with an alcohol bite and moderate carbonation. Taste was nicely balanced, with more tropical fruits(mango, banana, and tangerines), woodsy yeast, and a nice earthy hops bitterness. Alcohol is concealed very well in this one. Very good drinkability and an excellent offering from Bluegrass Brewing.
NEGATIVE	Poured into a pint glass from a 12 oz. bottle.  The pour is amber coloured with a small white head. Retention and and lacing are low.  The nose is mostly green apples with some grainy aromas in the background. The taste is more of the same, but the grains aren't in the background anymore. A mild bitterness is present near the finish.  Mouthfeel is thin to medium bodied with a good amount of carbonation. Drinkability is decent; I can see drinking two or three of these in a sitting.  Though it is decent or a little better, it seems more to be reaching for Monty Python fans than to be a great beer. I might revisit it just to tell everyone I found the Holy Grail.
POSITIVE	I had this beer at the brewery in Bamberg on Friday June 17th, 2005.  Appearance: Served in a typical bavarian weizen glass the beeer is dark red with a touch of brownish orange. The head is white and the beer has another weird "sub head" that is below the top of the fluid. There is a head that exists lightly in the fluid part of the beer that shows through the side of the glass. Very interesting looking stuff. I'd never seen a submerged head below the bubbly head before. It almost looks like the cascading creaminess that you seen on a stout, but it isn't moving, it's just hanging out under the head. Yummy.  Smell: Citrusy with smoke, pepper, and some clove spiciness.  Taste: Soft citrus opening, dry wheaty flavor that dries my whole mouth. Notes of clove and pepper just as in the nose. Fruity and bready with a light smoke aftertaste. It tastes like what you would expect. It's a good weissbeer with some smokiness included.  Mouthfeel: Ccreamy, smooth, soft yet still having a nice drying affect on the palate.  Drinkability: This is a good weissbeer that is well balanced and tasty. The smoked aspects adds some nice flavor and complexity. It's much better straight from the tap than in the bottle though.
POSITIVE	From bottle to pint glass.  A: Small white head that fizzes out pretty quickly. There is a slight haze in the light yellowy orange body. Lacing is decent.  S: Average malt presence of bread and grain. The hops are heavy and have noticeable Centennial qualities. Very floral, piney, grassy and delicious. There are light yeast notes, very leafy, kind of soapy.  T: The hop flavor is extremely clean with a heavy bitterness being more of a mid-palate sensation. Lightly sweet. The 6.5% ABV comes across more than expected, and could even be described as slightly boozy.   M: Fairly full mouthfeel given the style. The texture is thick and oily slick. Lively and fizzy, this brew is nicely carbonated and prepares the palate for the long lingering, bitter finish.  D: While not one of Founders best offerings, the Harvest Ale is still a damn good brew and it is certainly very drinkable. The hop forward aroma and flavor, plus hop:malt ratio in this brew could make a strong case for IPA consideration.
POSITIVE	Pours a very nice brown-copper color with great head and lacing. Deep malt scent, slight caramel aromas and a nice hop undertone. Deep and complex taste, with huge malt presence; caramel and maple flavors and a huge Earthy hop flavor. Slightly rough from hops and there is an alcohol heat to it, but not bad considering its ABV.
NEGATIVE	Best by 8/28/06. Enjoyed in a pint glass at just over fridge temperature after dinner on a cool, late Summer evening.  Appearance- Pours a clear gold with orange highlights... nice two-finger head with some webby lacing down the sides of the glass.  Smell- Gargantuan aromas of honey, malts, and a quite pronounced alcohol content. Phenomenally huge nose, it's like staring at a roasted pig on a full stomach. It's not particularly balanced, and seems like a bully on the playground back in fifth grade.  Taste- Rich, sweet maltiness right in the beginning that turns awkwardly to an uber-honey botched orgy... this is a very difficult beer to sit back and enjoy. Heavy-handed and belligerant, it just doesn't have balance.   Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Sharp and tingly in the mouth... then subsiding slightly, the mouthfeel lumbers through its motions. Unfortunately this beer doesn't recover from the harshness of just about all of its attributes, and I am shocked at the outcome. Either this came from a bad batch or this beer is not what it was two years ago... horrifically disappointing.
POSITIVE	(8 mo. AGED) I was lucky enough to have this beer on draught Fall '07 at Founders, wish I took notes then. Found an old 4 pack in bottles the other day and had to buy them. So I am testing an aged harvest (almost an oxymoron?)  Cloudy, bright yellow with a tint of orange, yeast is suspended very nicely. Poured a nice head, smell is of a sweet dry hopped aroma (but still they are wet hops). I assume Cascade or Centennial? The sweet smell of toastmastered malts.  I certainly pick up the grassy 'green' tones of the beer, almost but not too green, even 8 months later... those harvested hops preserved well.  Quite a balanced pale for what i was expecting from Founders, I diggg!  I would like to compare against Sierra Nevada's.  In all, aged excellently
POSITIVE	12oz bottle received in a trade from Kryptic. Thanks for a crack at this one. Mike! Poured into a Cigar City snifter.  This one is inky black. And I mean black. Only the tiniest ruby hues show when held to the light. The thickness is almost menacing.   Smells are all coffee grounds up front. Fresh and nutty. Not overpowering. Chocolate pushes through as it warms. Muy excelente.  Tastes like coffee up front. Bitter and black. As it warms the coffee takes a side seat to the dark chocolate flavors. The coffee kicks in at the finish with a pleasing bitter roastiness.  Breakfast Stout is thick on the palate with low carbonation, and it really helps the experience. The smoothness allows the flavors to coat the palate for an utterly pleasing experience.  Drinkability is extremely high given the ABV. Wish I could pick one of these up before an early workday...without losing my job.  Nice work, Founders.
POSITIVE	Riggwelter's color is brown with a strong red hue. Head is light brown and quite large. Retention is great. The aroma is a little bland, just a light nuttiness. Taste is sweet and nutty, with a touch of roasted coffee. Drinkability is great, I could hang with this one all night and stay entertained, while not getting full.
POSITIVE	Pours a reddish cola color with little head. Has much the same sweet grain with a touch of berries smell that comes with Founders Dirty Bastard, but withless of the smoky bit and free from the twinge of rubbing-alcohol. Very nice.  Hop bitterness is right up front in the mouth, mildly piney. Great toasted grain flavor that finishes on a rye note not quite sharp enough to cover in mustard and ham.  That's beer. Very smooth on the tongue with sparky carbonation. Fills the mouth well, and with its well rounded flavor is a beer I will enjoy for a long time to come.
POSITIVE	One of my all time favorites. Founders breakfast stout is probably the best readily available affordable stout on the market.   Very dark beer. Pours with a bit of head and leaves some sparse lacing. Very attractive beer. The aroma is huge coffee up front with coco. Mocha coffee aroma on this beer. Could be a little bigger, but I'm not complaining. The beer tastes like a coffee chocolate mild caramel beer. The alcohol lightens the flavors a bit, which is not the greatest, but I am really just nitpicking here. This beer tastes great. Mouthfeel is thick and smooth and viscous. Light carbonation.   Overall, this is an amazing affordable delicious beer. Founders does an amazing job making widely available delicious beers. This beer was the reason founders became my favorite brewery.
POSITIVE	Can into Sam Adams Sensory glass.   Pours clear, bright copper, dark enough that it ventures almost into ruby hues in the wider sections of the glass. Head is huge, towering at at least 3 fingers of dense off-white goodness, and taking a good while to settle back down. Tons and tons of delicate lacing covering the walls of the glass as the head recedes.  Nose comes through as direct but very well done - big grapefruity citrus hops sit on top of a light bed of toasty caramel, really well put together and refined.   Taste is very, very good. World class even. Grapefruity hops come through big to start, though this one is all flavor and almost no bitterness - hopbursted? - with a firm layer underneath of toasty caramel malt that is just in absolute perfect balance for an IPA. The hops are clearly the star of the show, but the malt is just dialed in to perfection. Wow. Finish starts with a big juicy-sweet grapefruit burst, and carries a very manageable bitterness that never builds out of control as the finish dries right up.  Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, medium-full bodied, maybe just a tiny bit sticky. Really exceptionally done.   Drinkability is startlingly good, up there with my best IPA experiences. A really top-tier IPA that I'd heard a lot about, but really wasn't expecting to be as good as it is. Tip of the hat to the folks at Caldera, beautifully done beer.
NEGATIVE	Had this in a beer garden in Philly--comments scribbled on a napkin, so not much to say (I don't want to elaborate too much after the fact).  Light brown colore with a good head that left nice lacing on the side of the unfortunate clear plastic cup.   Smelled bitter, but tasted nice. Head was creamy but beer itself was a bit watery, so mouthfeel is a little subpar.   Overall, it's a pretty good beer that I'd drink again.
NEGATIVE	The brewers tried too hard with this beer and came up short. Pours a fairly turbid pinkish red with no head. In fact there is hardly any carbonation at all. The flatness greatly diminshes its drinkablity. Smells very fruity. Tastes almost like raspberry juice; a bit overdone in my opinion. There was a lot of flocculance in my glass, again distracting. The lack of carbonation really kills this beer.
POSITIVE	A: Hazy straw with a white head, thin ring of retention leaves a little lace.  S: Definitely clove-forward, but not overpowering, white pepper, vanilla and subtle hints of tropical fruit.  T: Clove, wheaty biscuits, a little more bitterness than most (I like that), hints of banana bread and candied pineapple.  M: Moderate body is well-attenuated, not overly carbonated, crisp finish.  D: A good drinker.  This one has bottled & traveled well, but it is lacking a bit of a fresh flavour.
NEGATIVE	1pt0.9fl oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Bottled on date of 9.26.09.   The winter marzen pours a brilliant amber color with a very sticky, frothy head that slowly fizzles away. So far, so good. Smells of caramelized malts, some spices and a hoppy finish. Taste is bready doughs and plenty of malts. Tastes a little watery to me. Mouthfeel is thin and crisp and drinkablity is mediocre. I thought I was getting into a winter warmer or a spiced ale, not the octoberfest bottled in a winter label.
POSITIVE	12 ounces. Poured into a trappist chalice. 2007 version.  A- thin 1/8-inch of dark brownish head. Very thin and delicate lacing. The little head there was disappeared almost immediately. Liquid was very dark, but not quite motor oil and completely opaque.  S- Huge coffee and bourbon. Alcohol present in the nose. Dark malts.  T- Wood from the barrel, tobacco, rich coffee and bitter coffee, light whiskey. The coffee flavor up front dissolves into a dark milky bitter, and tobacco. Flavors disappear immediately at the ending due to the high alcohol.  M- Dry and clean finish. Full body and smooth in the mouth. Alcohol is nice and warm.  D- Good solid stout. Nice and interesting flavor. The huge boy and powerful flavor make this a one or two beer for me. Drinking more would be like sitting down and eating an entire chocolate cake; just too much.
NEGATIVE	Thanks goes out to MasterSki (I think) for this 12oz bottle. Into a NB Globe.   A: Pours a deep brown in color, looks about like a Pepsi, head is similarly colored. A very aggressive pour yields a quarter of an inch of head that recedes to an island of bubbles in the middle and a few spots of lacing.   S: Some nice notes of vanilla and caramel, pretty big hop note but it gets lost in the mix of the huge malty notes. Just a hint of booze in here as well. Lots of malty smells, but I can tell there's going to be a decent hop profile in the mouth.   T: Quite a bit going on here, some caramel malts and a decent note of vanilla and a nice bitter finish. However there is just a hint of char in there that I don't enjoy in a barleywine. Huge hop bitterness at the very end that lingers on the tongue for quite some time. Has an aftertaste that I can only describe as melon like, I've tasted this in other high ABV beers, (DFH especially). Fairly boozey.   M: Thick with medium carbonation, hot alcohol. Fairly sticky as well. Booze is a touch hot still, but its a 12% beer, I anticipated some heat.   D: One is more than enough. Great sipper for sharing on this cold snowy night in Utah, and its perfect for just that. Some age will do this wonders, but its not too shabby fresh.
POSITIVE	Pours a dark caramel color with lots of light caramel head, good looking pour. Good lacing all the way down.  Smells of pineapple and citrus, some nice caramel, light malts. Each sip smells like I'm opening a can of Dole crushed pineapple! As it warms, some of the caramel and malt comes forward.  Taste is caramel, nice malts, some citrus and light pineapple. Hops hides in the background and adds some nice depth. As it warms, like with the taste, the citrus/pineapple moves back and malts, hops, etc... come forward, also some sweetness moving up. Medium body, light carbonation.  Nice drinker. I could easily enjoy this just about any time, thinking summer especially though. Hides the alcohol nicely, so dangerously good!
POSITIVE	WOW! AMAZING! This is a truly great stout.  Pours a super dark chocolate black with a light chocolate colored head that sits there all the way thru the drinking experience. Smells of rich mocha. Its aroma gives off a breakfast vibe, coffee, with a hint of chocolate and cream. The taste is even better. Rich and chewy coffee and chocolate flavors. Incredibly smooth, with a lovely coating in the mouth. This could be a breakfast as well as a dessert! Two or three of these would be the perfect way to end an evening.
POSITIVE	Review # 1600 - I picked this up for my birthday tasting a month ago or so at Al's of Hampden. Poured chilled into my goblet.  A deep black look, opaque and has a thin ring of beads for a cap, the head revives when swirled. There is no lace. The smell exemplifies all that I like about Boris plus a huge bourbon nose with lots of dark coffee and mild vanilla from the wood. There are hints of burnt caramel and coffee with a dark cocoa tannic element also. The rich body and creamy malt with concentrated sugar is balanced by the alcohol from the barrel and mild astringent grain accent. The mild carbonation is good with a slick sweet finish and full feeling, rich awesome texture.   This has a smoothness very few rival and the bourbon is full on/not shy at all, the cocoa from the roasted malt and mild coffee bitterness of the dark grain is very pleasing to my senses. There is a light vanilla quality with the sweetness of the bourbon and caramel that comes in and spreads across the palate. Each sip seems better than the last with mild hops adding dimension and the bitter coffee tinge seeming to blend effortlessly with the bourbon and cocoa flavors -a great taste indeed. I love this thanks to phnphilly for bringing me another bottle to enjoy this is a great Imperial Oatmeal stout and the barrel aging has improved it more than I thought possible.
POSITIVE	Has a nice clear crisp golden color that you would expect from a pilsener. Had a slight bit of a hop smell with something else I couldn't place. Didnt have to much of a head, the bubbles were real light. Had a good flavor with heavy hops that was easy to drink and pretty crisp. A good beer for outside drinking. Nice and refreashing.  TT3
POSITIVE	Poured out pretty cloudy but it looked very good to me. Had a slight apple cider appearance. Nose was that of breads, slight grain and maybe a litle bit of clove. Taste had a light malt ting to it, slighty spicy and a hint of hops bitterness at the end. Mouthfeel overall was pretty good. The flavors came out pretty pronounced as I let it warm a bit. Would definately recommend this one.
NEGATIVE	Naughty Nellie is actually pretty good. The only reason I wouldn't come back to this beer is it's not local and there are better ones to be had in these parts.  It poured dark gold with some copper highlights and a bubbly one-finger head that left foamy sheets of lace on my glass. Floral hops, clover and biscuity malt left a pleasing impression, but overall the aroma was a little muted.  The taste was a nice balance between bitter and sweet, broken up with a blast of hops in the middle before finishing crisp and clean. The carbonation was lively, but not abrasive, and medium body seemed right for the style.
NEGATIVE	Bottle @ home (of course not the whole bottle :-) ). The bottle looks great, the beer in the glass light brown, no head. Complex fiery-alcoholic aroma. Starts the same: incredibly strong, very alcoholic, like fire on the tongue. Goes down burning, like an earthquake, shows interesting fruity notes, like apricot. Very warming but also well balanced finish. Very prickly aftertaste. Really an incredible beer, a hot beer. Well done record!
NEGATIVE	poured a copper color that was ok. excellent head that stayed throughout. good carbonation and good lacing through the drink. the smell is a very intense hop aroma. the taste is an overwhelimg hop experience. i love hops but this is too much even for me. it will take a couple of hours for me palate to recover.   maybe too much of a good thing.  suckem up and movem out.  giblet
NEGATIVE	Poured a reddish amber and you could smell the strong cherry-ness easily. It had a decent-bodied mouthfeel but at the end of the day, the cherry flavor was just too much. It tasted as if it was half grenadine and was just entirely too sweet for me. As for the poster than referred to it as a "chick drink", my girlfriend said it was way too sweet for her too. I supposed it would be an interesting one to try a shot-sized sample of during a fruity beer tasting festival or something of the like, but the entire bottle was just too much for me. Possibly the first founders I didn't love. I guess it was bound to happen sometime!
POSITIVE	Color: pours a very light pink and sits a hazy dirty pink, almost apple cider color  Smell: quite simply, raspberries. maybe a little malt and alcohol helps thin it out but nothing else really comes through  Taste: quite simply, raspberries. i think the alcohol helps to lighten it a bit, not that this is supposed to have a whole lot of body to it anyway. tiny bit of yeast in the finish (if you poured it out)  Mouthfeel: low-med body. little bit of sparkle to it  Notes: not too thick/rich. very easy drinking. would especially be great on a warm day. i can see some people call this a girly beer. the cerise has some big shoes to fill, but i think it will do alright
POSITIVE	12 oz bottle.  High carbonation leads to overly huge, foamy head that does have good retention and a light tan color. Beer is clear with an orange/amber/red color.  Aroma is malty, spicy and has clear rye notes.   Taste is smooth and malty sweet and the start with nice character. Fairly light, but has some depth and balance. A bit of fruitiness in the middle. Blends into a spicy finish of hops and rye with a sour aftertaste.  Medium bodied. Clean, dry finish. Very drinkable, though a bit on the bitter finish side.
POSITIVE	Nice larger corked and caged bottle poured into my Delirium Tremens glass.  Very nice pour with a dark brown to black liquid that has a huge head (3-4 fingers plus) on each fill of the glass.  Not a huge smell, very fine chocolate and a touch of cream with coffee.  Taste is truly exceptional. This is where the beer does not come short in anyway. While this looks outstandind, it tastes ridiculous, imperial coffee/cream and chocolate flavors with a very nice blend of the whiskey barrel coming through very seamlessly. This is the type of beer a lot of brewers try to do and come up short with the aging.  On drinkability - I had no problem finishing this beer, and I believe this should hold up for a few years without a problem. I will update if this is not the case, but this is exceptional.  If you have the ability to get this beer, you really should, this is a rare example of where barrel aging with imperial stouts doesn't just go well, it goes perfectly.  Cheers.
POSITIVE	Poured an opaque almost black with a one and a half finger deep tan head. Head receded fairly quickly, and no lacing left behind. Smell was coffee, bittersweet chocolate, just a touch of dark fruits and caramel.  Taste is great. So creamy from the oatmeal, with dark and milk chocolate and coffee being the driving flavors. A bit of caramel, toffee, and dark fruits are there too. Mouthfeel is perfect. Creamy, viscous, smooth. Just a bit of carbonation that makes it feel velvety.
POSITIVE	Thanks for dob for this Michigan treat!  A-2 inch head on clear amber/copper body, streaming carbo bubble from bottle of Sam Adams imperial pilsner glass. Very nice looking! S-Citrus/grapefruit and a nice pine aroma.  T-Pine and cirus hope flavor on a fairly seet malt base. As warm, more floral and caramel come through. M-Nice mouth feel, slightly oily and full in mouth D-I'm a fan. Could drink quite a few. Not quite a top flight IPA but one I would seek out again.
POSITIVE	Nice dark golden color. Head is full of bubbles and looks like a sink full of dish washing soap. Rings of soap trail the glass. Smell of citrus and a little bit spicey. Taste is grapefruit hops up front. The malt kicks in and balances things nicely which is followed by a dry bitter finish. A little bit of a nutty flavor. Mouthfeel is a little on the thin side but probably appropriate for an APA. Overall another winner from Founders. I love their beers and I'm thrilled that they are available in PA now. I'm going to try everyone that i can get my hands on.
POSITIVE	Thanks Dave.  A - Very dark brown, nearing black body. The head is medium tan starting out around a half inch tall and receding slowly to around an eighth of an inch.  S - Smokey coffee and chocolate malts that were roasted long.  T - long roasted malts, hint of smoke and BBQ, wavering toward chocolate. This is a tasty example of a porter. I'm not sure I've ever encountered a better tasting beverage of this style.  M - Medium bodied, mild coarseness throughout a bit of resin left behind all over my lips and mouth following each pull.   ~ This is an exceptional porter. The kind of beer breweries are build upon. If you have yet to sample this beer. Go Get One!
POSITIVE	A.-in a thick glass mug it poured a rich creamy cocoa tinted head about a inch thick. very nice retention with great lacing. the beer itself was a pot black heavy viscosity with not much change in the light.  S.-awsome aroma, has a expresso/heavy malt chocolate with a oaky overtone.. and some wonderfull familliar smell i couldnt put my finger on yet..(drove me nuts..next time lol).. very alive and complex smell..smelled like heaven=)  T.-like the smell the taste is very simular, rich chocolaty expresso/almost barley wineish oaky with a very strong (but not too strong) and well balanced hopy/Alcoholy after taste.   M.-@ 44* It has a very smooth, not alot of bubbles but very delightfull feel in the mouth. and it gose down so creamy and thick  D.- this one should be taken xtra slow if your not used to this type of beer..i personally can drink about 2 at one setting because it is really strong and almost whiskey like in a quiet way. but for this type stout it is very very drinkable  *definate signature taste. very well crafted brew..I personally love it. i would definatly recomend it.
POSITIVE	This porter poured black with a trace of foam (not much foam, but what little there was did leave some lace on the glass). The smell was mild: dark malt, bourbon, and oak. The taste was rich: coffee, oak, bourbon, and caramel, with a bit of spiciness. The mouthfeel was smooth and warming with a nice finish. This porter was very drinkable, and I had a few. A very nice aged version of their porter.
POSITIVE	A: Black/dark chocolate color, becomes somewhat see through around the edges of the beer as I tilt the glass. Minimal head and lacing left around the glass.  S: Dark, chocolate malt, maybe some lightly toasted malt in there as well, sweetness throughout, a bit of alcohol present in the smell when I really dig into the smell, but its not a bad scent and is a nice additional layer to the dark/chocolate smell.  T: This hides the 12%abv very well. Dark chocolate, lightly roasted/toasted malts and a bready/biscuit flavor to it, a little bit of caramel in the middle,dark fruits, hops don't seem very strong at this point but add a bit of bitterness and earthy flavors in the middle and on the finish  M: thick and rather still, a bit syrupy.  O: This is my one and only bottle of this beer, wish I had picked a few up and tried at least one earlier on in its life, but this is very good as it is now. Haven't had much in the way of barleywines but I am liking this one, especially with the chocoloate/dark malt flavor being the strongest of the flavors. It is going down very easy for its strength. If I was somehow lucky enough to find a single sitting in a store somewhere I would pick another up for sure.
NEGATIVE	Light yellow greenish color, lighty opalescent. White foam, abundant, even if not really compact. In the smell, quite light, there is fresh hop, tending to a slightly citric, and camomile. The taste is light, too, with hop and white flowers again, again light and not pervading. A touch of honey. Thin body, maybe even a littlebit too thin. Some more honey in the aftertaste, but again with a quite good hop. Overall, pleasant.
POSITIVE	Look: Blackest beer I've ever seen! Medium light brown head with little retention, but great lacing  Smell: Dark roast coffee, roasted malt, chocolate, bourbon.  Taste: Up Front: Espresso, chocolate, vanilla. Finish: Sweet malt, bourbon, roasted malt - absolutely decadent!!!  Mouthfeel: Full body, low/medium carbonation, and very creamy  Drinkability: I did not want it to end, but it would be hard to drink more than one of these  Overall Impression: Another beer that lives up to the hype! Simply amazing across the board. I was expecting more bourbon and less coffee. Regardless, it's one of the greatest Stouts ever!
POSITIVE	Served in a mug  Thanks to TMoney2591 for not breaking this one too.  This beer pours an absolutely gorgeous abyss with a cocoa brown head. The smell is really very harsh. The nostrils smell mostly rubbing alcohol, which makes it hard to detect the coffee and lemon citrus in the background. The taste is of heavily roasted dark chocolate, a bit of lemon citrus, oats and an everclear backer. The feel, in spite of the fuel grade alcohol is rather nice and smooth. This beer is drinkable and can be enjoyed, but the fumes coming off it are really a turn off.
NEGATIVE	This is an average American Macro Lager, coming out of Spain. It severed its purpose as a Spanish beer to drink during the Spain World Cup Soccer game.   Appearance: Pours a golden color with decent head and lacing.  Smell: Lightly sweet malt grain aroma.  Taste: The sweet corn flavor is not bad and balanced by some mildly spicy bitter Euro- hops that nibble at the palate. Dry finish.  Mouthfeel: Very crisp! It is a light weight beer with decent carbonation.  Drinkability: It is clearly an Adjunct lager but not the worst import I have had. It is not a beer for studying it is definitely one for drinking during a sporting event or party where the beer is a second thought.  Hope this is helpful. Cheers!
POSITIVE	Thanks to clvand0 for sharing this beer with me. It pours a black color with a finger of head that falls to very healthily coat the beer. The nose is divine. The smoke is sweet, with a really nice coffee malt in the back of it. I like it. The flavor is also very good. The smoke and the bitter coffe flavors marry so well together. So good. Reminds me a lot of the AK smoked. The feel is nice and thick. Drinkability is huge. This is easily a session smoked beer. Big A+. Well worth a look.
NEGATIVE	Orange brown almost luminous sparkling clear body with thin tight white head. Aromas of biscuity malt and some caramel backeg with fresh resinous/herbal hops. Flavour is quite well balanced with the full bodied malts making the hops work hard. Long aftertaste with drying bitterness.
POSITIVE	Surprising enough a mexican beer that isn't the same old taste that is a typical mexican beer. The head that pours off this amberish colored beer is excellent. While the smell does have the tones of a mexican beer the taste doesn't fallow suit. The beer has hints of honey while it doesn't overwelm the palate. Overall an excellent beer to try. And if you love a mexican beer then I would suggest this beer to try.
POSITIVE	Pour - beautiful, clean, clear, dark amber in color with some reddish-orange highlights. This pours viscous into the glass, it reminds of the density of wine as it floods the glass and forms a thin white head. The bubbles are a treat to watch as they cascade upwards. Great looking beer.   Aroma - this is a complex beer to describe. I smell bourbon for sure but also some sweet caramel, oranges, alcohol, burnt sugar, rum, lemon and some subtle hints of candied apples.   Taste - Nemesis packs a punch right off the bat. My tongue recoils from the bitter alcohol kick this brings but this is quickly smoothed over by some sweet fruity notes, some caramel or burnt sugar flavors, candied citrus and definitely the bourbon and vanilla you'd expect. Do I taste some hoppy bitterness? Could be. The flavors from the actual wheatwine seem a bit subdued and thus the barrel-aging and the alcohol really take the center stage. There is a ton of complexity to this beer and I definitely recommend drinking this at a warmer temperature. Let those flavors come out. Very unique and very impressive. This is a sipper for sure.   Overall - I don't really know what I was expecting but I certainly got strong and flavorful with plenty of bourbon flavors and alcohol warmth. There is a good amount of depth to 2009's Nemesis but it still has some serious heat. I am going to keep my other bottle in the cellar until next winter and crack it on a very cold night.   Would I buy more of it? - yes, I am really looking forward to what Founders comes up with for their Nemesis 2010 release!
POSITIVE	Thanks Kappys in Medford for hooking me up with this bottle.  Pours jet black with a creamy copper head.   Hints of oak and vanilla with a slight toasty bourbon smell. Stong coffee tones  The taste is amazing, coffee upfront with some sweet bourbon and vanilla. Also some strong chocolate and roastiness.  The mouthfeel is good but I feel it was a little under carbonated. Very thick and creamy with a little warming from the alcohol.  Overall an absolutely incredible beer. So glad I got to try it!
POSITIVE	12oz bottle picked up at the brewpub. drank from my samuel adams perfect pint glass.   A- the pour yields a translucent copper colored body under a small bright white head. the head takes its time falling, and leaves behind small spots of lacing.  S- the hops become apparent as soon as the beer is in my glass. lots of grapefruit and pine wafting from my glass. after that i pick up on a small amount of sweet caramel malts.  T- the taste stats out with some caramel malts which add a level of sweetness to this and tries to balance out the hops, which come next. grapefruit and pine in large amounts. lots of floral notes as well.   M- nicely bitter. the body is on the upper side of light. the carbonation is just where it should be.   O- one of the best pale ales out there. it gives sierra nevada a run for its money. check this out if you havnt yet.
POSITIVE	A: Poured a an extremely dark brown, almost black color, with a nice two finger foamy head that stayed at least a formation of oversized bubbles throughout the session.  S: Roasted malts, coffee, bitter chocolate, and a hint of licorice to round things out.  T: Bittersweet baker's chocolate, but with a little more sweetness than that. Slightly fruity on the aftertaste.... I'm thinking dates and raisons. The finish was somewhat dry, but not too.  M: Nice thick and creamy feel, with a bit of lingering bitterness that I didn't find offensive. The lacing was substantial.  D: I remember going to the brewpub in Seattle about four years ago and had this on tap. I'm glad we get stuff from Pike out here now because it's cheap, it is all solid, and I now get to re-live a bit of nostalgia from my past.
POSITIVE	22 ounce bottle - $3.99 at Total Wine & More in Kennesaw, Georgia.  Appearance: Slips out an amber body with sufficient clarity and capped with a large, airy, off-white head.  Smell: My mind always wants to assign this type of scent as "amber malts", sort of a pale malt scent with delicate nutty, toasty accents. Combined with the faintly citrusy, dried herb hop notes, this provides for a fluttering gust of toast and tea.  Taste: Pale malts with accents of lightly toasted grains and nuts. Restrained sweet. Crisp hop character, predominately the lightly spicy, lightly herbaceous Fuggles, but also a modest backing of citrus, giving an impression of brewed Luzianne tea. Mild bitterness. Gentle, drying finish with a light lingering tea-like taste.  Mouthfeel: Medium-light body. Medium-light carbonation.  Drinkability: It's good. Keenly drinkable with a sensible, discreet amount of alcohol. Heck, I'd even add this to my regular rotation if I can manage to locate it in 6-pack form.
NEGATIVE	a - Amber body with 1 finger off white head.  s - Big hops aroma but already I can smell a sweet malt backbone which is a little toasty.  t - Rich sweet malt up front and then spicy citrus and pine hop flavor in the end. The malt profile is unique but I can't put my finger on it. There is some kind of malt in there that is not in a typical ipa...maybe a small amount of roasted malt or something like that. I liked it but not sure I'd have it again unless I saw it on tap.  m/d - Nice feel considering how sweet it is. Dries up nice in the end. Very drinkable but sharing this bomber with a friend. Wasn't highly drinkable on a 90+ degree day, it was a little too rich for the weather but not their fault.
POSITIVE	I've had this a few times but i'm glad i've had a good amount of stouts in me so i can compare how this one stacks up..  A - Pours a black color which an inch of of head which didn't dissipate too quickly, leaving behind good lacing.  S - Smell the coffee and the chocolate! A complex smell here.. smells sweet as well and maybe you can the alcohol..  T - Ooohhh very complex.. very smooth.. alcohol is very well hidden.. chewy, chocolatey, coffee taste.. i've had a lot of stouts and this is one of my favorites.. i would drink this every day if i could.. a great sipper if i can make it hang around long enough.. sweet with a great amount of hop bite and carbonation.. this is one of my favorites..  M - Thick and chewy with a nice little robust flavor.. i can see having this with breakfast.. for some reason i'm thinking of this with waffles or french toast! anything with syrup!  D - I can have a couple of these but would calm down because the abv will get you.. but an easy to drink stout. even non ba beer drinkers have tried this and told me how they like it.. it's for coffee and/or chocolate lovers!!
NEGATIVE	This dark ruby colored beer pours with an off white head and very notciable carbonation. The smell is that of sweet and citrus hops with an overall sweetness in the aroma. The taste is again sweet and fruity with a smooth and mellow body. It doesn't seem to be as bitter as you'd imagine. With and aftertaste that is lightly bitter but the fruitiness takes over and leaves the hops overshadowed. My only wish it that it was a bit more bitter, but it's still a nice brew.
POSITIVE	Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a stemmed glass.  The color is a hazy orange/amber with some foamy off white head and some nice lacing that leaves a film on the glass.  The smell is very hoppy with some citrus and floral hop flavors jumping out at the nose. A spicy mix of flavors await.  The taste is pretty mellow compared to the wallop expected from this triple IPA. The hop effect seems to come on rather quietly as you sip. Just the right amount of a warming, soothing feel mixed with the great hoppy bitterness makes this beer a nice surprise for it's quiet hop flavor that does bot pronounce itself too loudly.  The feel is quite light is just right for a hoppy monster. Just the right amount of hops and get about the night amount of funk.
POSITIVE	Not sure if it was just a strange bottle, but I had to pour this one pretty aggressively to get anything out of it.  Smell and taste were but pleasant but mild. Neither innovative nor offensive. It did it's job as a beer, but didn't earn any extra credit. Sounds like my life in high school. Just do the work, go through the motions, and nothing more.  It was basically a tamed version of a floral, citrus flavored pale ale. I'm noticing a lot of the pales and IPAs from this region have and dry, bitter grapefruit tastes to them. That may sound bad, and I used to agree, but now I'm a fan. It really grows on you.  Felt a bit thin, as I expected from the pour, but again not bad. Went down easy. I certainly wouldn't mind having some more.
POSITIVE	12oz. bottle.  Hazy amber color. Bottle says "dry hopped & unfiltered" - oh yeah! Lots of floaties. Medium sized, creamy, ivory colored head.  Scents of pine and alcohol up front. Bread dough and caramel peek through, but they are pretty well buried.  Taste is grapefruit, balanced with a honeyed biscuit. Some peaches in there also. Alcohol again makes an appearance. Finish has a little pepper.  Medium + in body. Medium carbonation. Fairly dry and a bit grainy in texture.  A very good IPA. I just got back from San Diego, and this beer measures up nicely. The appearance is a bit rough, but it is as advertised.
POSITIVE	Poured from a 22 oz bottle into an oversized snifter. Pours a hazy ochre, with hints of pomegranate. A thin ring of head clings to the edge of the glass.   Has a boozy smell, with plenty of malt, hints of darker fruits and wood.   Tastes of sweet malt, grapes, currants, and oak. Some alcohol notes, with faint smoke and peat flavors.   Mouthfeel is medium, leaving no real residual bitterness.   Fairly drinkable, if not slightly weak in flavor. Still, I'd gladly have this beer again.
POSITIVE	A cool fall evening sent me running home to crack this open. This one was bottled in March 4th, 2008. I love when breweries date their bottles and it should become a standard in the industry.  This imperial oatmeal pours a menacing dark black with only the faintest hints of ruby highlights at the edges of my glass. A vigorous pour creates a dense mocha colored head.  Smells of roasted malts, dark sugar, and black coffee. Hops and alcohol are evident as well creating a nice balanced aroma.  First sips reveal a smooth feel and lower level of carbonation. Creates a nice thick chewy essence no doubt aided by the oatmeal. Tastes initially sweet of cocoa and darkened sugar. As the mouthfeel seems to thicken the flavor turns to the roasted malts and eventually reaches a coffee bitterness the melds well with the hop bite and warming alcohol. Great balance and progression of flavors. Very well conceived.  Very drinkable as the alcohol content only adds to the beer's feel, nose and flavor. All around wonderful beer and I'll be returning for a six pack to warm me over the cooling weather.
POSITIVE	This is a great, full-bodied Baltic Porter, but a little less drinkable than, say Zywiec and Baltika, although compared to the latetr it has stronger, richer flavour and complexity.   Practically, but not quite, black (it's a very, very deep brick-brown), it has a medium-big, dense, light brown head slowly shrinking to a lasting thin foamy head. It leaves some fairly good lace.   The aroma is smooth, rich chocolate and toast, but not sharp or as strongly pungent as many imperial stouts, prunes, and hints of coffee and raisins.   The taste is spice, prunes, and hints of chocolate, coffee, licorice, and a daint hint of port. It's mostly sweet with no clear bitterness except a spicy bite, is full, rich, smooth, and a bit oily, with a noticeable but pleasant alcoholic warmth from start to finish. The finish is long but suprisingly clean and chocolaty with fruit and warming alcohol.
NEGATIVE	Also tried this on-tap at Rumsey's at the Clarion Hotel / Conference Center in Shepherdstown. Not a bad brew.  It's a deep dark brown color, with a big slowly fading tan head. Decently stout looking. Nose is gently toasted malts and sweet almonds. Taste is mostly just roasted malts. Slight sweet nutty flavors. Mouthfeel is unfortunately quite thin. Worth a try.
NEGATIVE	Pours a clear orange color with a small white head that dissipates quickly and leaves minimal lacing on the glass. Heavy carbonation is visibly rising throughout the pint glass.  Aroma is of citrus and floral hops and a tinge of caramel malt.  Taste is of grapefruit citrus and floral hops, but watered down and subdued. The malt backbone is weak, but detectable. Overall weak and insubstantial IPA.  Mouthfeel is thin and fizzy with a disappointing finish. Drinkable, but not something I'd purchase again.
NEGATIVE	Amber body with a rapidlt dissapating foam collar. Nose is slightly astringent.  Entry is subdued and slightly acidic while the astringency comes forward in the midtaste. The finish is woody and pleasant...but a little too late.  This brew is hoppier than most Scotch Ales and missing some of the toffee malt flavors fans of this style would like to see.
POSITIVE	Had to have the centenial for the 100th review.  Pours cloudy orange/amber with finger thick head that disappeared quickly.  Smells of citrus hops, not much else, but for an IPA there really shouldn't be much else there. Tastes excellent grapefruit hop takes center stage, not obnoixious, some alcohol present but in a pleasant way. Some caramel malt comes through at the end to balance things out. Feels clean and leaves a somewhat classic bitter IPA taste at the end.   This is a very good IPA. Founders has not let me down yet. I know there is a lot of hype from these guys, but it is because of classic beers like this.
POSITIVE	Pours a yellow straw gold. 2-finger fizzy head with little retention. Slightly hazy, but not hazy enough to call it truly unfiltered. Faint thin bubble streams present.  Mildly strong banana clove nose. Faint citrus tints as well, slightly lemony.  Decent mix of banana and lemon flavors. A little on the fizzy side for my tastes.  Mouthfeel is appropriate for a hefe.   Easy to drink in 95 degree heat we're having right now.
NEGATIVE	Pours a nice mocha-colored head. Color is stark black as you would expect from a porter of this statute. Smell is a bit hoppier than I would expect a porter. Still a very dark malt scent on it, which is encouraging.   First sip is very well-rounded, turning out to be one of the bigger porters that I've had. Taste is dark and has many of the coffee/chocolate bitter qualities that make porter such a robust beer style that it is.   Mouthfeel is powerful without being over-powering. Aftertaste settles the beer nicely and confirms the overall smoothness.  Another great from Founders, try it sometime!
POSITIVE	This deep golden brew forms a nice, lacy white head as its poured. The head disapates, but does cling a bit to the glass as the lager is consumed. The aroma is of grains and grass, with some pleasant complexity. The flavor is bold, yet crisp and refreshing. I noticed olive-like notes in addition to yeast, grain, and grass flavors. The dry finish was pleasant, but not quite as crisp as I'd like. For a grocery store beer, this was quite drinkable.
POSITIVE	Brilliant straw color, nice lace of bubbles around the glass.  Malty, bready aroma, slight hints of biscuit.  Bready taste with a noble, herbal bitterness. Slight metallic taste. Good mouthfeel, easy drinking beer. Overall respectable decent drinking beer. Stoudt's does a fine job in holding true to the style.
POSITIVE	Pours mahogany with a small tan head.  The aroma is bready and yeasty, reminiscent of the pretzels I used to bake as a child. Somewhat sweet.  Bready and yeasty on the palate as well. Dark malts and roasty-toasty flavors come through on the back end with a handful of pleasant bitterness. Some smokiness works its way through. I'm kind of worn out on fruit flavors in beer, and thankfully there's none to speak of here. Damn, this stuff is good. The mouthfeel is juicy, creamy, rich, and just about perfect.  Mmm, yum. Founders makes some good beers. I am impressed.
NEGATIVE	Modest starting head but leaves no lace at all. Light brown color and clear.  This smells like a diluted Scotch. This is all malt nose...a touch of earthiness--no sweetness. The hop is non-existent.  Dry caramel flavor with a bittering kick from hops. Thin bodied with an above average level of carbonation. The aftertaste is nicely balanced with an ever-so-slightly sweet malted sugar and a peppery hop bite.
POSITIVE	Quaint plain silver homebrew-ish cap with a cartoonish smiling reindeer. Props for the only info being their phone number 636 474 BEER. Lovin it!  Pours out a superlative dark mahogany brown nearly opaque with next to no light escaping, topped off with a thin khaki tan spotty head cap and benign grey scrod chunkers settling to the bottom.  Clearly some candy cane peppermint and cinnamon erupt to the nose leading to some modest cake malts. Quite clever, actually. The charm of this hometown hero is growing by the whiff. Mad props for their clever niche.   First swigs: Candy cane cleverness follows to the malty pancake flavor palate. Cocoa and Spearmint gum meet in the palate. This is like a dessert brew in a glass. A treasure for anyone lucky enough to cross paths with this stocking stuffer.   When a local brewery goes all out on flavor and quality, then the review is all out on appreciation. What a treasure. Only Goose Islands Winter and Bethlehems Rudolphs Revenge give this gem a run for the money. Easy to discount this brew due to the overbearing peppermint, but not by me. On this snowy Winters day, my snow shovel was ready to dig it.   Last swigs: Easily, this is wintergreen chocolate chip ice cream in a glass. One of many gifts from my BA Secret Santa a.k.a. Kathleen. If Santa himself homebrewed, this is what he would make and he wouldnt have to sneak down the chimney to deliver. Candy canes, peppermint and all. Don't mind the sediment left in the glass.  Beer is good. Happy (left over Winter) beering.
POSITIVE	Bottle. Bottled on 6/17/10, reviewed on 7/21/10. Pours a nice orange color with a fluffy 2 finger slightly tan head. The aroma is rind and pine with some other citrus notes. Smooth and balanced are the words that come to mind as I drink this. Not extreme one way of the other. I very nice hop bite and bitterness followed by a silky maltiness. Lingering bitterness afterward. A classis IPA in my book. Dangerously drinkable with a 7.2% abv!
POSITIVE	On tap at the Pickering Creek Inn.  Appearance: Dark black with half a finger of head that quickly settles.   Smell: Sweetness from the malt, dark candied fruits and hops.  Taste: Very sweet malt, toffee, candied fruit, hoppy bite.  Mouthfeel: Full bodied and pretty smooth.  Drinkability: Definitely think this was served way too cold, but as it warmed up it really started to shine. Looking forward to seeing what a little age in the bottle will do to this one. I prefer this to the 2009 version.
POSITIVE	A - Pours a slightly dark amber with a half inch of head that turns to a slightly sticky lace ring.  S - Slight caramel and toffee hints. Maybe some toasted bread notes. Very faint.  T - Slight bit of toasted malt and caramel like bread. Touches of toffee and a bit of herbal tea flavors.  M - Bit of medium bodied brew.   Overall it was a very decent Oktoberfest and very drinkable. Nice going Stoudts.
POSITIVE	On Friday nights Wildwood serves one of their brews cask-conditioned. The Friday night I went it was Altitude Amber Ale, krausened and dry-hopped. I chatted with the brewer, James Anderson, and he said that unfortunately he had tapped it wrong somehow, so the beer was cloudy with yeast. No matter, it still was delicious.  Served at cellar temperature. Mango, peach, caramel coloured liquid, super dense and cloudy(though not meant to be), with little head. The aroma is exceptional, smelling of fresh flowery hops and a myriad of fruits, raspberry, peach, dates, blueberries, and so many others. Also vanilla smells and overall magnificently balanced hop notes--so fresh and immensely appetising. I was really impressed. The cloudiness did not seem to affect the flavour much, because it was balanced and did not have much yeast bite. Rather it was fruit-filled again, with a crisp, perfect dry finish. Caramel, butterscotch, dried fruits. Many different flavours add a great deal of complexity, and in fact it did not taste much like an amber, more like a pale ale, with Belgian characteristics due to the yeast. Super creamy and smooth, with light carbonation, but somehow the low carbonation suited the beer very well. This, my first beer from Wildwood BrewPub, impressed me greatly. A complex cask ale. I will be back for more.
NEGATIVE	As the liquid topples turbulently into the glass, I am reminded of the back yard of my childhood. The Perfectly clear golden, like the afternoon sun shining down through the English ivy that covered all of the trees. An ample head sprouts up. It disappears in short order, but leaves a beautiful sheet of lacing. And so i would climb up the dead trees, some leaning on others just to stay up, but I was too light for it to matter. The ivy leaves would break and crush under my hands and feet, and a distinctly "green" aroma... is this Nugget? So resiny. There is a balance there, but it's more of just a sugary-sweet rather than a real malt "character." Reminds me a bit of Nugget Nectar... but the high alcohol doesn't come without a price. There are some fusels in there as well. And the flavour is much the same, the sweetness of cane sugar, not bready malt, the resin of pine trees or the ivy I used to make pretend "salads" of when I was but a chap. The alcohol comes out as well, in a disappointing way. Were this toned down to 8%, I could see it being much better. The body is big and syrupy, very warming as a result of the alcohols... lightly dry in the finish. The memories only go so far... Everything seems hazy now, how long ago... how many places I've lived, people I've touched... the world was innocent then. No longer. The finish, the warming, the effects... show this beer to be a lot like life. It may remind me initially of happier times... but the finish is dry.   At least I can awake to new purpose!
NEGATIVE	Got this beer at the Common Market in Charlotte NC. Pours an orange amber body with a thin white head that disappears fairly fast. Smells of cinnamon, pumpkin, clove and alspice. Ver spicey flavor. The cinammon nearly takes over the pumpkin which is fairly assertive. There's some essence of caramel malt but it's moslty a spice smash. It's got a lot of alspice cinammon blend and very spicey on the finish. Fairly crisp finish for the style but smooth during the actual swallow. Fairly drinkable after some aging but very spicey at first.
POSITIVE	A hard pour produces a 1cm light tan head that slowly fades, but remains at about 0.2cm throughout the entire session. The beer itself is a light tarnished copper color, semi-opaque, with visible walls of carbonation. Fantastic lacing with every sip, too.  Scent is predominantly hop-based, I pick up grapefruit and floral qualities. Some of the malt base makes its way through as well, though I don't hit upon any rye here.  Taste is largely controlled by citrusy hop bitterness, much like grapefruit rind (which I like). A bit of malt sweetness in the back, and finish of slightly bitter, citrusy hops. For calling it a rye beer, I really don't detect much in the way of rye characteristics. Perhaps this is a bit clouded over by the hop presence?  The beer is medium-bodied with gentle, rolling carbonation. This is very pleasant. Finish is not dry, or perhaps very slightly dry.  This is a solid American Pale Ale, though I'm not sure how much I'd want to call it a "rye beer." The hops are aggressive, but tempered by the malt presence. Overall good, but I'd like to see more rye presence.
POSITIVE	Bomber sent to me as part of an awesome trade with dschuster03, Thanks man! Bottle says 67% Hoppin to Heaven IPA and 33% BORIS imperial oatmeal stout, looking forward to it.  Pours darker than I expected... very dark, nearly black with ruby hughes at the edges. Big 3-finger tan head, eventually dissipates to a cap, insists on leaving nice lacing ALL the way down.  Nose is full of up-front roasty chocolatiness, underscored by a piney scent. It's an odd combination, but is intriguing, hinting at a refreshing quality.  Initial presence iss all about the roast and chocolate. The piney hop bitterness follows quickly and adds its own interesting contrast. Certainly crisp. The way the taste changes begs you to come back for another sip. I think it maybe the fact that the hop flavors are piney instead of citrusy, that the interaction of flavors eventually gains an astringent or even metallic quality, its in the back, def not enough to throw me.  Lighter than the color would suggest, almost sparkly carbonation. Very smooth and creamy as well, thank you oatmeal. Comes through with the crisp and refreshing as well.  An overview... If this beer had a heavier mouthfeel and less carbonation it would almost remind me of many imperial stouts. Not intense, but strong flavors, complex and satisfying. Didnt let me down
POSITIVE	Thanks to bastu for sending me this one!  Pours an almost opaque super dark brown with a 1/2 inch fizzy khaki head that fades to nothing. Small streaks and dots of lace drip back down into the remaining beer leaving no lacing. Smell is of roasted malt, roasted nuts, and rye aromas. Taste is of roasted malt and roasted nuts, rye, and some slight coffee flavors. A mild roasty aftertaste lingers on the tongue with each sip. This beer has a higher level of carbonation for a porter with a crisp and bubbly mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good porter with some nice roasty and rye aromas and flavors.
NEGATIVE	What an interesting example of contrasts - so many things they could have done wrong but didn't and so many things that they didn't quite get right...  The pour is a marvel - this beer is a deep, deep red with touches of brown that perfectly evokes a black cherry soda with a bit of chocolate. A medium cream head sets off the color nicely but falls flat just a bit soon, leaving no lacing on the sides of the glass.  The nose is entirely cherry and chocolate- nothing beer-like to be found. The aromas are mostly dark (bordering on sour) cherry with just a hint of cocoa powder. No malt, no hops to be found.  The flavor is quite interesting and almost a winner (also almost a loser). A less skilled hand would have gone too sweet with this and ended up with a cherry cordial. Instead we have a pretty clean American Brown ale at the base with just a hint of roasted malts and caramel. Unfortunately the cherry is just a bit strong which drowns out the brown ale notes but on the positive side it's hardly a sweet brew. There are some chocolate notes on the finish but this is primarily a black cherry drink.  The mouthfeel is quite good and if there had been more carbonation it would have been excellent. This is a nice light bodied brew and because the brewer shied away from the "too much sugar" trap it doesn't have any cloying characteristics muddying up the palate. Not much bittering so the finish is somewhat weak.  I have to give the brewer recognition here for trying... Cherry is a very difficult flavor to get right. The flavor we think of as "cherry" in processed foods is entirely artificial and using actual cherries in foods generally doesn't yield cherry-like flavors. (As a matter of fact, by FDA rules the concoction legally referred to as "Natural Cherry Flavoring" actually has -no- cherry in it. It is 'natural' - coming from organic origins - and it does taste like cherries but the name is a pure legal technicality) I understand how difficult it is to get a good cherry flavor and I recognize the valiant attempt by O'Fallon. I appreciate that they avoided going "too sweet" with the fruit flavor but I still have to recognize that this didn't quite hit the mark.
POSITIVE	I really enjoyed this beer. Had it on tap at the Chef's Table in Rocklin, CA. Not really a typical pale ale as I felt it was a little hoppy for an English Pale Ale and too malty for an American Pale Ale. That aside, it had a very good balance between the malt and the hops. Noticeable citrusy hop aroma. Hops also noticed initially in taste followed for a caramel sweetness from the malt. Pretty full bodied. Neither hops or malt lingered creating a very drinkable beer.
POSITIVE	an amber beer that definitely hits the rauchbeer note perfectly with the quality of smokeiness. woody smokey nose that is set in equal parts with a sweet malt fruit. there is a bitter note in the palate and a fruit that seems to separate in the face of the smokiness. this beer seems to be quite temperamental when it come to what you drink it with because it accentuates the malt differently. i would like to see a bit of a different qualities in palate outside of the expected. even though its a doppelbock at 8% abv it still seems to have a similar quality to most all the others. which is a good thing for those that are looking for something that places the alcohol well. but that is the only thing that separates each individual beer. if you're in the mood for a rauchbeer then have this brewery. end of question but i would like to see more accent in the malt tones. it may be because i had beets with it and it give it a particular sweet quality to it. its too sweet... and i'm a bit disappointed.
POSITIVE	Which of these items don't belong to this beer? 10% ABV, Double IPA style, or 99 cents for a 12 ounce bottle? Actually, they all apply to the bottle I got at Vendome, which was in the markdown section for some reason. Never having a DIPA before, I took a flyer on this low-risk/ high reward brew. Let's get on to it:  A thick, compact head rises from the beer. It's hoppy alright, mixed with scents of piney tropical fruits. I was expected a blitz of hops in the taste, but it wasn't as intense as I was expecting. Flavors of orange, mango, sweet malts, and a hoppy finish dominate the taste. Despite a warm feeling from the 10% ABV which burned as it went through my chest, it was easy to drink for such a style. Because of that, keep track of how much you've had of this if you plan to operate machinery afterwards.
POSITIVE	12 oz. bottle.  A: Orange amber body, off white head receding to patchy foam. Nice sip rings. Nice lacing.  S: Grapefruit, Carmel and Rye. Unmistakably Rye.  T: Comes on with a ferocious, bitter, hop presence, then a sweet, caramel middle and a glorious, drying, rye finish.  M: Medium-bodied. Prickly from the grapefruit, and a serious drying effect at the end.  D: At 6.6ABV this is sessiable, but I was satisfied after two. The balance of bitter and sweet make it an instant favorite of mine.  I think Founders sometimes tries too hard with their gigantic, ambitious offerings, but this one is spot on. This is a fantastic beer that is reasonably priced to boot!
NEGATIVE	Pours a cloudy, dark maize color. 1/5 inch head of a white color. Poor retention and poor lacing. Smells of grain, cider-like aroma, slight metallic, hint of honey, and a hint of wheat. Barely fits the style of a English Strong Ale. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of grain, cider-like flavor, hint of honey, and slight sweet malt. Overall, poor appearance, and lacking in aroma and body.
POSITIVE	appearance: deep dark brown, lackig had retention  smell: caramel, toasty malts. banana, spice  taste: danm good dark hefe. some banana  mouthfeel: a little light, good carbonation, not over done  drinkability: I love the dark wheats of germany. this is a great examaple.
POSITIVE	A- Black, no head. Small brown ring around the edges.  S- Dark fruits, hints of bourbon and oatmeal. Smells great.  T- Dark chocolate, hints of oatmeal. Roasted malt. Blended and balanced beautifully. Incredibly smooth.   M- Medium bodied. Slightly sticky. So smooooth.  D- Very smooth, complex and rich.
NEGATIVE	09 from keg  A-Cloudy with some foam that laces and hangs on throughout. Deep orange color.  S-Oak is predominant aroma with this one.  T-Nice flavor but alcohol note is a bit stronger than I'd like.  M-Thick, a substantial drink.  D-Pretty good considering the strength
POSITIVE	Pours a thick black, like used motor oil, with a nice brown head that fades to a very thin ring.  Smells of figs, raisins, coffee, and chocolate. Thick, sweet, smoky, and heavy.  Tastes of dark chocolate, espresso, and a hint of figs and roast. Definitely let this warm up a bit from the fridge. A very smooth and tasty beer.  Mouthfeel is creamy, smooth, and wonderful. Massive but not harsh.  Drinkability is insanely good for a 12% beer. You can't see that there's any alcohol in here. That said, one of these will definitely be enough for me, I have to be conscious tomorrow.
POSITIVE	Thought this was a very good Pilsner compared to others I've had. The saaz hop character was a bit more mild, and a combination of sweeter malt and less harsh carbination made this much more pleasant to drink. The combination of less bitter taste and smooth mouthfeel was excellent, making this easy to drink.
NEGATIVE	I wasn't all that impressed with this pale ale. It pours a basic amber with a decent head, with some retention and lacing. It's smells quite yeasty, and a bit skunking. The taste is strong and too bitter. There is a notable sulfur and skunky quality to it and it leaves a bit of a sour aftertaste. It's mouthfeel is fair, but I don't see really drinking this one.
POSITIVE	Pours a nice black color with a tan head that seems to stick around for a while! The smell is very boozy and has a oat smell as well.   The taste is a little thin, not very hoppy, but decent. It's notes of bourbon are there but wait to the finish to come about.  I think at 8.5% its super drinkable and very dangerious if quickly consumed! Its a brew that I would like to enjoy more often. A very good go to bourbon stout!   Cheers!
POSITIVE	I used to love this stuff... well, love is a strong word but I used to drink a lot of it. I was young and didnt know any better. For a light beer, this is pretty good. One downside, something I never noticed (or managed to pay attention to) when I was drinking this regularly is a soapy thing going on in the finish of the mouthfeel/flavor. Light and watery all around but you can't expect too much for a light beer. It's very easy to suck these down because of watery and generally inoffensive characteristics. This has a bit more character than many other light beers out there. Nothing worth dreaming about here, but a viable option depending upon your options.
NEGATIVE	16.9 oz heavy duty brown bottle. Clear freshness dating which I always like to see on imports.   The beer pours a nice bright gold with a huge initial head. Decent lacing   Nice smell of grains, malts and some floral hops. No off aromas at all.  The taste is slightly sweet and a bit metallic. The beer tastes a little washed out with some graininess coming on  way through. The hops seem to disappear. This is a very, very mild tasting beer. Seems slightly off.  The beer is a bit under carbonated for the style. Still it has a solid feel to it. Drinkabity suffers a bit from the unassertive taste profile. Im pretty under whelmed by this one. Probably the weakest of any Czech beer I have had. .99 at Sals Liquors in Elmhurst.
POSITIVE	500 ml bottle picked up in Buffalo.  Pours a clear dark orange, some reddish hues, almost ruby, thick medium head forms and settles to a thin layer and medium ring around the glass, some lace spots stick, real vibrant color, looks pretty nice.  Smell is neat, very sweet and smokey, a bit of burnt wood, brown sugar, thick and malty, a bit of sweet raisin, very rich, really nice toffee/caramel smokey note, cool aroma on it, I dig it.  Taste is really nice too, intense maltiness, very sweet, big toffee and caramel, a bit of brown sugar, very nice smokiness, mild and subtle, cherrywood and mesquite, raisin, alcohol is well hidden, really nice finish, very light spiciness.  Mouthfeel is great, medium to full bodied with low carbonation. Silky smooth going down, really nice stuff.
POSITIVE	Poured a bottle of this into a glass mug.  A: Pours a red, amber body with a small, off-white head with nice retention and lacing along the side of the glass all the way to the finish.  S: A bittersweet and spicy smell, typical of a nice, rye beer.  T: A strong, dry bitter, rye taste with a strong and slightly sour aftertaste. An earthiness was evident as well in the aftertaste that did well to compliment the taste.  M: A fairly decent mouthfeel that was pretty good and full-bodied.  D: Ok dirnkability overall, Decent combination of mouthfeel and taste. Pretty good beer overall; a nice session beer, but nothing too impressive.
NEGATIVE	Pours a clear yellow brew with a very violent carbonation level.  Smell is sweet malt and grain and a bit of a horse blanket smell. Mild fruity smells too.  Taste is neutral and grainy with a bit of tartness to it. For some reason I can taste alcohol in this.  Mouthfeel is average.  An OK drinkable brew that reminds me too much of Budweiser.
POSITIVE	Above average DIPA. Good aroma, good, no a great bittereness. Grapefruit colour with a little, though bubbly head.IBU 80-90 in taste as it is drinkable, rememering we are doing an assault force of DIPAs, and the malt is at the end, though lists at 160.
POSITIVE	Pours into the glass a clear copper color. Well carbonated as the bubbles are very present. There was very little head and no lace. The aroma was simple. Clean and crisp. The flavor was clean. Slight hops. Very refreshing beer.
POSITIVE	A: Nice signs of carbonation, a decent head, a cloudy pale color.   S: Hops; Pine, citrus.   T/M: Grapefruit and pine characteristics from the hops, a hint of caramel at the end, and a nice grain flavor. Very good, with plenty of hops and a nice bitter taste. Carbonated, a slight burn from alcohol at the end.   O: A very good IPA from Founders. Definitely recommend.
POSITIVE	This is an outstanding brew! Founder's again!! Some chocolatey mocha going on with some possible caramel and toffe, but light, very creamy and light. A definitely different brew. Some nice hops on the back end and a lot of mocha. A refreshing beer that washes down better than a porter and highly recommended.
NEGATIVE	pours typical black stout color with frothy brown head. thick lacing. smells of faint roasted malt. slight chocolate notes. taste is of bitter dark chocolate, with very little sweetness. the alcohol is hot in the flavor as well. mouthfeel is nice and smooth. drinkability, well, I was disappointed in this one. It's highly rated (and maybe mine is too fresh) but the bitterness and bite from the alcohol make this a mediocre offering.
NEGATIVE	It's better to state this from the beginning: I prefer my cured meats on the side and not in the brew. The rauchbier poured with two fingers of beige foam. It has a nice brown color and smells of cured meats and burned wood. The taste is smokey, of cured meats and some metal with a bitter bite of hops in the end. It has a creamy mouthfeel although it feels a bit weird to drink. I think it is an interesting beer but drinking it will never be a habit of mine.
NEGATIVE	Darkish red pour with a moderate head. Nose is wonderfully tart with the vaguest malt underbody.  The flavour on this is essentially Founders Pale with a heaping pile of cherries piled on top of it. Clearly they used a lot of real fruit (like all of their fruit beers) as the flavour is exceptionally tart but not cloyingly sweet, which is the usual hallmark of artificially fruit flavoured beers.  Moderately easy drinking depending on your personal tolerance for fruit beers. I wouldn't have more than one for a change of pace, personally.  Overall: A smooth, tasty example of a fruit beer. If you like cherries, then this is definitely worth trying.
POSITIVE	Copper colored beer with a nice sticky off-white head with some orange hues. Classic Western IPA aroma of loads of citric hops. Also some mildly herbal aromas but this beer is all about the C-hops. Well balanced yet still hoppy. Grapefruit, pinecones and fresh mint in the flavor. Medium to full bodied and wayyy too drinkable. I looked down and my glass was empty. A great IPA in a can, what's not to love. Oh yeah, we can't get it in NC that's what's not to love.
POSITIVE	Poured into a shaker pint. Rich clear copper color and a nice tan head that slowly turns to a film. Good lacing. This is one beer I could sit around all night just to inhale the aroma which is just like walking into a smokehouse filled with bacon. Its really smooth with a barely able to detect bock taste. A wonderful smokey after-taste. Makes me want to run out to my local rib joint for a rack.
NEGATIVE	Drank from a 12 fl. oz. bottle purchased at Liquor World, Cambridge, MA  I saved this special treat for review #200. Poured a super thick and viscous pitch black. I have compared other beers' appearances to motor oil but this one much better suits that description than the rest. There was no head on the beer but rather a small amount of coffee-colored, bubbly frothiness. Tiny streaks of lacing clung to the sides of the glass.  The aroma was outrageously rich and beautifully aromatic. (I felt that only giving this beer a "5" for smell was doing it a disservice.) As soon as the beer was poured, sweet-smelling, freshly roasted coffee beans smacked me in the face. (The only other beer that had such an intense coffee aroma was Founder's Breakfast Stout.) Fragrant notes of molasses, brown sugar, vanilla and a distinct oakiness rounded out the nose.  The taste was rich and flavorful but not as smooth as the aroma. Deep roasted malts and coffee were apparent up front. The coffee flavor continued along the palate, taking on an almost Bailey's-esque flavor at times. Oaky, woody notes and maple syrup emerged mid-palate. The initial pleasant alcohol warming on the back end turned a bit hot by the drink's end. The finish was bourbon-like, hoppy (a somewhat minty and tingly hop flavor) and dry and it became progressively stronger as the beer warmed. By mid-bottle, the hoppiness emerged considerably and was noticeable from start to finish. The never ending aftertaste was reminiscent of freshly brewed coffee.  Mouthfeel was extremely full-bodied (this may have been the thickest beer I have ever drank), viscous, creamy and rich. It truly felt like a blanket on my tongue.  As for drinkability, this beer was a mixed bag. I enjoyed the initial flavors immensely, but found that both the hops and the alcohol became a bit overwhelming as the beer warmed. The effect of the 10% ABV definitely hit me hard.  Overall, this was a terrificly complex, flavorful, rich and unique beer. At $20 for a four-pack this stuff is pricey, but I am glad I had the opportunity to try it.
POSITIVE	1 pint, 6.3 fl. oz. green bottle. Skunky beer, very bitter hops. No listed alcohol percentage.  I'm not one to down-rate a beer on the basis of one bottle, but this beer was not pleasant to drink. Sometime in the future I may try again   Update: Tall can. Pours pale gold 2" white head.  Smell is slight floral.  Taste is smooth and balanced. Just enough hops for the style.  Mouthfeel is alright for the type.  Drinkability is much better than average. Due to the relatively common skunky issue cans are recommended for this beer.
POSITIVE	Haze, pale yellow/green, pearish coloring, fine white head, thin, but lasting.   Aroma is lemony and slight, vinegary with shades of straw. Bits of spice. Not terrible, but not to my liking.  Smooth sailing once in the mouth, slick and smooth, absolutely quenching. Not much depth or body, but there's not supposed to be, I wager. Very light, with an agreeable, if minor, flavor. There's a little bit of grainy malt texture that creeps in, but not too much. Actually, I like more as I drink it...decent.   Being wet and no trouble down the throat is the order of the day and Stoudt's Pils fills the bill.
POSITIVE	I've enjoyed this quite often over the last couple years. Like all Pike beers, it has a very nice label; clean lines, stately.   It pours a deep mahogany with a nice, uneven head. Carbonation tops it in very sporadic patterns, like the yeast was still active. The smell is sweet and malty with a slight smoked tinge. The taste in this batch is a bit sweet, but normally its a wonderful full and chocolate body. If you're not careful, you can drink a whole sixer, and it really affects your skiing.
POSITIVE	Been getting really into trying different Founder's beers after getting my hands on breakfast stout and CBS... Found this in a four pack at my local liquor store they had one 4pk left after I bought this one... I'll be going back for the other one hopefully it's still there. Pours a great color dark in the center but tan in the light around the edges smell of alcohol and bourbon. Tastes just as delicious the whisky is really present here which is a huge plus. Smooth easy to drink just overall delicious. If you've been pining for some of Founder's rarer brews and you come across this do yourself a favor get some. Do it... Do it... C'mon Do it...
NEGATIVE	I bought a 6-pack of this from Woodman's in Janesville, WI in spring 2011.   Pours a yellowish amber color with a decent amount of carbonation to it. Has scents of summer wheat and citrus fruits. Drinks rather lightly but with a decent amount of flavor to it. Wheat and orange hints are the most obvious. Definetly a good summer beer that has a better taste to it that the standard Miller or Budweiser choice. Not anything fancy but something new to try.
NEGATIVE	A beer made by werewolves! How could I pass this up?!  Pours a rich amber color, like the werewolf who made it accidentally spilled some blood into it. I really hope that's not the case. Very cloudy, lots of sediment. Hope that's not fur. Damn werewolves. The pinkish-white head is short lived, no lacing and no cling.  Smells very sweet, bready malts and carmel. Really appealing on the wiffer.  Sugar sweet and biscuit taste. Not a bad belgium flavor. The alcohol seems to come through in the end, not really a pleasant finish but otherwise tastey.  The impact on the palate though... Damn. Hot alcohol taste, virtually no carbonation. Someone should talk to these werewolves, they need to spend less time hunting people down and devouring them and more time paying attention to what they're brewing. If I lived in the area I'd take care of it myself, threaten the bastards with some silver bullets or some shit; that's the kind of thing they respond to.  With the high alcohol content and flat taste, I don't see this being much for a session. I might drink this again if I were strapped for cash (only $2 for the 1.09 pint bottle) but otherwise I'd steer clear of it.
POSITIVE	Poured into a snifter from a 12 oz bottle. Pours a ruddy blackish brown with a light brown head that provides ample lacing.  In the nose is chocolate, moderate espresso.  The flavor follows the nose, a nice roasted malt character hints of smoke and coffee. Chocolate sweetness is just under the radar, and the earthy hop is there providing residual bitterness. Imagine waking up and eating oreos with your coffee and cigar, in liquid form.  Mouthfeel is superb. High carbonation with a smooth drying finish. Crisp on the palate, and is actually not as heavy as I would expect.  Drinkability is very good as well. A very tasty porter here that may be the benchmark for the style. I would reccommend buying a case of this lovely beer.
POSITIVE	Kentuckys finest enters the tumbler a light golden blond. An off white lose bubbly head sits atop. Good clarity with obvious carbonation. Odors of grain and yeast mingle with a blend of maize and herbs. Initial impressions of popcorn flavor and oats. Midmouth has a slight herbal influence, while the finish is a combination of slightly burnt popcorn and Kelloggs Pop cereal. Thin bodied and easily quaffed. The head retention and side lacing are evident throughout the entire glass. Interesting yet understandable name for a thoroughbred brew from Kentucky. Ballsy move.that Horse Piss beer.   Overall a decent Lager and a step above any macro Lager. Love the bucktooth horse on the label!
POSITIVE	12oz bottle in Sam Adams glass  A: Completely black with thin tan head, leaves no lace.  S: Smokey, but not in an overpowering way. T & M: There are definitely smoked malts here. I would like a little more roundness, it seems like all of the sugars got fermented away, feels a little thin.  D: This is a nice beer, the smoke is nicely balanced, not overpowering. A good porter but would like a little more maltiness. Definitely recommended if you like porters/stouts.
POSITIVE	A well built imperial stout. Poured from a 12 oz. bottle to a pint tumbler. It pours a deep dark black and only a thin head. Only subtle carbonization present. Not an overwhelming smell, but the malt and coffee overtones are present. Alcohol is present, but does not overtake the malty & chocolate taste. An excellent, not overdone flavor. With the low carbonization and thin ale texture, it feels light for a stout in your mouth. A surprisingly drinkable imperial stout, I had a couple this evening quite easily.
POSITIVE	Poured into a pint glass,  A: Nice dark amber color, almost a reddish amber, nice lacing on glass with a nice tan head.  S: I can smell hops and malt, not much else  T: Nice hoppy with a hint of fruit and malt, not overpowering but just enough to keep me interested.  M: A nice balanced mouthfeel not too thin or thick, but just the right balance  D: Very drinkable would share with friends on any occasion
POSITIVE	I'm reviewing this one so I can add another state to my profile. And it's a pretty good beer. Yazoo is a hidden gem down in TN.  Opaque black with about a one finger french vanilla head. Slowly settles to a foamy ring along the glass. When I lift the glass, there are ruby highlights at the bottom around the edge.   The aroma is light but still has a good amount of complexity. A touch of molasses is in the background, along with some chocolate. The rye adds a dry graininess.  The rye sets up the base with a little bit of a sour tinge. There are some hops in there as well that compliment it well with a bit of bitterness. The hops are balanced with a little bit of sweet chocolate. The roasted malts come though as well, and come out almost like roasted black coffee. Rather full bodied with just the right amount of carbonation. The chocolate and coffee hang on well after each sip.  A very good porter, and I'm not sure I've ever had one with rye. A good stand up beer, well made, well rounded, and definitely worth a six-pack at least. Recommended.
POSITIVE	A: nice deep coppery red. Good, creamy caramel head, average retention. Good lacing.   S: Malty, sugary sweet, wee toffee aromas. Raisiny & appley notes. This is poised to be rather exciting!  T: Malty, caramelly, sweet toffee, sugar. Some (little) hops. This is a true English ESB at its best. Not an American Pale Ale, for sure - waaay too well balanced. Brought me right back to the pubs of the Northern Lake District & Dales.  MF: Full, creamy smooth. Good English carbonation level.   D: I really, really enjoyed this one. A great pint to have with the chaps at the bar. Sooo English!   Overall: A real enjoyable pleasure! Got this "on clearance" for $2.49, wish I had bought a case, Really a taste of Northern England in a bottle. Excellent!
NEGATIVE	Appearance: Pours a clear, yellow body with a small, white head.  Smell: Pale malts with some floral hints and notes of honey and chicken broth.  Taste: Pale malts with a teensy weensy hint of grain and light, honeyish sweetness. Minimal hop presence, only a bit floral with a weak bitterness. Big sip of spring water. Drying, watery finish.  Mouthfeel: Light-bodied. Medium carbonation. It's watery, I must say.  Drinkability: Contrary to the belief of the back label, I'm not so sure Gediminas, Grand Duchy of Lithuania would "applaud" this beer. I know I did not. I big step down after sampling the Baltika 5 and 7, and that's saying alot!
POSITIVE	Picked up a growler of 08 vintage Founders Imperial Stout from the Charleston Beer Exchange.  A - I poured this into a tulip glass. Pours an almost midnight-black brown with a thin, microscopically bubbled dark khaki head and quickly slips away to the edges of the glass.  S - Mellow coffee; perhaps was bitter at one time but has been mellowed by aging. Dark chocolate and cocoa, and a hint of hoppiness.   T - Up front it is like gourmet dark chocolate with a touch of added sweetness. Really faint hop bite in there. Ends with a really rich, cocoa filled, alcoholic bite to the aftertaste. Really, really nice.  M - Viscous, slightly more than medium bodied, decent carbonation.  Fantastic.
POSITIVE	Another Founders from Captainren.  12oz bottle poured into a Ping Glass.  5.17.2010 bottle date. Wow! almost a year old for a DIPA :(  A- Reddish-orange in color, cloudy. A thin cream/tan colored head. Good retention.  S- Sweet malts.  T- Sweet oranges and tangerine.  D- hop bitterness, but none of the hoppy flavors. Too sweet for me. Age is the issue here I am guessing.
NEGATIVE	Amber in color and a little bit cloudy in appearance. Pretty substantial and foamy head that clings to the glass. Decent amount of prickle in the beer. Light fruit tones in the nose, perhaps a fruity candy type of quality. The attack is mildly sweet with perhaps hints of fruit, I wonder if it might be imparted to my tastebuds by the fragrances I experienced. After further investigation I discover that the fruit/floral sensations cling to the edges of the mouth and are indeed part of the flavor and/or mouthfeel. There is a subtle drying sensation in the mouth and perhaps just a little drop of butterscotch like flavor on the very tip of the tongue as the mouth dries and everything else clears away. Perhaps this is where I got the candy from.
POSITIVE	12 oz bottle poured into pint glass  A: Black/maybe darkest brown, no light gets though at all, light brown head that stands up pretty well on the pour, starts fading to some foam in a few minutes  S: Bright stout notes, doesn't smell heavy, big coffee roast notes have bitterness that also encompasses the hops, coffee notes are so fresh smelling, sweetness is also there, but not too heavy  T: Tastes similar to smell with the flavors even more focused on coffee, again it just has a very fresh coffee taste, the hops come in before that coffee roast though and give you a nice counterbalance to the roast notes, flavors are definitely not heavy, leaves a pleasant creamy aftertaste  M: Body remains relatively light thanks to a good carbonation level, slightly dry which works well with the flavors   D: High, again the flavors are so bright that it is easy to drink  Notes: Just yesterday I had a Ten FIDY and they definitely taste different. Where Ten FIDY goes for big, dark, and heavy flavors, Founders Breakfast goes for bright flavors. Which is really amazing considering that it is such a heavy roasted beer. They pull it off and it is great.
POSITIVE	Poured from the bottle into my Stone IRS snifter. I'm sharing this and some Dirty Bastard with my girlfriend. Interesting to see how the two compare.  A - Brown body with a circle of white head but not much head at all on top. The Backwoods is slightly darker than the Dirty. Not much difference in the two other than that.  S - Caramelly, malty sweetness. Hints of vanilla. But mostly caramel like sweetness  T - Follows the nose with a sweet caramel flavor. Toffee and molasses notes as well. Picking up some nutty flavors and a hint of booze.  M - medium body with a bit of stickiness and a low amount of carbonation  D - A sipper, and I'm kind of glad I am only drinking half a bottle of this. A solid beer but not my favorite style. Certainly enjoyable however and I could see it being the perfect beer if I was in the mood for it.
POSITIVE	A- pours copper penny brown with a nice head that quickly settles.  S- Maplewood smoked bacon....mmmm. Serious smoke comes off of this one. Unmistakable. Hint of sandalwood? Possibly.   T- Follows the nose. I love this beer. The toasted and roasted malts provide a solid body behind the smoky flavor. A sweetness is noted, and is a nice contrast to the smoke. But that's what this beer is all about, and I loooove it.   M- Rich, smoky, wonderful. This beer is a delight.  D- Moderately high. The smoke can get to you, but for me, I f'ing LOVE this beer. In my opinion, this is a unique, fantastic, and one-of-a-kind beer that is prefect for stretching your concepts of what a beer can be. Although it's an old-world technique, this beer can hold its own and even teach a thing or two to modern brewers. Fan-f'ing-tastic, my passion for this beer is almost unrivaled. One of the best beers I've ever had.
NEGATIVE	Poured a nice clear golden color with a thick white head. The head didn't last long. Unfortunately, it does not have a pleasant smell. It smelled like cheap beer or beer spilled two days ago. I was very surprised by the taste...caramel, sweet and tart at the same time, not too bitter. It feels good in the mouth, smooth and filing. I could drink a couple of these, as long as I don't smell it first.
POSITIVE	A- Pours an deep amber brown that has a distinct rosewood color when held up to the light. The 1 finger of head has some staying power and it leaves a sticky lacing as drunk.   S- a lightly biscuity malt scent with some light citrus hops on top.   T- A clean, floral hop flavor opens but is quickly overtaken by a slightly carmely malt. The hops take over again in the aftertaste -- not strong.   M- A fairly dry ESB with a medium body.   D- A wonderfully drinkable beer. While the component, flavor, appearance, etc. Aren't fantastic. A good mouthfeel and taste combine well into a beer that's a real pleasure to drink.
POSITIVE	22oz bottle split into two large snifters  Pours black with no head. Tiny quantities of bubbles drifting along in a lonely fashion. Smells like licorice and liquor.  Taste is very pleasing. Licorice and coffee roasty malts mix together with some bitter burnt toast and nice malty sweetness for a very nice flavor.  Mouthfeel is thick, a little gritty, slightly dry. Overall, forgiven for apparent flatness. It's good.
POSITIVE	Appearence: Pours a nice reddish copper with a thin, near beige head that leaves nice lacing.  Smell: The smell is a pleasent mix of spices and sweet, sticky malts balanced by floral, citrus hops.  Taste and Mouthfeel: The taste is just the average bitter taste of english style beers, without any complexity or depth, and a huge lack of balance. The flavors that are there aren't bad, but just aren't anything special in any way. The mouthfeel is a bit thin and watery.  Drinkability and Overall: This is about as average of an ESB as possible. This is not a hard style to make complex or fun, and this one just doesn't stand up to the test. Stoudt's hasn't been impressing me as much as they used to. It's either the fact that these beers are brewed in Adamstown now instead of Fredericksburg, or my taste in beer and my palate has matured. Let's hope it's the latter.
POSITIVE	First had: on tap at Eulogy, Philly, PA  I've had this on tap a couple times. Tasty, strong, and a bit citrusy. Pours slightly hazy orange-gold with a nice white head that recedes a bit. Pine and grapefruity citrus in the nose. Pine and grass in the taste, with citrus and bitter hops following shortly after, and a mild malt backdrop. Mostly dry finish, with a twinge of alcohol. Medium mouthfeel, and an overall pleasantly drinkable IPA.
NEGATIVE	After reading a forum post about the Best Light Beers, I realized It had been a very long time since I had sampled an Amstel Light, over two years.  The beer pours archetypal lager color a translucent gold, the head impressive in size, brilliantly white in color, the texture creamy and the lace a nice fine clinging sheet to conceal the glass. Nose as expected, all malt, crisp, clean and lightly sweet as it the start. Top is skeletal, the finish is perkily acidic, the hops sparse, but at least present, dry aftertaste, and a decent if altogether to Light for me beer, but not at all bad.
NEGATIVE	Dark brown body with a beige with VERY tight lacing, bubbles stick to the glass perfectly, close to a 5 appearance wise, it could basically just use a longer lasting. Aroma is deeply sweet and eminently complex. A plethora of malty facets. Pretty much every sweet malt flavor is in there, name it you've got it. From candy to licorice, from candi sugar to brown sugar, from prune to cherries coming accross blueberries. This is complex and pure. A delight for the nares. In mouth, the party keeps on going. Add a earthy aspect with notes of ashes and fireplace. Aftertaste is woody. A big malt festivity which I can't help but loving, but I'm forced to recognise the sweetness becomes a little too much, especially if you're thinking of having this whole 765ml to yourself. Body is flawless and more, creamiest brew I've had in a good while, smooth like hell (hell is smooth??) and lager-ish in that sense, but VERY full and chewy. Big props to hopsrus for sending this rare liquid candy treat up the north.
POSITIVE	Thanks to Wasatch for the great trade!  The beer pours a chocolate brown, deep with a little light creeping 'round the edges. Not exactly Mephistopheles, but certainly mischievous. The smell and taste are malty sweet. It is a simple beer, so it is placed in a difficult position, afficionados won't appreciate the simplicity, and neophytes either go for hops or lighter beers, and forget the Bud crowd and others still scared of the dark.  Mouthfeel and carbonation felt right for the style.   Enter the name. Perhaps the saving grace of this beer is a beer from Utah with this name. And at 4% ABV, why not have more than one?  Drink Beer, Be Happy.
POSITIVE	a- bottle poured into a pint, half finger bright white head faded kinda quick, great lacing, bubble ring around the glass, trail of head on the glass on the way down, clear golden yellow color, looks totally refreshing.  s- sharp tang of grain in the nose, almost grapey, nice undertones, grassy notes.  t- really nice pils, tangy, grassy, sweet floral grains, mellows out towards the back.  m- nice, not thin but fills the mouth well.  d- great, this is a go to pils for me, super refreshing, easily sessionable.
POSITIVE	A: black and smooth as it pours into my sniffer. Not much brown head forms, but a quick swirl summons fresh bubbles to the top. Sticky lace, but not overly abundant.  S: holy bourbon, Batman! Huge notes of oak and bourbon, ground coffee, bittersweet chocolate, caramel, toffee, malts, and more bourbon. Complex and potent!  T: follows the nose. Bourbon flavors flow throughout as chocolate, sweet malts, bitter coffee, caramel, and roasted malts each take their turn stepping forward. Finishes sweet and roasty with even more chocolate and warming alcohol. Finish really reminds me of chocolate milk. Fantastic!  M: perfectly carbonated and full-bodied, but not as thick as many of its peers. More body would be helpful.  D: top notch in terms of drinkability. This is a fantastically complex bourbon-centric beer that somehow smooths out the rough edges I often associate with the style. Further proof that Founders is among the nation's elite breweries.
POSITIVE	Light orange body under one finger slowly dissapating white head, exceptional lacing. Floral hops in the nose with light sweetness of malt, not too sweet. A very nice balance of grassy, grapefruit hops with delicate malty overtones on the taste buds. Nice carbonation in mouthfeel, and a very drinkable brew. A very pleasant surprise, looking forward to trying this in cans on a hot summer day.
POSITIVE	Appearance: Pours a black with slight mohagany hues with a very thin layer of head that thins out rather quick.  Aroma: Notes of sherry floral hops in the tail end. Malts are nicely roasted oh so dark. Subtle burnt hop bits but mostly lots of wonderful sugary tid bits.  Taste: Mouthfeel is very smooth sherry dark roasted malts and hops. It does have a sweetness to that is a bit like burnt sugar which not a bad thing at all. A little bit of oats as well.  Notes: This not to shaby of a beer very well rounded. Cheers.
POSITIVE	I had this beer last night on cask. It was dry hopped with Armadillo hops. I was not familiar with this hop varietal but it appears to be similar to Cascade.   Copper in color with a beautiful white creamy head. I love the smell of this beer, it just draws you in. The taste is crisp, fruity, hints of citrus, nice malt balance and very drinkable. I could have sat there all night. The finish is more hops, just the way I like it.  My one question is why do they serve their cask beers cold and not cool or cellar temp? As I allowed this beer to warm up, the flavors where much more pronounced. Oh well, it was still great!
NEGATIVE	This is a beautiful, clear, amber colored liquid with a moderate tan head. The nose is dominantly of toasted malts. Theres a subtle hop floral-ness in the background, framed with a dough and cracker-like smell. The aroma is not particularly strong, but its solid and stable. The taste is malty and sweet, balanced very nicely with the hops. The toasted character stands out in the taste, with a little nut and fruit. It all comes together as a very drinkable beer. An outstanding session brew.
POSITIVE	The beer pours a hazy amber color. The head is frothy, and very thick. The smell is of caramel malt, citrus hops, and a hint of bread. The taste is somewhat creamy. There is an earthy, malt spicy flavor to the beer. The rye plays a good part with this being amber with an orange tint and the earthy spicy malt character. Mouthfeel is medium, not a lot of carbonation. As far as drinkability yeah I could see having a few of these.
NEGATIVE	A - Three fingers of frothy yet fast disappearing white head. Clear and bubbly, golden amber in colour.  S - Some floral sweetness, a bit skunky.  T - Just very mild in every way. Low sweet malt with some lemon juice.  M - Watery thin, with moderate carbonation levels. Mild bitter finish.  O - As with any crap beer, it gets worse as it warms but as long as this is cold it is drinkable.
POSITIVE	12 oz dated bottle into a tulip.  pours black as night and forms a thick, chocolate brown head that hangs around. nice chunky lacing too.  smells of molasses, raisin, alcohol and roasted deliciousness. taste is similar but much more complex. i'm picking up mostly roasted malts, but also some coffee, dark chocolate, molasses, raisin and apple. a dry, bittersweet hop finish gives this one great balance. alcohol content is noticeable, but not overpowering.  mouthfeel is heavy, but also incredibly smooth and creamy with a little bit of alcohol warming.   this beer is quite drinkable for being so strong and rich, bit i couldn't see anyone having more than 2 of these at any given time. fits the style perfectly, and is yet another star in the founders lineup.
POSITIVE	A - Pours almost and dark as used motor oil, with a mild sepia-colored head, and leaves moderate, but creamy lacing.  S - Smell is of roasted espresso, with hints of cocoa, molasses, and caramel. The smell is a bit tame for a beer of this ABV, but what is there is enjoyable.  T - This stout delivers the goods in taste though! Rich, chewy chocolate-like malts, with hints of caramel, molasses, even some vanilla, all balanced by moderate coffee-like bitterness. The malty side isn't shy about showing itself here though.  M - Thick, chewy mouthfeel, and mild, creamy carbonation make for a great sipper.  O - Overall, one of Pike's better offerings I'd say. A great dessert/nightcap/cold day kind of beer.
POSITIVE	650ml bomber poured into Corsendonk chalice jan15 2010  A clear deep amber with a fast falling two finger head after a angry pour that leaves no lace  S lots of caramel apple with some mild booze and hops  T not to far from the smell but some pine and citrus come out that I couldn't smell and the booze is well concealed  M nice and thick even syrupy with low carbonation, pretty decent for this style  D still just a little hot but very well rounded not lacking in any areas and for 10% this is dangerously drinkable   this beer surprised me being so fresh and yet very smooth, I can only wonder what a few years under the stairs would do for this one. I may find out but it will take a little effort not drinking it, pick it up if you get the chance
NEGATIVE	Appearance- slightly hazy amber colored. Fast dissipating head no lacing  Aroma- sweet malt and citrus hop aroma. Need more aroma hops.   Taste- citrusy hops dominate. Very nice. Slight malt backing. Hops are slightly harsh.   Mouthfeel: somewhat astringent. Medium bodied. Fits style.   Drinkability- not the best ipa in the world but suitable for a hot Savannah night!
NEGATIVE	Pours a hazy copper color with a white head that disipates rapidly. The nose is loaded of cascade hops giving it a grapefruit aroma. The front taste is largely of grapefruit though not very overwhelmind with a balance of slight maltiness coming up in the mid with a dry hoppy finish. Light crisp body with carbonation present present on the tounge. With the grapefruit aroma and taste it's a nice breakfast beer.
NEGATIVE	12oz bottle thanks to bret27. Black with a tan head. The aroma has dominating coffee, mixed with plenty of oak and alcohol. Hot flavor with a little bourbon, wood, and coffee. Medium-full body with some tannic, woody astringency and alcohol burn in the finish. A blast of flavor, with a cool mix of coffee and bourbon that works a little better than in the aroma. The mouthfeel definitely brings it down though, with too much astringency and alcohol. This is one that I can see liking a lot better with a good deal of age on it to soften things.
POSITIVE	This is a 12 oz bottle of Benchwarmer Porter, purchased at the brewery following Belgium Comes to Cooperstow 2006. I am drinking the beer from an Ommegang Witte glass and it is served cold.  Appearance: The ale is a deep black color with ruby hints at the sides. There is a small cappucino colored head that laces well.  Smell: The ale has a slight roasted malt nose.  Taste: The roasted malt notes here are fantastic. They provide a hint of chocolate and a lush full flavor that finishes long. This beer has broken the ringwood curse at CBC and tastes quite good.  Mouthfeel: The roasted chocolate notes and hint of sourness are a very pleasant combination.  Drinkability: My last review crowned Back Yard IPA as the best from CBC. This beer takes that title hands down. The flavors are full and unambiguous, giving the beer a real body. This is hereby crowned the best beer at CBC.
POSITIVE	Poured from a stubby 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. Seems nicely carbonated and nearly overflowed with a 1.5" head which began to die down within a minute or two. Clearly should have left the last splash in the bottle as I can see all kinds of sediment throughout the deep amber color beer & even the head.  Upon smelling this beer, I could detect the hops, but unexpectedly was hit with a very malty smell along with it. Probably the maltiest smell I've come across so far in a high ABV IPA. Citrusy and floral notes rise over the malt.   The great balance of hops and malt subdue the 7.2% ABV. This is a well built beer, and although I was hoping for a bolder hop character, the taste is very smooth and pleasing. I detect citrusy and piney flavors up front with the deep roast malt flavor carrying into the aftertaste.   It has a smooth mouthfeel with typical carbonation. I look forward to the remainder of my 6 pack and would recommend this beer to any IPA fan out there with one piece of advice. Leave the last half or quarter inch in the bottle unless you want the sediment.
POSITIVE	500ml Bottle $3.69 Binny's Orland  Schlenkerla's Urbock pours mahogany with explosions of tiny carbonation bubbles rushing to the surface. A two finger dirty white head formed on the pour and eventually fell to a respectable crown leaving patchy lacing on its way down.  While their Marzen has more of a smoky bacon aroma, the Urbock reminds more of strong campfire smoke. There is some nutty and caramel maltiness once I get past the smoke. There seems to be a bit too much smoke in here and it's blanketing the other aromas.   The maltiness is much more pronounced in the flavor than the nose suggested. A bready nuttiness and caramel maltiness end up being a nice compliment to the smoke. The smokiness while still large and in charge is much more subdued than in the aroma.  Medium bodied with a silky smoothness. The carbonation creates a velvety texture on the swallow and the smoke lingers for awhile leaving the feel of a thin film on your tongue.  For a beer with this amount of smokiness this is incredibly easy drinking. Next time I'll pair this with something smoked from the grill.  As this beer warms the malts begin to shine. In my opinion, they were a little heavy handed with the smoked malts but it was a good beer none-the-less. The marzen is still my favorite from Aecht Schlenkerla.
NEGATIVE	Poured into an Anderson Valley tulip from a 22oz bomber purchased May 2007 at Corral Liquor (Granite City, IL - St. Louis metro area).  Deep, dark, rich black. Little to no head on a gentle pour, but some very dark tan edging visible. Subsequent aggressive pours bring a multi-fingered richly carbonated dark tan head that dissipates quickly.  Aroma is thick - bitter chocolate, with sweet syrup coming to the fore as the beer warms.   Taste is perfectly integrated with the smell - massive amounts of rich flavor, coffee-style bitterness fighting (and winning over) some malty sweetness - almost too much going on to process at one time. The taste gets better and less edgy as the beer warms.  Texture is Stone-like - thick syrup. Alcohol burn is minimal - detecible toward the middle of the aftertaste, but not dominant or unpleasant. The sweetness takes forever to dissipate, the bitterness even longer - like many a Stone beer, the overwhelming bitterness overstays its welcome.  Truly a massive beer. Everything's here but the kitchen sink. Ultimately it's not to my taste - I like to preserve my palate for more than just a few sips. But Stone fans and others who want more of everything will enjoy this over-the-top stout.
POSITIVE	Jesus. What the hell's up with this brewery? Last beer I had exploded carbon dioxide in my face, this one, I undo the fastening on the swingtop cap and the cap explodes with a violent pop that leaves my ears ringing and almost lifts the entire bottle off the table. I don't really need a heart attack with my beer.  Pours a deep brown in its stream, in the glass it looks very dark, although when held to light it does show a very deep red-black shining through. Head is frothy, but large bubbled, settling pretty quickly to a film of beige-brown. Lacing is good. Looks pretty decent.  Ooh, nose is very pleasant. Mix of dark fruit, light vinous acidity and a faint whisky-malt smokiness. Really pleasantly mixed together. Way better than I expected for effectively a generic Dark Euro Lager. Sweetness is very pleasant, and the malty, peaty note is very welcome. Really lovely.  Taste is also nice, with a good blend of sweetness, roasted malts and light earthy characters to round out the palate. Light crispness on the back brings it back to its lager roots, but this has a good deal of complexity despite this. Very pleasant.  Great dark Euro lager. Very smooth, but with a pleasant lightness on the palate that leavens the complexity. Drinkable but interesting - it's a great mix.
POSITIVE	Aecht Schlenkeria Rauchbier Marzen into imperial pint glass  Pours a dark cola brown that is deep red and very clear when held to light. A small sand colored head of mainly tiny bubbles sits atop for a decent length.  Aroma is charcoal, fire pit, smoked sausages, black pepper. Smells like summertime BBQ, oh yes.  I feel like I'm drinking smoked sausage. Lots of similarity to the nose, charcoal, burnt woodchips, ground black pepper, a soft malt sweetness, grilled sausages, honey glazed ham. This shit is crazy.  Mouthfeel is moderate with a fairly aggressive carbonation which gives it a feel similar to a soda.  This is actually pretty easy drinking stuff. I was a little reluctant to try this, just because I've never tried a Rauch before, but I dig it. I would love to pair this up with some grilled brats and burgers.
POSITIVE	A: A dark burnt copper with a nice thick and creamy off white head. As it disapates it leaves a thick ring of lacing.   S: This is my first rauchbeir. The the smell is so interesting. There's some pork qualities like hotdogs and bacon. Smells like a fireplaces ashes after a fire has recently burned out. I'm dying to taste this.   T: The smoke taste is lighter then the aroma. It's still pretty much the only flavor though. It's mostly on the aftertaste. It tastes like a smokey ham or hickory smoked bacon.   M: light bodied but really smooth and goes down easily. Light carbonation but it's right on.   Overall: Ive never had a rauchbier and I tend to ignore German beers for some reason. I guess that's kind of wrong considering my great grand parents were born in said country. I liked this beer alot. It's very easy to drink and a great beginer smoked beer. Very nice and I would definitely drink again.
POSITIVE	Basically black with a small beige head.   Small lacings, but the beer reacts beautifully when the glass is swirled.   The aroma is intense - lots of fat malts, molasses, smooth bourbon, dough, and maple syrup. The character is heavy, but it's still fresh and alive. Great integration in the nose.   The taste is almost unbelievable. The body is beyond full and the mouthfeel is beyond smooth and creamy - this is like cream covered in velvet. It is nicely carbonated, which is very delightful. Lovely sweet malty flavor with s smooth bitter accompanying roastiness. Notes of coffee. The barrel character is flawless . smooth toned-down nutty bourbon with hints of wood and vanilla, and sweet fresh maple syrup with hints of honey. A noticeable bitterness develops towards the finish as the beer ends with caramel, toffee, powdery coffee and a hint of alcohol.   This is, from start to finish, a very well made beer. Ridiculously complex, perhaps bordering what is possible with beer without it collapsing in a mess. Here, instead we get great balance and integration. I must say that I find it interesting that the barrel aging made its mouthfeel so full compared to the regular Breakfast stout. Well well, to sum it up: this might be the best barrel aged imperial stout I've ever had.
NEGATIVE	S - 22 oz. bomber with no freshness date. Different Label than the one posted. As the one posted is orange, the label on my bottle is grey with a gent sitting near a smoking fire.  A - Pours a jet black with a nice tawny head with exceptional lacing. head gets to about a finger at its peak and then to a fine bubble film on top of the beer.  S - Chocolate, slight fruit accent, of course smoke, caramelized sugar, roasted malt, a twinge of woodiness too.  T - Slight fruit hits the tongue with a little tartness then the roastiness and sweet caramelized sugar come through all the while the smoke is tapping you on the shoulder. Hits of hops in the corners of the mouth make for a delightful and extremely well balanced beer.  M - Kind of slick while holding on at the same time. Decent carbonation makes for somewhat of a crisp and slightly creamy coat.  D - The smoke character is stong in this brew so I would have to say it would be hard to polish off more than a bomber of it in a single sitting. Good, solid brew. Definitely worth it.
POSITIVE	Pours a golden orange color with a small sticky white head.  Scent of caramel, hops, citrus, pine, apple, alcohol, sweet bourbon and vanilla. Complex and excellent scent.  Taste of vanilla, oak, hops, alcohol, and clove. Strong and tasty, good complexity, but the vanilla and oak are a bit too strong.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied with fairly strong carbonation.
POSITIVE	Finally in Michigan at the right time to grab this one. Pitch black beer with a small head that doesn't do much in the way of lacing. Really a huge flavor and aroma. When it's chilly, it's strong and straightforward on the roasted malt. As it warms up though, you get all kinds of other flavors - sweet dried fruit and raisins in particular, some cherries. Big chocolate, roasted malt. Monster hoppy presence as well, especially in the back of the mouth. Going to drink another and then put a couple down.
POSITIVE	A: Clear copper-amber, off-white head has a little retention and leaves plenty of lace.  S: Fresh Goldings hops (a little citrous, floral and almost soapy clean odour). A little malt sweetness (caramel, slightly nutty), with some fruity esters from the British yeast.  T: Fresh Golding hop flavour, with some good bitterness up front. Balance is kept in check with a little caramel malt sweetness. Some nice, fruity esters round out the finish. Personally, I'm not a big fan of the soapy flavour from the Goldings, but it is a really good brew.  M: Light to moderate body, moderate carbonation.  D: Drinkability is very good.
POSITIVE	Smooth easy drinking pale ale. Clear dark straw with a hint of amber. Light hop aroma.  Very easy drinking with a nice malt character and mild hop flavor. Good as a starter for bitter beer haters.
POSITIVE	My notes from a vertical tasting of KBS 2010 & 2011.  Both beers poured the same black, viscous, liquid with a very thin light brown head. The 2010 had a lot more bourbon on the nose and little less coffee, while the 2011's coffee masked the bourbon scent a bit more. The chocolate scent was underlying in both brews.  Down to the good part. 2010 KBS was so smooth, very creamy, chocolate tasting & sweet. It's still very roasty and malty but the coffee was only an afterthought here with just a hint up front with the bourbon. Not a lot of carbonation here either. This beer was all chocolate, much sweeter than a fresh bottle & a lot less harsh going down with just a hint of alcohol warmth at the end.  2011 breaks the ice with a nice rush of coffee and roasted malts on the initial sip. The chocolate lingers mid taste but with a much stronger roasted malt flavor than the 2010. It is a stout but still comes in at 70 IBUs - the end of the taste finishes with some bitterness but still very, very malty.  I've got to say I'm all in favor of fresh KBS. I like the bite it has & although it isn't as smooth, I think the older bottle was just a little too chocolate & sweet for me - not enough coffee. It's still a spectacular beer from either year & I've still got 1 2010 left to do a 3 year vertical next year but I gotta say - drink it fresh!
POSITIVE	It's ironic that the only other review of this brew is by Nero. We both purchased this brew at the same time in NJ during a trip to a Heavyweight Open House. He drank his immediately, I didn't. It got lost in the fridge. Well, I can report this beauty is alive and well. After over a year and half, the was little or no oxidation. I was surprised as hell.  It poured with a golden, clear body and a massive almost white head. It slowly dissipated but left an abundant collar of lacing all the way to the finish. A pleasant malty aroma was very noticable. The flavor was very tasty with a creamy sweet mouthfeel and a grainy malty overtone. The finish was dry and very refreshing. This is one quite quaffable brew. Helles is one of my favorite style lager.
NEGATIVE	This beer was acquired in a beer trade with Pudge43. Thank you very much!  I have yet to have a Founders product that I didn't like. This is no exception. Poured into a Duvel glass the golden straw color and extremely white fluffy head are beautiful. This is one of the most beautiful double IPA's I've ever had.  The aroma is a little muted but the strong presence of intense fresh hops is present. There is a strong floral and grapefruit aroma.  The first taste is very intense. I thought from the nose that this would be a little lighter in hops but immediately you get a Simcoe hop flavor. The taste is a little harsh and biting but great nonetheless. Very hoppy with very little malt backbone. This is completely unbalanced in a good way.  The mouthfeel is light (much ligher than 9.4% it would seem but that appears to be the strength. The head does lend a rather creamy touch.  Although this is a great tasting beer I would not reach for another in one session. The hop flavor is a little harsh (but good) and the alcohol is a bit high if one were to have more than a couple. This is a great brew with a great character. A big beer from a big brewery. Thank you Founders!
POSITIVE	12 oz. into a pint glass/ no freshness date  P: Honey brown from the bottle, deep amber with orange highlights in the glass. Tan head is nice and creamy with medium bubbles on top. Disappeared quicker than I'd like to a thick halo while leaving some spotty lacing.  A: Citrus, pine, and herbal hops flood the nasal passages, while the rye malt comes through nicely on top of a little booze. Not extremely powerful, but smells very good!  T: Starts pretty hoppy with notes that match the nose. Citrusy, piney, slightly herbal hops are pretty oily and resinous, but I really wish I knew how old this was because they seem like they've faded a bit. Still very good, just not as powerful as they probably once were. Sizeable rye malt holds down the fort and brings that great spicy rye component that I just love, while a hint of caramel is detected underneath. Maybe it's because of the age, but this is very well-balanced right now.   M & D: Medium-full, rich & smooth with a moderate amount of carbonation. Drinkability is great, I just couldn't get enough!  Notes: Why more brewers don't use rye malt in their beers I'll never know. I just love that spicy element that this unique brewing grain brings to the table. I get the feeling that this is just a smidgeon past the "optimal drinking age", but is still quite delicious nonetheless. Straight-forward and to the point, very nicely done!
POSITIVE	A - A one finger tan head sits on top of a pitch black brew with slight ruby highlights. Big waves of lace, with minimal stickage. The head quickly reduces to a thin collar.  S - Burning rubber, BBQ smoke, roasted nuts, tree bark, mesquite, beef jerky, and salt&pepper. Very woodsy and smoky, but a little weak.  T - Wood fire, smoky mesquite BBQ, and beef jerky. Not quite as complex as it smells, and its missing a lot of the core porter flavors, although I can taste some strong dark roast coffee.  M - Crisp and carbonated with a lighter body. IMO, this is a bit over carbonated, and after letting it sit a while to warm the carbonation became less raspy and more creamy.  D - Pretty damn thirst quenching for a smoky porter. Not offensive in any way, and mellow enough for those who don't like smoked beers, but I wish it was more assertive.
POSITIVE	12oz. bottle courtesy of kmpitz2.  Pours a clear chestnut brown with a creamy tan head that thins. Speckled lacing on the glass.  Aroma is malty and nutty with some cocoa notes. Very nice.  Malty and nutty taste right upfront with hints of cocoa. Finishes rather clean with a lingering nutty/cocoa taste.  Body seems thin, carbonation is good.  Even with the somewhat thin body, this is still a very nice brown ale. I would gladly drink several more.
NEGATIVE	Dark, coke-color with sticky, lace-inducing head. Aroma of yeast, burnt coffee beans and a strange quality (that I must assume is due at least in part to the rye) that reminds me of rising bread dough crossed with a pool liner. On the palate, zesty hops give way to sweet-and-spicy malts that possess an earthy, still-fermenting quality. Full carbonation pumps up the gravity artificially, but not unpleasantly -- I'd say the mouthfeel is actually the best aspect of this beer. Overall, this experiment in rye is interesting but not terribly drinkable, and not terribly memorable. Only OK.
POSITIVE	Appearance: Pours an amber brown with small white head and good lacing.  Smell: Wow, smells like smoked sausage most definitly. Along with a slight sweet smell makes this smell delicious.  Taste: It's like drinking summer sausage. The smoky flavour carries this brew and adds great enjoyment to my drinking. I have never had any beer like this before and I like it. Leave it to the Germans to make a beer that tastes like sausage I guess. Small citrus taste in the finish, but lingering smokiness fills your mouth. Incredible.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied, very robust and quenching. Small ammount of carbonation if any.  Drinkability: Ummm... Drinkable if you like sausage. I do, but it's hard to finish the whole thing. Share with friends or drink with food.  Interesting beer to say the least. Try again with a German dinner to ensure a great evening.
POSITIVE	Slightly hazy orange color with minimal head or lacing.  The aroma is pure citrus - mostly orange with some grapefruit on the side. The flavor is pure hops - again mostly citrus, with some pine flavors toward the finish. Any malt flavors are pretty well hidden.  Mouthfeel is smooth and juicy, punctuated with a peppery prickle (from the alchohol?). But overall this is a very drinkable beer. It is not as complex as some of the top IIPA's, but very enjoyable, a well made beer, worth seeking out.
POSITIVE	A: Poured into a chalice. Pours very dark black and no head, but its was cold at 36F  S: I let it warm until 50f to review: Nice, very strong but smooth bourbon or Kentucky straight whiskey notes.with coffee and Vanilla notes. I also detect a bitter chocolate whiff.  T: its strange though your nose is telling you your drinking strong bourbon, your mouth is tasting, a stout with strong chocolate, vanilla, and oak, lots of caramel malt, no hops detected period. I don't taste any coffee, because the bourbon taste pretty much overloads everything at first.  M: Silky and heavy, very heavy in fact. Its a stout, a Imperial Stout at that, no mistaken that here.  D: Well since I only bought 2 I cannot really say, but I want another one, just not going to pay the mail order price, but these 2 were damn fine beers.
NEGATIVE	On tap at Oregon Brewer's dinner.  A - Poured a hazy copper-gold, with 2 fingers of white head. Dissipates slow and left beautiful lacing.  S/T - Honey, flowers, bananas, and citrus hops.  M - Light bodied, hop dominated, thin, and sweet.   D - Not bad. Would recommend adding crystal malts and letting this one fully attenuate to reduce the hop dominance of this tripel.
POSITIVE	Pours a hazy amberish orange with a finger and a half of creamy yellow tinged head that leaves small amounts of misplaced lacing as it quickly drops to a paper thin covering. The nose is full of high quality ganja buds, citrus and pineapple and fresh cut pine stand out. The hoppy flavors are direct,but not forceful or overwhelming. A malty under current offsets the bold hops and offers a balanced brew that I think hop haters could even appreciate. A medium bitterness keeps this IPA cruising just the way I like,creamy and light,the finish is unique and one of a kind.
POSITIVE	This headless hefe was served in a typical tumbler at the CBC. The mild banana, clove and grain aroma was a pleasant invitation to enjoy this mild and refreshing ale. While the fruit and clove flavors were a bit mild, I enjoyed the interplay with the wheat notes. There is no horrifying American wheat beer flavor in the ale, which seems to be a mild, wheatier variant of the Triple Threat. It's a nice seasonal offering.
POSITIVE	This is it. Review No.1000.  This beer pours a pitch black color, dark as night with a brown one-finger head into my fancy Piraat glass.   The aroma is rich and creamy with a strong whiff of bourbon from the barrels, chocolate and vanilla in the nose. A bit of roasted coffee peeks out as well.  The taste is nice and creamy upfront with a strong bourbon presence that increases as it warms up. A good hint of both chocolate and coffee are still there but the bourbon and alcohol seem to dominate.  The mouthfeel is full of warm bourbon and lingering bitter coffee and chocolate. Again, the bourbon dominates the palate.   This is a very good example of the style. However, I should have aged it for a while. Still quite drinkable while young and it doesn't take away from the potential that this beer has. The aroma is intact but the taste needs some age.
NEGATIVE	Bottled 1/4/2002. Consumed 12/30/2003.  For a beer that's a few days short of two years old, this one has aged pretty well. Poured a deep golden, almost amber color with a frothy white head. Darker than expected, but attractive nonetheless.  Nose of yeast, pepper, coriander and alcohol. Seemed closed, but the spicy aromas certainly came out.  The peppery, coriander spiced flavor was most prevalent. A strong doughy aspect was also vibrant, adding character. Some tropical, ripe fruit also came through on the finish with a mild, earthy hop character.   Full, round mouthfeel with a hint of creaminess and minor astringency.   Certainly drinkable, while some alcohol presence lingers. While not the best Belgian-style tripel I've consumed from a domestic brewery, it's well done. Lacking in the aromatics and drinkability department, this is still a nice tripel that has aged quite well.
POSITIVE	12 ounce bottle poured into a Piraat glass.  Appearance is dark...black and very opaque. There is a nice creamy tan head, about half a finger, sitting on top.  The aroma is quite sweet...smells of sweet brown sugar, molasses, wheat bread, caramel, dark chocolate, and vanilla.  The taste is good...hints of vanilla in the background, and molasses. These give way to some serious chocolate notes. There are some spices in there, as well. Cinnamon, nutmeg. It's a very sweet imperial stout...like a syrupy sweet.   Overall, this is a solid Imperial Stout...one I've grown quite fond of. I'm glad this has been put back into Founders's rotation. It has some excellent flavor, and great body.
NEGATIVE	Poured into a pint glass. Pours a dark cherry color, with virtually no head. Spotty lacing.  Smells like scotch, cherries and licorice. Hints of caramel, raisins and maple.  Taste serious licorice, cherries, some raisins, fig and malt, a nice oak and vanilla aftertaste. A nice bitterness.  Mouthfeel is syrupy. Full-bodied and smooth with a little tingle.  Nice sipper. Not too complex on the palate, but still a really interesting brew.
POSITIVE	12 oz. bottle poured into a pint glass.  Pours cloudy deep amber with a couple fingers' worth of light beige, foamy head with just a little bit of stickiness around the edges. Head diminishes somewhat quickly, but leaves a decently thick foamy film across the surface.  Sweet, dried tropical fruit aromas at first whiff, with a little bit of citrus peel lurking in the background and just a touch of earthiness to mellow things out. Interesting.  On the tongue, 5 Day IPA is noticeably balanced; there is no one thing grabbing my attention. The dried tropical fruit notes are there, but to a considerably lesser extent than in the nose. Strong malt backbone, with a mildly biscuity bent. This doesn't really strike me as an IPA. There's a mild lingering bitterness  Light to medium bodied, but on the thin side. Lots of small bubbles on the tongue. Drinkability is just kind of meh. There are plenty of other IPAs I'd rather have, and at the price point I'd not think twice about reaching for something else. This is, however, the first time I've had this in a bottle, and though I took no notes before this isn't as good as I remembered; perhaps it has lost something as a contract brew?
POSITIVE	Poured from 22oz bottle into a tulip glass.  Appearance: Pours pitch black with a half finger of mocha colored foam that settles down quickly.   Smell: Roasted malt, roasted coffee, dark chocolate.   Taste: Dark chocolate, coffee and roasted malt.  Mouthfeel: Full bodied and creamy.  Drinkability: Overall a pretty decent deal (I think I paid $3.99 for this at Total Wine) for an decent beer. Nothing Earth-shattering, but really solid.
POSITIVE	Again, I've found an IPA that is well worth not only having again, but stocking the refrigerator. Nice presentation from Centennial, a finger of froth with a cider orange body. Good nose, strong on hops--as with the very good taste--but subtle on the fruit, which comes out better in the taste, which was very good. Lots more fruit in the taste than the nose, with apples, orange peel, lemon, and grapefruit accosting the taste buds. Excellent.  This is something I'll be sure to grab again. The dense hops are well incorporated, front and center but smooth, with a sterling mouthfeel keeping the flavors in harmony. Very good brew.
POSITIVE	Picked this up recently up in Totowa. I heard a lot about this beer and this was pretty heavily hyped. This wasn't a disappointment by any stretch of the imagination, but maybe I've had too many RIS's and this just doesn't measure up to some of the others that I've enjoyed. Regardless of that, this was a solid beer that packed quite a punch!  This had a decent pour to it - nice, dark, and coffee-like. It was a bit thinner than I thought and didn't have that "motor-oil" feel to it. Instead, this is thin, roasted, and strong! Lots of coffee, toffee, and a bit of dark chocolate here. Not terribly bitter, not the smoothest, but it went down nicely and had an aftertaste like a coffee with a few creams in it. If you're after a bitter stout, this isn't it. Instead, this would be better suited as a introduction to this style, for those who aren't used to something so intense.  Personally, I wish this was a bit lighter on the alcohol. It feels stronger than 9.40%, but I don't consider it a knock on the beer. It's a personal preference and looking at the bigger picture, Hoppin' Frog has something good here. I'd love to try their other offerings, even though if I have another RIS again, it's pretty unlikely that I'd reach for this. Not an easy choice with so many stellar choices out there!
POSITIVE	Managed to get one of twelve bottles at Abe's on the day of it's release. The beer poured out as a very dark black color, nice and thick oily looking body with a brown colored head on top. The head lasts for a little bit and fades in time. The smell of the beer is sweet and lightly roasted with some maple, chocolate and coffee aromas. The first sip is sensational, I couldn't believe how great this tasted. The blend of maple and coffee was fantastic. Such an interesting flavor it's hard to explain. The mouthfeel of this brew is creamy, thick and rich. Overall this beer is great. There isn't many other ways to explain how good this is. Makes me wish I could have gotten more. So glad that I got to try this beer finally.
NEGATIVE	Pours out Budweiser style with just a tad of foam. Smell is strong grain alcohol with just a tad of wheat. Taste is a bit more bitter than Bud and at twice the alcohol level. I really don't get a lot of flavor here but what flavor I do get is very grainy and just a little caramel malty . You really can't taste the alcohol here so this must be a pretty good beer.
NEGATIVE	my 100th review  Well, not as dark as sinebrychoff, but certainly dark brown to black, with a khaki rocky head that laces very well. Smells of dust, faint chocolate, very light roast and rubber, go figure. Great flavors. Semisweet chocolate, roast coffee, cherry, almonds, brown sugar. Very nice. Unfortunately, as much as i want to like this, i find it overly sweet, cloying. Mouthfeel is good, medium, assertive carbonation, medium body. Drinkability suffers due to sweetness. Oh well. Drain pour.  Give me sinebrychoff any day.
POSITIVE	The recipe must have changed some, as this is now listed on the menu as 7.0% ABV.   Hazy pumpkin topped with a packed beige foam. Scented of grapefruit rind, spruce, and crushed lilacs, backed with sweetbread malt. Begins with a dryish breadiness. Almost cracker-like at first, then expanding into sweeter notions of caramel and apple. The hops hit, full of Cascade cues, all citric acid, pine pitch, and florals.  It's neither overly big, nor over bittered. This is well balanced in its medium structure and low carbonation. Geared towards drinkability more than anything. An all around solid, basic IPA.
POSITIVE	Hazy straw edges with bubbly orange center, frothy white head with good retention and lacing. Light sweet floral aroma. Strong alpha hop lightly sweet citrus/floral quickly gives way to resinous hop then melding to a light barley and yeasty finish. Moderately high hop linger nicely settles to an unusually, precariously balanced position. Slick and syrupy with no stickiness.  Not a whole lot of clear flavors but well-crafted and interesting display of ingredients. Strong but never overbearing, its particularly interesting without a big malt backbone. It may be as much as 6 months old (the dates were smudged) but it still has an interesting quality, possibly because of the yeast strain. At any rate, I easily downed 2 and would hope to try on tap at some point.
POSITIVE	Wonderful style of beer, that unless you are drinking Fraoch, well, where the heck are you going to be able to drink this style of beer on tap in the USA? Pours a cloudy copper color, and the aroma has the fresh smell of flowers. It's medium bodied with very nice carbonation. I don't get any real sweet tastes from this, more of a flowery finish...I believe that there is also lavender in this along with the heather...a very interesting, refreshing, and unique beer. pat
POSITIVE	Appearance - sunset orange/amber pour, three fingers of pillowy foam. Recedes, leaving craters across the top and creating a very uneven surface with clumps of lace strewn about.  Aroma - fruity, fresh and juicy hops, like pineapple, orange, and a hint of pine.  Taste - good base malts. Sweet caramel, toasty. The hops segue the sweetness to usher in the fruity side first. On the swallow, they go bitter with dryness, grapefruit rind, and some warming alcohol. A nice ring of hoppiness at the finish with a little reprise of biscuity grain. A little sharp but tasty. Has an almost peppery flavor as it warms.  Mouthfeel - smooth, its got a little weight to it, could use a little more though.  Drinkability - a finely balanced and drinkable IPA. Pushing the abv yes, but this bomber went fast.
NEGATIVE	12oz. bottle into pint glass  A. Golden with amber hue, 2 finger head fades to just a small layer, very clear and without sediment  S. Very mild, trying to pull hops out of this but really am getting more of a granola sweet scent  T. Piney and Earthy flavors are present, but bready malts are prominent and while not overly sweet very noticeable. Slight off metallic aftertaste.  M. Refreshing, good carbonation level, finish is clean and crisp.  O. Average IPA, label reads "where do we go now?" and I say more hops, more hops, more hops.
POSITIVE	Pint sampled in the Market Porter, London on the 13th November 2006...  Poured pretty black with some ruby hints just coming through... Creamy brown head poured pretty thickly then faded to light ring around the edge... barely any carbonation... very light lacing...  Aroma - Nice roasted chocolate maltiness, molasses / dark brown sugar notes, creamy milkiness, coffee, light blackcurrent fruitiness, some peppery hops, light liquorice...  Taste  Roasted maltiness, creamy dark chocolate with some bitterness, some liquorice notes, light fruits (blackcurrents, some prunes), some oatiness, nice light brown sugar sweetness, nice peppery hops, light burnt toffee notes...  Feel - Velvety smooth... Pretty full bodied. Very drinkable...  Overall - An amazingly well balanced stout - served perfectly at the Market Porter... Highly recommended...
POSITIVE	Pours a dark cola color with about one finger of tan colored head. Retention is decent, not much in the way of lace. Aroma is of roasted malt, espresso, bittersweet chocolate, and a bit of dark fruit.   Taste is a bit nutty with, lots of coffee flavor, a bit of chocolate, and a little licorice in the finish. Nice level of roasted bitterness. Nice smooth mouthfeel, and very easy drinking. A great porter.
POSITIVE	16oz. bottle poured into a tulip glass.  Appearance-Medium copper in color, slightly hazy, moderately low off white head with some lacing and fair retention.  Aroma-Smoke, oak, bacon, charcoal, this is the holy grail of smoked beer aroma. Very light toast and a little bit of sweet caramel perceptible as well. No hops. As it warms, it almost develops a hint of fruit in the aroma, like apple-wood smoked bacon.  Flavor-Slightly less smoke in the flavor allows other malt characteristics to shine through. Nutty, toasty, caramel, smoky, bready, yummy goodness. Perfectly balanced between smoke and malt characteristics. No hops. No notable alcohol flavors.  Mouthfeel-Medium light mouthfeel. Medium low carbonation. Smooth as hell with some alcohol warmth.  This is such an awesome beer. I honestly think it's one of the best balanced smoked beers I've ever had. Fan-fucking-tastic.
POSITIVE	figured this would be a good place to start for my first review since it's the best beer I've ever had and prolly ewill have this year  Bottled 2-25-11 poured into New Belgium Globe  A- Jet black with dark brown mocha head that sticks around for awhile... Looks beautiful  S- Bourbon and vanilla dominate, with hints of coffe and chocolate.. Alcohol.. Just incredible  T- Where to begin so complex and smooth and balanced it's ridiculous... Bourbon dominates just like aroma up front, lingering into a awesome dark chocolate/coffee taste that stays long after it's gone... High ABV is masked perfectly and is there just enough to warm ya up....Tons if oaky bourbon flavor as it warms  M- perfect.... Coats the mouth with all the flavors and clings on to ur  tastebuds forever, good minimal carbonation and incredibly smooth  O- Founders is one of the best and they never fail to remind you of that with KBS. best stout money can buy imho... Had a ton of gre at stouts over the winter and can honestly say this beer is worth the hunt and money you will go through/pay from here on out... Look forward to  having the rest in the future
NEGATIVE	From tap into pint glass.   Appearance - This recipe has to have changed since eballard's review of "This beer comes a dark black color. So dark that you can hardly see any light pass through it at all." As of this writing the beer is a clear (see through) brown.  Smell - Big time coffee aroma! Really nice job getting that aroma out of the malts used.  Taste - Caramel malts possibly? Nice tasting beer.  Mouthfeel - not much to report. Average mouthfeel.  Drinkability - perfectly drinkable beer.  This is clearly a different recipe than has been reviewed by some others. I know that the brewer told me he changed the recipe for the Rajah IPA from 2006 to 2007. Did he change this recipe? Did the bartender pour me a brown instead of the porter? I don't think so. She asked me if I wanted the vanilla Porter or the regular and I said the regular so I'm sure she was paying attention. Bizarre.
POSITIVE	On-tap at Haymarket. Served in a 4oz taster glass.  A - Looks nearly identical to Mathias Jr. Maybe a bit more lace.  S - The Citra hops are more front and center here compared to its bigger brother. Lots of tropical fruits, zesty citrus, and a bit of dank earthiness as well. Malt character is more understated - minimal sugar flavor present and no booze either.  T - Taste is zesty citrus, tropical fruits, and tangerines filling things out. Tastes nearly identical to the aroma actually. More of a West Coast beer than regular Mathias, as the malt character is largely in the periphery. Bitterness is surprisingly low.  M - Carbonation is a bit more restrained thankfully. Body is medium, with an extremely dry finish, and again plenty of oily hop resins lingering.  D - I actually think this is the best of the Mathias line - it's lower in ABV and malt character, with an extremely dry, crisp finish. I think I'd prefer if they made this one the regular offering. In any case, recommended.
POSITIVE	surprised by pour. was expecting it to come out very dark based on the name.  Pours out amber/copper with a small head that is gone quickly. slight carbonation noticeable in glass.   biscuit malt off the nose. grassy hops. not a strong aroma but very pleasing.  good bitterness, refreshing and a bit of malty sweetness. bitterness lingers long after the sip. a little bit of yeast flavor and minerality. really good bitterness.   nice stuff.
NEGATIVE	Well, if you like ham in a bottle, this beer is for you. This is my first experience with a smoked beer that actually tastes like smoke. I've tried a couple others, but none have tasted like this.  The nose is very smoky, very much reminiscent of smoked ham. Just a touch of wheatiness in the nose. The taste is also quite smoky, with a good bit of wheaty sourness lurking in the background; finishes with a light sweetness. The smoke is offset nicely by the wheat, but I think, following a previous reviewer's suggestion, that a bit more heft to this beer, some more munich malt maybe, would really be good. A little too light for all this smoke. Overall, its an interesting beer, but I wouldn't have more than one.  I also have to say that this brewer's website is first rate. Great info on all aspects of beer production, especially the production of smoked malt. Also great pics of their products.
POSITIVE	This beer was purchased as a sixer from Wine and Beer Westpark in Glen Allen, VA - fresh - poured into a tulip - live review - the beer is in front of me.  This beer. mama mia.  Black as night and just damn sexy lookin. The head is perfect and the carb is perfect. The crown is a mocha color that leaves a trail of tight lacing behind. Smells dark.. yeah. Smells of roasty malts with coffee and bittersweet chocolate Tastes like love. Honestly I really don't have words. Perfect balance of bittering hops and malt sweetness with a pinchy bite on the back of the tongue from the dark malts bitterness.  I want to shake the hand of the man or woman that brewed this beer.  Go buy it or trade for it. I have not personally had KBS or FBS but this is the best of 4 founders beers I've had. get it. now.
POSITIVE	Pours a hazy, golden color. Gigantic fluffy head that sounded like a bowl of Rice Krispies for about 10 seconds; lots of lacing. The carbonation sits heavy in the head but consists of random bubbles elsewhere.   Massive aroma of piney, citrus hops mixed with mild, sugary malt. Notes of butterscotch, cilantro, and spicy bread.  Silky on the tongue that leads to a firm crisp feel. A blanket of hops converge into a sour-pine flavor that adds grapefruit, lemon, butter rum and rounds out with a boozy, moderate bitterness. The mouth is left somewhat numb with a film that lingers; brown sugar malt also in the after taste.   A very solid beer all-around and a hop lovers delight. Founders is one of my favorite breweries where I have yet to sample a poor offerig. Pick up one of these four packs and I hope to see more of this in the future.
NEGATIVE	This beer poured a golden color with a huge fluffy head. The smell is of sweet bready malt. The taste is sweet malt with some other sweet characteristics of honey with a dry finish and a small amount of hops. The mouthfeel is nice and thick, with a middling amount of carbonation. This beer is certainly drinkable, but I can't imagine myself grabbing more than one at a time.
NEGATIVE	Poured a red brown with little head. Strong aroma of smoke and little else.As for taste, this is my first try of a smoked beer. I can't decide if this is good or not, because the smokiness is overpowering! There just doesn't seem to be anything else there. The smell reminds me of a campfire that has been doused with water, and the smell of the hot steaming coals. Not something I think I'd try again.
POSITIVE	Picked this beer up from A-Wines in Inman Square. Lets see how it is compared to the regular Breakfast Stout. Not a shred of light was getting through the blackness of this brew. A small tan head also gave way to a brown lace. In the aroma were traces of smooth chocolate, coffee beans, whiskey, and some earth tones. Taste started off slightly acidic, then turned to burnt coffee and roasty bitterness. All the while there is a big background of fudgy chocolate.Mouthfeel, needless to say, is quite big, although the alcohol is not all that pronounced. This is an incredibly smooth brew; very silky, and big on flavor. At this point in the review, I have been drinking this one too fast, I will definitely be slowing down to let more of the complexities of this beer pull through. Although this beer was really expensive, it is so worth it. Definitely liked this one more than the normal Breakfast Stout. Founders continues to amaze me. This goes in as one of the best beers I have yet to sample. Cheers
POSITIVE	Tasted by half-pint at the NWAF 06, Manchester, 18/01/06. Gravity-dispensed. It was tasted after being announced as the Silver medallist in the Barley Wines category in the competition, so I can't say there is no biase in favour of it in my review~~ but here you go, nice and fresh on cask!!! Yeah~~ I'm the first one here to review this beer in its cask-conditioned form!!!  A: pours an amber hue, coming with very thin bubbly head... against a low carbonated body... from a very fresh barrel and just the look one should expect from a gravity-dispensed pint. S: thick... preserved dates and plums, sour-sweet fruity notes, creamy maltiness... overall not too alcoholic and not too sugary~~ quite smooth and nice. But overall it's less buttery and oily than a Scottish Wee Heavy, rather like an English Barley Wine. T&M: tea and caramel mingle so well on the palate upfront, slowly leading to a chewy malty, tea-ish, and slightly plum-pudding-ish aftertaste with lots of spices and mixed preserved fruits to play with. Rather dry and hoppy finish with residual fruitiness down the palate. Extremely light on the mouthfeel yet ever-changing in the flavour profile... this is a lively, vertically-structured, strong barley wine but superbly drinkable almost like an apperitif!! Well done Isle of Skye~~
POSITIVE	On tap at the brewery.  Light copper beer with 3/4 inch head. Smell give both hop dryness as well as the rye. Taste was a relative complex balance of citrus hops, some piney and grassy hops, and rye with enough of malty backbone to hold it together. A good sipping beer and worth a try.
POSITIVE	Really a nice balanced easy drinking pale ale with a lot of character. Fresh and floral on the nose...similr hop impression on the flavor but more malt than expected here...kind of a caramel drizzled biscuity malt flavor....drinks easy...medium bodied at best....perhaps more of a light medium bodied...very nice pale ale.
POSITIVE	A - Dark...almost black and thick looking. An aggressive pours yields about half an inch of mocha colored head that recedes quickly. Thin, spider-web lacing.  S - After the initial pour a wave of citrus and pine resin hits the nose. A little time yields a chocolate laden malt aroma. When I close my eyes and sniff I swear someone is holding a navel orange in front of my nose.  T&M - Admittedly I'm not getting "barleywine" out of this. My taste buds say a highly hoped stout, but maybe that's just me. Hops from the nose are subtler in the taste but still present. Roasted chocolate malt with hints of espresso and coffee bean. Smooth and creamy with a somewhat dry and earthy finish.  D - Alcohol is very well disguised, and the creamy smoothness makes it easy to drink. I recall liking the 2009 quite a bit, and I think this is better. I also think this one has great age potential. Highly drinkable.
NEGATIVE	Incredibly foamy, I got a glass full of head. Golden amber with what settles to a merinque like white head, leaves puffy white rings of lacing. Nice hoppy aroma, floral and pine, light citrus but mainly floral. Pale malt in the background. Floral, citrus zest and caramel taste, nice malty base - biscuit and toast. Mainly floral with caramel. A little too 'thin' I would have prefered a more robust taste, especially for the higher ABV. Medium bodied.
POSITIVE	This beer will serve two wonderful milestones for me. It is the 800th beer I've tried and the 300th beer I've reviewed on BeerAdvocate.  A short lived one three finger head is almost pink in color, which I found quite appropriate for the style. Body is a very deep burgundy. Nose is full of purreed raspberries, rugbarb, and a prequil of sweet tartness. A long creamy tartness is actually silky as you take first sip. A minerally vegetable laced sweet and sour battle ingages on the back of the tongue. This has been called a bigger version of Rubeaus, but this really is its own unique brew. Twords the end of the palate you get a distinct bit of dryness that really balances out the tartness. There really is a lot of complexity going on within the palate of this beer. Alchol is completely hidden. Mouthfeel is fruity dry thick tartness. An exceptionally drinkable sipper.
NEGATIVE	Bottle: Poured a light clear copper color ale with a small foamy head with OK retention and no lacing. Aroma of cinnamon and nutmeg is quite dominant and very enjoyable. Taste is also dominated by loads of cinnamon and nutmeg with lightly sweet malty backbone. Body is a bit light for style with average carbonation. I really enjoyed the spicing of this beer but the malt presence was a bit low for my own taste.
POSITIVE	far and away the best scotch ale I've ever tasted. This distinct flavor has placed it among my favorite all-time beers. After trying if for the first time on tap at founders brewery in Grand Rapids I was quite pleased to find it near my home in Illinois...
POSITIVE	2010 Batch 11/30/2010  Appearance: rich black little to no head what is does not stay. Smell: lovely roasted malt punctuated with notes of sweet bourbon.  Taste: slightly bitter intertwined w/ rich coffee & dark chocolate, subtly smoky with roasted malt. Finishes w/ sweet notes of bourbon.  Texture: dry.  Drinkability: for this style incredibly so no flavor kills another but w/ this abv will make you reign it in. Value: it takes great ingredients to make a great beer and you will pay more for it. There are many reasons this is limited.
POSITIVE	Nice slightly murky amber color. Very appealing foamy head with lots of sticky lacing left behind.  Aroma is a blend of fruity hops with a slight belgian yeast scent.  Taste is excellent - leans more towards the IPA side with the bitter & fruity hops dominating the palate.  Easy to drink and nicely carbonated - I would definitely drink this again.
NEGATIVE	poured into a tulip  A.  pours pretty much black. a little head that dissipates very quickly. a very nice looking beer.  S.  amazing smell. bourbon, oaky, bitter chocolate and roasted coffee. Subtle notes of vanilla as well.   T.  awesome. perfect amount of bourbon taste. then you get the standard breakfast stout flavors in there. the coffee and chocolate notes. A little sweet tasting as well.  M.  medium to heavy bodied. smooth and a little creamy. Not too carbonated. just perfect.  D.  Ii'll definitely be on the lookout for this. But it's a little difficult to find and the alcohol content is kinda high. Would be hard to have often. I will definitely go outta my way to get this however.
POSITIVE	Picked up a 750, crown-cap finished bottle of this Italian Saison style beer at one of my favorite local shops and brought it home hoping for, even expecting, great things. Why? Well, because I'm a Saisonophile, I've really enjoyed the Italian artisanal brews I've tried to date, and the price was, well, more than twice that of a DuPont, nearly three times a Hennepin.  As I popped the top about five bucks worth of beer gushed onto the countertop with an impressive "pop" from the bottle. Well carbonated? Check!  Began to pour and quickly piled up a mountain of rocky, meringue-like foam. Check!  Color is a slightly hazy light orange-amber...very appropriate for Saison. Check!  Put the snifter to my nose--of course I used a snifter!!--and drew in the sweetest, freshest breath of noble hops. Light and complexified with spicy yeast notes and citrus. Very appropriate, and very nice. Check!  STarted drinking and quickly progressed to quaffing. Light-medium body, clean dry finish, delicate hops and spice and a refreshing wheaty acidity. Check and double-check.  At 6% ABV, this is a very drinkable, refreshing, moderately complex, nicely balanced, and highly refreshing ale. What else would I want from a Saison?  What is missing? Well, not a lot of malt complexity. Not the caramel candy tones of some Belgian Saisons, but a clean, refreshing wheat beer character. Very restrained and refined hops.   This is a beer I could drink lots of, all summer long, except I can't and won't because it cost me $22 a bottle. Damn shame about that! I suppose the expense is in the importing and distribution, but this beer costs at least twice as much as it should. It would be very very nice at half the price.  Worth trying and enjoying, but unless you have way more discretionary funds than I do, don't think about it as the best summer refresher to come along in a while. But if your rich, this just might be the lawnmower beer you're looking for.
POSITIVE	I enjoyed this beer from the comfort of my own living room while passing out candy to the trick or treaters. From the 12oz bottle to a standard pint glass.  Appearance: Pours a dark orange color with a thin off-white head that disappeared pretty quickly.  Smell: Light pumpkin pie spices but not much else.  Taste: Pumpkin pie spices with a cinnamon and nutmeg finish.  Mouthfeel: Thin to medium-bodied and a nice crisp finish.  Drinkability: A little bit light on the flavor and aroma side. Was hoping for more, but still a pretty decent beer.
NEGATIVE	A: Straw yellow and very clear. 2 finger head rapidly dissipates.  S: very malty, sour aroma.  T: Bitter hops, corn and malts add to the sweetness.   M: Light as it gets. Crisp, refreshing beer.  Overall: Light beers are why I thought I didn't like beer in my early drinking days. But I want to try as many as I can and light beers are still beers.
NEGATIVE	Of the three maibocks our group has tasted so far, this was by far the favorite, easily beating out the Golden Fleece (which was too malty) and the Dead Guy (which we still don't believe is a maibock in any but the most technical sense).  People enjoyed the verdant, springy aroma and taste. They thought the beer was a solidly drinkable one, even if some complained that it was "missing something" in the way of being a complete success.
NEGATIVE	Very rich IPA, dark, malty looking pour, but with the first sip, I realize how hoppy this beer is. Very hoppy, indulgent offering from Founders. Very tasty and rich, I was very satisfied with this beer, well balanced hops and malt, as well as a fruity flavor mixed in.
POSITIVE	Yellow bottling code is illegible, 2011.  Poured into a Founders pint glass a deep amber brown with a thin tan foamy head that retains well. Nose is caramel malts, dark fruit, molasses. Taste is much the same; roasted and sweet caramel malt base, bit of fruit at the back and a scotch like mildness accompanied by brown sugar. Medium to heavy body, oily texture. Overall, a very easy drinking ale, good to sip on throughout the fall like evenings.
POSITIVE	Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass.   The Founders Double Trouble pours opaque and golden brown forming an off-white creamy head. The head dissipates evenly leaving whisps of lacing along the glass.   The beer has aromas of fresh hops and citrus with nice fruit malt backbone, with hints of banana.   Bitter hop goodness assaults the tongue but is mellowed by a nice and balanced malt. The alcohol is noticable right before the long, slightly bitter and citrus/hop-flavored finish. Throughout the beer there are hints of pineapple/banana fruitiness (super-suttle hints).   This beer has a medium body with good carbonation, but it finishes quite lightly.   The DT is very easy to drink, with the alcohol making its presence known without ruining the party. This was the first beer from Founders that I ever had, and it is probably my favorite. Great effort from a great brewery.
POSITIVE	Pours a just-hazey orange-tinted amber with a finger-thick, bone white head that shrinks back to a sticky topcoat. Little hop bits and streams of bubbles meander around in there.  Flowery hop nose mixes with carmel malts and a sweet fruity character. Dry hopped and proud.  Very hoppy taste. A blossoming floral flavor, warming alcohol is tucked away nicely and a resiny pine taste shoulders its way in. Mmmm-mmmm. Dry, bittering floral finish.  Full in the mouth, slightly oily and a bit puckering.  A quality, quality brew. This is one I go back to often. It's a great example of the American IPA and a treat regardless of style. Cheers to Founders.
POSITIVE	Open bottle and pour into glass and immediately catch the great aroma. Pours a nice, lightly hazed, dark orange, with a decent head, leaves great lacing on the glass.   This beer has an incredible aroma, a great, bright, hops/citrus/grapefruit/floral smell, very strong, but not too much for the style. Great hop dominated flavor, with a decent malt backbone to support the hops, very nice. Leaves a nice hop aftertaste, not too bitter though.   To The Bottom!
POSITIVE	Thanks to XicanoBeerRun for bringing this bad boy to Tejas.  A smoked marzen, perhaps the standard-bearer for the style. It pours a rich, dark brown color with a wonderfully smokey aroma. A big bouquet of smokey goodness that surprises on the palate. Its not as bold tasting as one might expect, rather the smokiness comes across as mellow and well-balanced. It doesnt drop out nor does it overpower, rather the notes are there and remain present as it warms much like a mild-tasting Scotch. The carbonation holds up and its effervescence helps the smoke come across. Im a big fan of smoked beers so count me as a fan of this one.
POSITIVE	Bottled 4/25/11  Pours a copper color with some orange highlights. 1 finger of white bubbles. Looks really nice. I smell hops- pine and grapefruit along with some alcohol. Intially I taste the nice Amarillo hops- nice amount of pine and grapefruit. Then I taste some sweetness from the malts and a little spiciness from the rye. A slight amount of alcohol in the flavor profile. The mouthfeel is light to medium with some light carbonation. Overall this is a very nice easy drinking beer.
NEGATIVE	Label lists ABV at 6.5%  A: Pours a murky golden with a huge Duvel-like head. Lots of sustain and lacing.  S: Lots of nice citrusy hops aromas with a subtle not-so-nice solventy Pine-Sol aroma. Overall, decent.  T: A strong grapefruit taste, as if juice were added. Over-the-top hop flavor with plenty of bitterness to boot.  M: Medium-bodied with a fairly aggressive carbonation. Super dry and leaves the mouth feeling parched.  D: Subtlety is not what this beer is about when it comes to hops. It's not bad, but to my palate, some more balance would benefit this beer greatly.
POSITIVE	I'm impressed by what a flavorful, everyday pale ale this is. In a less enlightened age this could pass for an IPA. Pours a deep gold with a decent head and some lace. Crisp, well defined flavors marked by toasted grain and floral hops blend for a pleasing taste. Medium bodied with plenty of malt backbone to stand up to the sharp bitterness. As it warms the caramel becomes more apparent, but never overwhelms. A top notch session Pale Ale.
POSITIVE	On tap at the Clockwork Brewing Company: cloudy chestnut coloured beer with a decent head. A slightly chalky, yeasty lemon nose. The initial taste was a sweet dairy concoction, followed by lemon and then rather biscuity with a little hoppy bite. Slightly herbal, metallic flavour on the tongue to finish. Good stuff.
POSITIVE	Vintage: 2009  Serving Type: 12 oz. bottle poured into a Tulip glass.  A: Very rich in color all around. Silky black with 2 fingers worth of coffee colored head that holds strong. Lacing is tight and sticky.   S: Smooth roasted coffee aroma, which adds a nice bitterness to this brew. A sweet, bready oatmeal aroma that is sure to finish this stout perfectly.  T: Deep coffee/espresso roasted malts. Hints of chocolate bitterness. All the flavors are rich & full. Smooth sweet oatmeal finish on the palate.  M: Full body brew that coats the back of my throat and soothes the slightly soar throat. HAHA! Very velvety and smooth. Slight carbonation.  O: Love this! I would love to get more of this if it wasnt so darn hard to get a hold of more than 1 when it comes out. Well, I guess I will have to wait around 4-5 months for this great stout again!
POSITIVE	A. Poured black cherry brown from a growler into a pint glass. Small creamy bubbles slowly formed into a 2 and a half finger light brown head.Good lacing on the glass.  S. The first smell to hit your nose is coffee, followed by bitter sweet chocolate, rich malt and roasted barley. It has an earthy aroma.  T. Coffee, caskwood, barley, maple and nutty flavors. Lasting bitterness.  M. medium bodied, carbonation was decent, a little dry, a tannin like wine. Taste better with the head still there, as it adds to the creaminess.  D. I liked the bitterness, as well as the color and smell, although I think the taste lacks a little.
POSITIVE	Live review. Poured into my Samuel Smith clean, clear pint glass. $2.84 as a single at Heinen's near Cleveland.  A Light pink body, kind of basic with a minimal and short lived very light pink head. Slight lacing. Nothing special.  S Nice gentle and sweet cherry nose with possibly an authentic tartness. Interesting and different.  T Very nice...this is the nice tart cherry taste that you get sometimes in a good cherry pie...I always appreciate when a beer (or any drink really) accurately reflects the taste of the fruit that is included. This beer delivers on an accurate (and delicious) cherry taste in a nice ale.  M Fair. There is a hint of a smoothness.  D Very good, and judging from the ABV this is a dangerous beer. I cannot taste the alcohol very much at all and I could see that it would sneak up on you and you might be three sheets to the wind.  Notes: Another good beer from Founders which I am beginning to doubt has ever made anything but a bad beer.
NEGATIVE	Served in a standard pint glass. Bottled on 3/20/09 indicated on the bottle. Poured a hazy strawberry color with a loose quarter inch, off-white head that immediately dispersed into a skim and some clusters of ringlets around the edges of the glass. Some spots of lacing, but fairly weak legs. Mild nose - slightly tart cherries and a wheat character towards the back. Taste consistent with nose - sweet up front and tart towards the back, as well as some artificial sweetener in the mix; wheat character come out much less in the flavor profile. Mouthfeel was light/medium with a consistent background effervescence, some astringency in the mix and a fairly dry finish. Interesting beer, but one was sufficient.
POSITIVE	poured from 2011 bottle into snifter.  pours a gorgeous black with thick fluffy brown head. after a few minutes it settled down leaving no square cm of glass without lacing.  chocolate, roasted malts and maybe even some cherry hit the nose. the high bitterness balances out the sweetness exceptionally. the alcohol is there but blends nicely. it never slaps you in the face like many high abv brews.  nice and creamy with a thick body. in my opinion, simply perfect.  easily my favorite Founders Stout.
NEGATIVE	Presentation: Standard 12 ounce bottle sealed with a black crown cap which has Stoudts text on it, it actually says Stoudts World Class Craft Brewedhmm after the Double IPA I guess that is an opinion rather than a statement of fact LOL. The main label has a very patriotic feel to it, yet on closer inspection the draped Old Glory has 13 stripes, though the quantity of red and white stripes is inversed, and the dark blue patch has no stars.guess its either a modern interpretation, or it could just be that the Stars and Stripes are altered enough to allow it to be used on a Bottle Label. Described as an American Style Pale Ale and a microbrewed beer. No strength but a Best Before 11/21/05 date is ink jet stenciled onto the top of the bottle neck.   Appearance: Lucid Amber orange body with a healthy looking off-white expanded head. Resilient lacing of the smattered kind that splashes and stays and never goes anywhere. Low level conditioning.   Nose: Hmmm, dare I say the best part about the whole experience was the nose. Nice low level pine oil aroma, tingle of malts and some cut grass in the background. Drops out with a light sweaty nose at the end which spoils things a little.  Taste: Fresh hop bitterness. Nothing stands out but all the trademark components are there in good measure. Citric hops, floral smears and some lightly toasted biscuit malts. Bitterness is enough to ride the strip start to finish. Short finish helps to assist you with picking this one again quickly.   Mouthfeel: Medium light feel, clean defined support from the carbonation assists the times when this one has balloon lightness. Dry at times though it seems to fade quickly.  Drinkability: Nice enough, it has some redeeming features that lend a nice touch to this American Pale Ale. Drinks well alone.   Overall: Like the Stoudts Pils, it cost me $1.69 for the pleasure of the single. There are simply way too many good West Coast Pale Ales in my locale to afford me the luxury to pick this one up again, but I am glad that I did nonetheless. A nice out of town APA. Decent enough.
POSITIVE	Another review input from notes. Notes came from both bottle and growler.  Poured into oversized snifter. Deep black body, opaque and viscous. Two and a half finger mocha colored head is set atop. The head sticks around, retention is impressive. Decent lacing left clinging to the glass as the head recedes.  The aroma leans towards the sweet side. Chocolate, molasses and a bit of a sweet earthy maple. There is a fair amount of coffee upset that helps balance out the sweeter scents. The bourbon emerges from beneath. Well integrated, bourbon comes through with caramel and vanilla flavors with only a soft booziness.  The flavor matches the aroma nearly stride for stride. Sweet flavors flood the palate up front, the maple being a bit more dominant that in the nose. Brown sugar and caramel flavors show up just behind. A dark chocolate and java flavor hold their own against the flavors up front. Vanilla and bourbon flavors integrated through out. The pour from the growler seemed a bit hotter than the bottle, but still showing an appropriate amount of restraint.  Full bodied Imperial Stout, carbonation comes in at a low to moderate level. The texture is rich and creamy and the finish long.  CBS is a very good beer, deserving of many of the accolades it has received. This is a big beer but manages to remain rather drinkable. The heat and booziness never become too abrasive. With everything that is right about this beer, it is a bit too sweet for my liking. Despite my personal opinion this is a beer you should try if you are ever presented the opportunity.
POSITIVE	Poured from a 12oz bottle:  To start, this is probably the best stout that I have ever had and certainly since being on BA.  A: Poured an opaque, black body with an thick dark tan head that took its time dissipating, ultimately leaving a nice ring once gone.  S: Reminded me of when I used to walk into my favorite coffee shop in Philly. The coffee aroma was practically spilling out of the glass. The aroma was dominated by the coffee, but followed with a hint of sweet chocolate.  T: Like I stated above, probably the best stout that I have ever had. Again, the coffee dominated the beer, but balanced really well with a very light hint of the chocolate and subtle malt flavors.   M/D: I was prepared for an overly thick beer, but was really surprised when it was not as thick as expected. Don't get me wrong it is thick but very easy to drink, smooth and the alcohol was not noticeable at all. I am not so sure that I would won't to drink more than one at a setting, but I would give it a shot. Top Notch beer I would recommend to anyone.
POSITIVE	Pours a deep dark brown with a hint of lacing - no head to speak of.  Oak is very prominent in the nose - has the typical earthy oak aroma. Also hints of boozy sweet caramel and a touch of vanilla.  Wow. Lots of bourbon. Tastes a lot like you'd expect from the smell. Very smooth & malty with some oak notes and a lot of boozy caramel sweetness. Not much fruit or vanilla flavor.  Mouthfeel is perfect - medium body, plenty thick, nicely carbonated.   I had no problem polishing off a bottle - at this abv it's probably best to leave it at one 'though.
POSITIVE	On tap at Founders in Grand Rapids. Jackpot!  A: Dark as a moonless night with a thick aggressive dark brown head.   S: The smell is enough to knock your socks off. Campfire, maple, vanilla, bourbon, chocolate, coffee, and...well you get the hint. I was so intrigued by the smell of this stout.  T: About enough taste to make you want to fall off your seat. A lot like it smells. At first the vanilla seemed to dominate over the rest of the flavors but it finishes real smokey like its kid brother (regular Imperial Stout.) Founders really knows how to make a stout.  M: Silky smooth delicacy in my mouth. Like a dessert.  D: The taste alone makes me drink this with no problem at all. Founders hides the 10% quite well. Again, very smooth.  Overall, probably my favorite on the Founders trip and that's saying something considering I also had CBS and KBS! God bless Founders and their stouts!
NEGATIVE	Appearance: Pours a pitch black color with a huge head - too much, in fact, though the retention is good; not much lacing, surprisingly  Smell: Dark chocolate, rather sweet, with a hint of coffee  Taste: Sweet, dark chocolate, up front; the same in the middle and in the finish; obviously, not much complexity  Mouthfeel: A real problem here, as the medium body is overwhelmed by fizzy carbonation, that prickles the tastebuds  Drinkability: The mouthfeel mars what would otherwise be a decent, though not complex, stout
POSITIVE	A - Poured an orange with a white head that goes away quickly  S - Sweet malt and grains, not very powerful  T - Lots of sweet malt and some wheat flavor, with a little bitterness due to the hops  M - Medium bodied, sweet, and slightly bitter  D - I would have another one of these, it was a pleasant experience
POSITIVE	This is the only mexican microbrew pilsener and i tough it was worth,perhaps the mouthfeel its too hoppy for a pilsener.This beer its from my hometown , Mexicali a very nice brewpub just on the main street (Justo Sierra and Panam st.) and theres always a lot of americans inside on weekends, which make think they dont sell it in the States CHEERS
NEGATIVE	Gave this one an aggressive pour into a goblet and almost overflowed. Nice one and a half inch head the color is light tan while the beer is a dark brown, almost black.  Smells musty, like freshly overturned sod with hints of chocolate malt.  Tastes metallic, roasted chocolate and burnt coffee. Just a hint of hops in the finish.  This one is thin in the mouth, but has good lacing. It's hanging on the sides for dear life.  The drinkability is good due to the thin mouthfeel. Overall I have had better bottles of this brew. This one tastes a little off compared to previous bottles. Generally speaking this is a decent Porter and worth buying.
POSITIVE	Served from a pitcher into an imperial pint glass on 11/9/11 at McMenamins Imbrie Hall in Hillsboro, OR.  Dark, with a short lived head an little to no lace. Roasted malt aroma, coffee and chocolate, but not overwhelmingly strong. Very noticeable licorice flavor characteristics with bittersweet chocolate as a secondary flavor element. Big body and rich mouthfeel. Improves as it warms to near room temperature. There is a fair amount of sweetness and a mild bitter finish. Very similar in taste and feel to a low ABV imperial stout.
POSITIVE	Thanks again to Kroggdawg for sharing this one. This is a complex barleywine that's a bit undone by a rough alcohol feel. For the most part this beer is very well balanced. The malt is candy-like, big and fruity, quite similar to Sierra Nevada Bigfoot and finished with grassy and citrus rind hops. I'd say "Bawdy" is an accurate name for this one.
NEGATIVE	got this one in the form of a 500mL can.  A: Poured into a tall glass, had a nice golden color and a fluffy, but rapidly vanishing head. the head and slick completely disapears after about 2-3 minutes, leaving just a golden drink that looks like cultured apple juice with a few bubbles in it.  S: it was alright, nothing bad about it, just nothing great. a bit hopsy and sweet smell.  T: it tasted sweet for me, though it was a smooth flavor with hops on the undertone. kind of tasted like clover to me. pretty sweet overal.  M: like the short lasting head, the mouthfeel was pretty thin, though smooth.  D: i'd get it again upon request, didn't mind this one at all, but i'd likely leave it in the can so i don't need to look at it.
NEGATIVE	Some people like this style some people hate it. I think I fall into the former catagory. On tap at the Toad, whcih was a pleasent surprise. Poured a hazy muddy brown color with a little bit of a grey head. Smelled of nothing but smoke. The kind of smoke that clings to your clothes after sitting around a campfire for a couple nights. Deep woody flavors and a bit of smoked salmos as well. Taste had more of that huge herby smokiness, but the finish was almost cracker like in its toastiness. very interesting blend of tastes. I would say that you should definitely try this beer even if you don't like smoked anything. it will be worth it.
NEGATIVE	Arrogant Bastard's little sister? Something in the flavor profile reminds me a little bit of the bastard. Pretty good malt flavor with sharp, bitter twang on the palate. Mostly sweeter malts in the aroma. Bitterness is just right for me. Paired this with some spicy soup and it held its own. Probably mild for the style; a good means of introducing someone to the style. I wont go out of my way for this brew but it's pretty good for what it is.
POSITIVE	On tap at Vintage, this big beer pours near black with some deep brown highlights. The dark mocha head holds very well and leaves a nice lace on the walls of the glass.  The aroma consists of cocoa and some lighter coffee. Very roasty as well. Deep and earthy. Very appetizing.   Heavily roasted malt flavor hits you initially and lingers throughout. Sweet with lots of dark cocoa. A syrupy sweetness arises with espresso as well. A strong bread/grain backbone ties everything together nicely. A well pronounced bitterness in the finish rounds out this extremely flavorful and complex beer.  The mouthfeel is very thick and decadent with a heavy syrupiness and low carbonation. Formidable and satisfying on the palate. Certainly a must try, and one of my favorite selections from one of my favorite styles.
NEGATIVE	Pours a deep copper color with tons of sediment resting motionless throughout. I've rarely felt a well built beer looked ugly, but the still sediment in this murky beer makes it look like swamp water. A strong citrus hop aroma, very strong. A strong, but enjoyable citrus hop taste too. I like a strong DIPA, and this one leads the way in hops it seems. The overwhelming hops does hurt the balance, obviously. Once again, this is a dense beer, so it rests heavy in your mouth. A strong, dry hop aftertaste makes this one tough on the drinkability. Normally a big Hoppin' Frog fan, but this one let me down compared to many others I have put it up against.
POSITIVE	I had this beer on tap at Duckworths in Charlotte...  A: The beer pours a pitch black color with a dark brown colored head and a good bit of lacing on the glass...  S: The smell is not as robust as it first seemed. Some coffee, some chocolate, and a hint of hopping...  T: Actually quite a nice taste. Its got an earthy coffee taste, just imagine some slightly burnt coffee, with a hint of baker's chocolate and a bunch of hopping at the back, which makes this stand out and not be too sweet or overbearing...  M: Smooth, could use a little thicker body...  D: I think this is a lot like Marshal Zhukov's, but without the tobacco and thick body. Its not the best IM stout, but its definitely one of the better ones.
NEGATIVE	Picked up an O'Fallon sampler while in St. Louis.  Loud, fizzing tan head that exhausts itself and dissappears. Murky, translucent brown color. This beer looks flat and ugly. Sorry fella.  Smells good. Chocolate covered cherry candies and hints of blended whiskey. Good stuff.   Tastes like diet cherry cola with an ensuing butt-tastic Anbesol/anteseptic aftertaste. Mouthfeel is thin and snappy. Ick.
POSITIVE	On tap at the brewery.  Tapped a pale hazed light gold with a moderate frothy white cap...good retention and lacing  Aromas are excellent: There's a very pungent delivery of the standard Hefe aromas like fruits, Banana, bubblegum, some sharp spicey citrus and the bonus...a rich decadent vanilla tone that seems to have affinity with the other aromas.  Tastes much like Schneider weiss with ample dry maltiness balanced by fruit tastes and some light sweetness then this decadent vanilla changes lots of the tastes into more complex impressions left mid palate...the finish gets very crisp and dry with cascade hopping and the wheat drying things up....damn this is a good wheat ale!
NEGATIVE	pours a clear amber-orange with a medium light beige head, and some lacing.  smell is of cour malt, some spice, earth, some floral, and a touch of caramel.  taste is of soda water, perfume, caramel, and malt, ends slightly dry and slightly bitter.  overall tastes better than it looks.
NEGATIVE	The beer was chilled and served in a pint glass.  Appearance: The body of the beer is ruby colored. The head was pale white with very little retention. No lacing marks my glass.   Smell: The aroma of the beer is mulled apple cider with nice spicy nutmeg, cinnamon, cardamon, ginger, brown sugar, and molasses.   Taste: Very sweet spicy apple pie hits my palate. The spiced flavor is as I expected from the aroma. The spices give a bit of bitterness to balance the brews sweetness. No alcohol is present in the flavor.   Mouthfeel / Drinkability: The body is medium. The carbonation is low and at times seems flat. The beer isnt a drain pour but not sure I would repeat this beer again. Given the choice between this beer or Anchor Steam Christmas I am rolling with Anchor Steam.
NEGATIVE	Beer poured a thick syrupy black into a stange glass. Like a cloudy moonless night on a desert island in the deep pacific. Moderate to no head, what little head exists looks like a chocolate milkshake, makes me giddy. Lacing is there but not prominent, still clings to the glass.  Smells very alcoholic, not much to mask the abv. Chocolatey and rummy. My first thought was definitely towards the rum due to the high alcohol content, but some coffee and flowery scents subtly prevail.  Tastes biscuity and, yes, dark as deep space. Alcohol taste is actually well masked compared to in the scent. Lots of chocolate and coffee. I could go for a more hoppy taste, alas.  Thick as a milkshake, if not more so. Full-bodied and bitter in the aftertaste. Seriously like dark chocolate anise-laced, bitter cake. A dessert-y beer.  As said above, a dessert beer. I wouldn't drink more than two at a time unless i was really enjoying myself. The strength of character makes one plenty enjoyable.
POSITIVE	Stout's Smooth Hoperator is an occasionally brewed "doppelbock" hopped like an IPA. It is more IPA then Bock/Lager, and there is really no way around that at 50IBU. Sure it is a lager and yes it is a high strength dopplebock at its core but the experiment of making it "American", which apparently means hopping it beyond recognition means you cannot think about this as a dopplebock.   The clean lagering, the ever so slightly sweetness of double bock - mostly because of the hopping I believe, the use of summit for bittering and a heavy handed use of Amarillo aroma with makes this a little difficult to puzzle out. In fact, when I sampled it at Stout's pub, I asked the server if she brought me the right beer as it was certainly leaning toward IPA territory and because of the hop excellent treatment tasting like an IIPA. The Amarillo aroma bleeds off of the rich, taupe color head. The a snap off dry finish of base the lager serves to highlight and brighten the hops. Simply stated this beer can only be considered awesome for the hop inclined. They really pulled off what I fully expected to be insipid.  I applaud this effort! I am pleased I went in open minded as you cannot approach this as a dopplebock, because that is just a bad tag that had a genesis in the core beer and provided license to create a label with a flipped out goat on it. If you go in understanding it as a hoppy experience and not expecting something in the bock family, I expect you will be impressed with this experiment and maybe slightly disappointed that it is randomly brewed twice a year.  For completeness, it is just as good out of the bottle. Prost!
POSITIVE	Cashew Mountain Brown is a dark mahogany color. Definitely looks hazy. A little light reveals some nice highlights that are somewhere between burgundy and crimson. A light tan head caps it off and stands about a finger tall. It recedes quickly and leaves light lace behind.  The nose is excellent. The brown malt base smells a little sweet and features just a touch of cocoa-esque chocolate. Smells like there's a little roasted malt too. Bourbon is easily noted, but seems polite and restrained. It works well with the malt base and doesn't overpower it. It does have a praline scent that's secondary. They all work extremely well together to produce a really nice smelling beer. Alcohol is there, but that's not surprising. Doesn't offend me.  The flavor is really impressive. There's no doubt about the brown malt base. It's a little sweet and extremely flavorful. Light cocoa and roasted malts are secondary. The barrel aging imparted a really nice, moderate bourbon flavor that is a great complement to the brown malt flavor. Oak and vanilla flavors follow and really broaden the flavor profile. There is a secondary nutty, praline flavor that's nice. I wouldn't mind if it were a little more pronounced. Nonetheless, it fits nicely and does add a positive flavor to the mix. Alcohol is there, but isn't overbearing or hot. Hey, it's barrel-aged. What do you expect? Finishes with a mix of sweet brown malt, bourbon, and vanilla.  The body is medium. It features very light carbonation and feels extremely smooth and creamy. With just a little more heft, the feel would be perfect. Damn good as it is. This stuff goes down far too easily. I'm having a 12 ounce glass, but would not object to more.  Founders Brewing Company produces mostly top notch barrel-aged beers. Cashew Mountain Brown is a fine example and an excellent addition to their roster. I believe this is my first experience with a barrel-aged Brown Ale (that I recall). It's a grand idea! There aren't any material shortcomings to discuss here. This is a stellar beer! Founders, please bottle this!
NEGATIVE	Got this as a gift from beertunes, Poured into a SA perfect pint glass, it was dark brown with a light brown head and decent lacing. Smell was sweet malt with some fruit in the background. Taste was nice, im not a huge fan of the style but this was quite good. Had what i would call a cough syrupy mouthfeel but with a tangy hop finish. Recommended if you can find it. Thanks T!
POSITIVE	Been on quite a Founders kick lately, with both Breakfast and Impy Stouts being huge hits. Red's Rye seems to be the next best available, so I was ready to give it a shot!  A: Medium amber color with a significant head that displays good retention and lacing.  S: Piney and slightly sour (due to the rye), with some underlying peach aromas.  T: Opens with an immediate bitter, sour rye and grapefruit pith aspect, with the peach slightly peaking through underneath. The aftertaste was a decent but the bitter/ sourness got a bit too much of the upper hand.  M: Medium bodied, a touch thick, and fair carbonation  D: Another really solid offering from Founders. May not be my favorite sytle but this is pretty impressive. Probably more of a Red than a Rye (I think it's closest comparable is Red Rocket by Bear Repub), but it does a good job of stretching the style (into IPA territory) while still staying true. Not quite up to par with their Stouts, but worth a shot if you're looking for something original.
POSITIVE	From a slender 500 ml. capped brown bottle with no freshness date.  Poured a dark porter-like brown with a foamy off-white head that settled into a thin lacing, minimal amount of sticking.  Aromas of roasted malts, caramelized sugar, floral hops and a light smokiness, a sweet smoky nose overall.  Medium, steady carbonation and a malty crisp, dry, smooth medium bodied mouthfeel.  Pleasant lightly smoky taste, roasted lager malts mingled with caramelized sugar, a subtle toasted graininess, a light fruitiness, the hops are pretty subdued, and a dry light smoky, grainy and sweet caramel finish. The alcohol is well masked, only a brief flash towards the end.  I admit, I like the beers from Okocim, I found this one to very drinkable, well worth trying.
POSITIVE	Holy best dopplebock I've ever had batman.  A- A fingers width bone head sits atop a beautifully ruby tinted amber colored Sam Adams sensory glass full of what looks like pure bliss.  S- Hops explosion grapefruit and lemon peel with a little sweet smell coming through.  T- Ruby red grapefruit roasted malts and cherries, so hard to label this a dopplebock.  M- Medium bodied, light on the carbonation and lingers a bit but it is nice when this flavor lingers.  D- I love this beer, I could drink more than a few.  PROST!!!
NEGATIVE	On-tap at Pacific Coast  A: The pour is nearly black, maybe just a really dark brown color with a small tan head.  S: Lots of things going on here. I get licorice, molasses, prunes (and other dark fruits), just to begin with. Also lots of roasted character and maybe a little bit of ash/burnt sugar. The nose is pretty sweet overall, though.  T: The flavor is somewhat harsh at times, but compared to the other beers these guys make, this is a winner. A bitter roasted malt flavor, prunes, molasses, licorice, and certainly some alcohol.  M: The body is medium with a low to moderate level of carbonation.  D: Not really my favorite take on an imperial stout, but it's a lot better than the other stuff they brew.
POSITIVE	On tap 7/18 @ old chicago in okemos 16oz mug, deep orange amber shade, white head fades  smells of delicious hoppiness, malts blended excellently, smells great  taste is a good bitterness, hop flavor is fantastic, malts play right behind giving a good follow through, piney, citrus, delicious  mouthfeel is crisp and bitter, easy to drink, great flavor, an excellent ipa - one of my favorites.
POSITIVE	Poured from a 12 oz. bottle, no freshness dating I can find.  A - Light golden, perfectly clear, orange hues. White bubbles form a nice little head that clears halfway through, leaving a ring of white on the edge. Nice lacing.  S - nutty, honey, alcohol. Has a little bit of that noble hop twang. Grains.  T - toasted nuts, bread, grains. Some malty sweetness balanced out by floral hop flavor and bitterness, but on the malty side. Some phenolics and a little alcohol warmth.  M - thin to medium thin bodied. Actually a little watery for the size of this beer. Carbonation is moderate. Sweet finish.  D - very tasty beer, perfect for enjoying on the porch with a warm spring sun and cool breeze. Alcohol is slightly above average but not going to sit you down. Another fine offering from Stoudt's.
NEGATIVE	From a tall 500 ml brown bottle. Pours out a clear pale gold with a tall tight foamy white head with impressive retention.  Light spicy grassy hops on the nose with faint grains in the background.  The flavour starts out clean, grainy malt finishing with light spicy hops, though not as clean in the aftertaste.   Mouthfeel is light, however the brisk carbonation makes up for that, providing a crisp texture throughout.  It may be an issue from transport that this Pils loses its lustre around the finish rather than remaining clean the whole way. Other than that its worth checking out.
NEGATIVE	i've been waiting to try this one for awhile now. i just can't hide it...  there's no head to speak of; i can't imagine why. the color is a nice garnet: deep caramelized ruby  there are some hop aromas, surprisingly. warrior, amarillo, centennial i think. there's a boatload of caramel, butterscotchy sweetness  huge hop flavor, but the beer behind it will not be upstaged. so much going onthis could very much be a barleywine. nice beer, actually (why "actually"? because it's a goddam monster and sometimes those are just too much) and the 13% is well hidden
NEGATIVE	Into my pint glass an orange-resin color, weak off-white head that rapidly dissapates. Lacing weak.  Aroma a sweet malty eclectic mix of ripe bananas and peach.  Taste a stark blast of spicey hops and sweet malt. Initial bitter hops balanced well with the sweet citrus malt. Taste is surprisingly rich and heavy -- lingering well.  Mouthfeel: thick and heavy - has to be in order to carry the powerful sweet and bitter balanced taste.  Drinkibility: the heavy nature of this beer may be an impediment. I'm not sure how many I can have without a break. Again, this is a filling rich beer. I generally like lighter IPAs that are bit toned down on the malts; that's not this beer. I agree this seems to me to be closer to a hopped-barleywine. But all and all, this is a fine brew.
NEGATIVE	A: Rich, deep black... a great tan head that sticks to the sides. Nice retention.   S: The barrel woods come through on the nose... malts and roasted aromas.   T: Rather similar to smell... the oaky taste, roasted grains. A little more chocolatey as it warms. Not a really 'big' flavour, but rich and quite delicious.   M: A little light bodied, just a little coating... could be a little heavier.   D: A fairly easy drink. Like the feel, it could stand to be a little heavier. I'd like to savour a little more flavour.
POSITIVE	Cloudy to look at...malty aroma...great on the palateand this is coming from a devoted Stone Ruination IPA drinker. This beer surprises with its unique flavors, very reminiscent of a Sam Adams Double Bock but with a clear hop note at the finish. This beer is sure to please the malt and hop drinker alike.
POSITIVE	Pours a hazy orange with sticky, aromatic head. The nose is powerful but balanced between the big, fresh hops that one would expect of this style but also a strong but overly sweet maltiness. The taste is remarkable. The hop/malt balance that was on the nose persists on the palate, with a fascinating interplay of citrus and resinous hops, each of them strong but neither overwhelming, with caramelly and other malts; not a bad amount of yeastiness, neither. Finishes long with an orange zest and notes of sweet and sour. Highly drinkable both alone and with a heap of grub.
POSITIVE	On cask locally  Pours with a deep copper body, shimmering hints of amber. Slight creamy off white head, some retention  Smell, whiff of englishy hops, some malt and a little smoke.  Taste, dry and fairly crisp, some lasting hop bitterness. Chewy caramel on the finish  Not a bad ale, drinkable and with a fair amount of depth and flavour
POSITIVE	My favorite memory of this beer was having one after biking 6 or so miles to pick it up and get home with it. It tasted like liquid gold at that point in time, but even water would have tasted like heaven-sent nectar.   A- Gorgeous lacing, and frothy cascading foam, sheets and rings of lace in the glass. Sexy.  S- Kona coffee grounds, roasted, not especially fresh.   T- Coffee, bittersweet chocolate, hint of smoke. Distilled flavors of a coffeehouse. At times metallic though, so not perfect.  M- Shines in this dept., exceptionally smooth, like many of Founder's bigger beers.  D-How many cups of coffee would you drink on average? Apply that figure to this beauty...
NEGATIVE	Clear amber to orange colored beer with a small white colored head.  Smell is strongly smoked with a equally strong medicine scent. Smells more like ham than bacon. Mildly sweet smelling with some vanilla in it.  Starts out sweet with a rather nice smoky flavor, something here tastes like apple. Sweetness tones down quite a bit after a few minutes. Bitterness kicks in after a while but this is a sweet smoke beer.  Mouthfeel is good.  Overall a very pleasant Rauchbier, not sure why this one is filed as a Doppelbock instead.
NEGATIVE	Made a trip to the brewery as a refreshing stop from a driving tour of Amish country and picked up a mixed 6-pack to get a feel for what Stoudt's can do.   Side-poured the beer into a pint glass. It has a nice orange-amber color with a small white bubbly head that faded away with each sip. The body of the beer is hazy and inviting.   The smell is rather fruity, malty and sweet, with a definite tinge of alcohol. Given the high ABV, the alcohol smell is very well-balanced.   The taste is initially tangy and fruity, leaving a malty aftertaste over the whole mouth as it is swallowed. Mouthfeel is nice, that leaves you with a pleasurable sting from the high alcohol content and carbonation. It became more drinkable as I went on, but not a beer I will return to in the near future.   Overall, a good, but not great double IPA.
POSITIVE	Hot damn! Served on tap at the brewery. Like a dream come true.  A: The stout is black with a tan head. Dark and absorbing. Great to look at.  S: The nose is heavy with coffee. Bourbon and lactose follow with a pronounced sweetness. But the coffee? Oh how wonderful.  T: Each sip is a treat. Coffee and chocolate are dominating, follwed by a mild sweet bourbon flavor. Lactose lends a milky smoothness. There is just far too much going on to truly appreciate how awesome the ale is. I liked the maple ale but this one takes the cake.  M: I rated the bottle version of this perfect on all aspects. The mouthfeel really lives up to that original rating. I'd let it sit on my palate for hours.  D: Just friggin' awesome. Thank you, Founders, for making this.
POSITIVE	Visual Appeal: dark, misty brown with a maroon tinge like sunlight in a dark wood Smell: wonderful smokiness, like an autumn breeze Flavour: noticeable malt presence, earthy Mouthfeel: well-carbonated, but not as strongly as I would like Drinkability: above average, not overpowering like so many yank brews but not underdone either  Sat on the patio with The Cantankerous for this one and watched the birds playing in the woods behind our house. The smell of the Aecht Schlenkerla was especially pleasing. Surprised by how much I liked this.
NEGATIVE	Had it from a bottle into a glass. Not a bad beer, poured darker than I would have thought, but style felt that I tastes fruity overtone, amongst all the except toasted malts.   Only very slight bitter aftertaste than ran away quickly.   Probably wouldn't go out of my way to drink it again, but if someone served it up, I wouldn't refuse it either.
POSITIVE	Clear orangish-red. Extremely fine, bright white head.  Biscuit and caramel dominate over leafy, bright, earthy hops. Nice fresh baked white yeasty bread lurks underneath. Really nice IPA nose. Reminds me of NBB's 2 Below, but on a more composed scale.  Medium in the mouth. Malt dominates initially, with biscuit in control, well-supported by some light caramelly notes. Hops kick in on the mid-palate, with a nice fresh flavor. Good bitterness on the long finish. Some mineral shows at the death adding complexity.  Lowish carbonation allows the malt to really have a run at the palate. There's enough there to scrape clean at the finish. Very drinkable. Nice to have a local, sessionable, hoppy beer like this one. Well done, O'Fallon!
POSITIVE	Medium amber filled with a cloud of fine particulates. The eggshell colored head has a quality look about it. It displays innumerable surface pits and translates a fair amount of stickiness into pebbled hunks and small sheets of lace.  I'd love to know what hops Naughty Nellie uses in her perfume. The major component of the nose is unlike anything that I've experienced before and I'm fairly certain that it's hop-related. There's a funky, earthy quality that is somewhat reminiscent of Belgian yeast... yet nothing like it. It isn't an altogether pleasant aroma, but isn't bad either. It's just different.   Nellie tastes like she smells. I can't decide if hops or yeast is the major contributor to the aroma and the flavor (I'm leaning toward yeast). The brewery mentions apricots in their tasting notes and I would have to agree. While it isn't what I'd call a lip smacking APA, it's beginning to grow on me as I get deeper into the bottle.  Sweet and bitter are present in roughly equal measure, with sweet fading away on the finish. The body/mouthfeel favors the lighter end of the style spectrum and is well suited to sessioning if the spunky amount of carbonation isn't a deal breaker. This may be the first beer that I've seen that actually calls itself a session beer right on the label.  The Naughty Nellie that Naughty Nellie's Ale was named after was a lady of the evening, harlot, tart... take your pick. Since variety is the spice of life, a maxim that I'm sure applies to her profession as much as it applies to beer, I'm willing to cut her ale some slack for its uniqueness. I won't be buying it again, but for a one night stand, she... er, it... was an enjoyable enough ride.
POSITIVE	A: The beer poured a clear amber color with a nice white/slightly off-white head that disappeared too quickly.   S: The beer gave off a nice aroma. A little sweet, hoppy and probably more malty and grainy than anything else, but the combination was really well done.  T: The taste is malt with some hops mixed in and some grains as well. Follows the nose well. I think that I might have gotten some carmel or toffee as well, but it was very secondary.  M/D: The carbonation may have been a little high, but it did not really detract from the beer. It was crisp, smooth, dry and left a nice aftertaste. The six-pack was gone quickly. This one will be a staple this fall season.
POSITIVE	Presentation - Poured into Flying Fish pint glass  Appearance - Pitch black, dark tan head with little retention, minimal lacing  Smell/Taste - Chocolate and coffee abounds here, I detect a bit of milkiness, little booziness for an 8% alcohol brew  Mouthfeel - Medium bodied, not as dry a finish as one would expect from a stout  Drinkability - Sessionable  Overall - A good beer
POSITIVE	Had this on tap at Moan and Dove. Beautiful rich and creamy appearance with a very dark, chocolate-colored head. I could sense thin wrapped aromas of cocoa and malts but it seem a little light for an imperial stout. The taste was excellent, creamy and explicit chocolate flavors. This was a heavy drink indeed but perhaps due to its frappe-like qualities it almost seemed airy in texture, like cream. Overall, this was delectable and delicious.
NEGATIVE	Poured into a Town Hall Brewery globe on August 12th 2011.   Pours a dark honey color with a solid 2 fingers of head that dissipates to nothing. Nice color but it need more body and lacing.  Smell is sweet and fruity. A little yeast and spice.  Taste is much of the same as the smell but not as wanted. I want more sweet and less belgian froth. Good beer though.  Mouthfeel is very light and rolls through out the pallet without a problem.  Overall a great beer with few flaws but huge flaws. I need more from the taste.
NEGATIVE	a: Medium copper in color, slightly hazey. Pour leaves a lovely , frothy white head that lasts and lasts.  s: Alcohol soaked figs or raisins and some brown sugar are the most noticeable, Some sour wheat and cherries appear as it warms.  t: Alcohol and cherries are the dominant flavors here. This is the most flavorful U.S. quad I've had but it's just too much. Some sweet sugary malts are here along with an alcohol burn at the end.  m: The carbonation comes pretty close the genuine Belgian article. It's certainly thick and silky enough for the style.  d: I don't know how old this bottle was but some age might have helped mellow this out. I won't be in a hurry to try this one again.
NEGATIVE	As advertised, this beer appears a smooth looking clear orangey golden color, not much head worth mentioning. Smell is pretty nondescript - a little pale malt and some butter. Taste is pretty bland as well. Barely any hop characteristics, a bit of sweet grains or nuts and the smallest amount of toffee. Not really anything jumping out at me here. Kind of a grimy mouthfeel combined with the lackluster taste makes for a pretty boring beer unfortunately.
NEGATIVE	Thanks goes to sweem for picking this up for me. Bottle split into tulips.   A: Cloudy apple cider brown gold. Small white head, fast fading, leaves a tiny lace ring.  S: Smells like October. Pumpkin, clove, cinnamon, nutmeg, all spice. Sweet malt back bone. Hint of booze.  T: Pretty much a mirror of the nose. Full on spice and pumpkin. Maybe a touch over the top on the spices. Sweet malt and a hint of booze.   M: Medium creamy body. Mild carbonation.  O: This one is a bit much for a bomber. I had trouble finishing a full glass. Glad I split it.
POSITIVE	"Bavarian-style sour mashed Weizenbier" Poured into a pint glass.  Pours a cloudy, light yellowish color with a small white head, dissipates quickly with moderate lacing. These was a very mild nose of wheat and yeast, almost non-existent. Up front flavors or lemon, wheat, and green apple with a smooth sour cherry and hoppy finish. Light, crisp and refreshing with mild carbonation.   The smell, or lack there of, initially turned me off, but the more I drank this beer, the more it grew on me, the sour mash added great depth.
NEGATIVE	Looks liek a normal helles. Golden, crisp looking yellow with one column of bubbles making its way to the top. But it doesn't smell like your normal helles. It's smoked. But smoked cyrstal and pale malts. Very lioght smokey aroma mixed with grass and pilsnert malts. Tastes like a distant smokehouse. Light mlating with an equally light smoke flavor. Very unique. One of a kind.
POSITIVE	2011 9% abv  A- i didnt know what to expect from this beer, definatley didnt see this to be a violet purple, poured to get a 1-2 inch head that laced my glass. it lingered for a minute or so and was gone  S- tart raspberries, some yeast not much more than the ras.  T-good lord. sweet tart. real raspberry flavors. kind of overwhelming imo. remindes me of the flintstones berry push up pop.  M- very sticky, kind of medium high carb, finishes rather dry like a champagne.  O- this is different, i have 4( well 3 ) bottles i shall be getting used to this style in time.
POSITIVE	Got one of these from Dave (d0b) - I'd never heard of it. Served in my trusty Surly pint glass.  A - Three fingers of pillowy off-white foam with solid retention and lots of patchy lacing. Transparent red-orange color with a slight haze and a few tiny bubbles rising to the top. Looks like an APA should!  S - Lots of grassy/earthy hoppiness, with a solid toffee and bready malt backdrop. I can tell this is definitely fresh - not all that different from the SNPA I had yesterday. Pretty solid stuff.  T - The beer is quite a bit more malt-forward than the smell - lots of nice toffee and bready notes, with only a tinge of floral hops. I think it needs a tiny bit more hoppiness to call itself an APA - this feels more English Pale.  M - There's a little bit more carbonation than I typically like - a little bit of burn on my hard palate. It's medium-bodied and otherwise pretty average.  D - I could definitely have a couple of these brews, but it's not hoppy enough to be a preferred session beer, especially for something called Hopdinger!
POSITIVE	Poured 500ml bottle into a pint glass. Pours a deep reddish brown color with some white foam and minimal lacing.   Smell - wow. Never smelled a beverage quite like this. Liquid smoke, beef jerky, bacon, you name it, its in there. Smells like your clothes after a night of sitting around a campfire. Made me worried for the taste, but...  Taste - smooth, creamy, none of the smokiness that the smell smacks you in the face with. Some fruits buried in there, other sweetness - maybe caramel, from hints of a nut brown style. A wonderful mixture that stays smooth and creamy throughout the taste.  Very drinkable - if the smell doesn't bother you, you can out down many of these. A unique style definietly worth trying.
NEGATIVE	The color is essentially red with a dark orange hue. A fluffy white head pours and remains at about one finger for a short time, leaving light to moderate lacing behind. The smell is malt, a light caramel sweetness, something just slightly musty, and a mix of tart and citric fruits. It's a little light with a funk to it. The taste is to par with the exception of a stronger hops presence and a light sourness lingering that seems to complement the sweetness and makes me think it's some mix of fruits that produces it. The body shifts between seeming a little thin and filling out with a creamy thickness. I don't know when that's happened before. I'd say the light side of medium is where this one sits. Carbonation is moderate. I think this loses points in some score because no one really knows how to classify it and it seems some people want more alcohol in the flavor. I think well-masked is a good thing, and I;ve certainly had worse than this. It's an above-average brew.
POSITIVE	A- black body with a thick looking coffee colored head. small head on a decently hard pour. very even and complete lacing left on the sides of my glass.  S- chocolate, bourbon, vanilla, wood, and some coffee. theres alot going on with this one.   T- slight astringency. some vanilla and oaky flavors. lots of bourbon chocolate and coffee  M- perfect. thick, creamy, and rich. warming of alcohol as it goes down  D- this one has earned the hype. id love to be able to have several of these in a sitting. i should consider myself lucky to have picked this one off the shelf today! check this one out if you get the chance.
POSITIVE	Bottle from New Beer. Washed out BB date on the neck reads 3/??/09. Purchased at the end of January.  Poured into my DFH rounded pint glass.  Two inches of caramelized milk-colored head over a clear & deep copper body.  Smell is stuffy with crackermeal, lightly bittergreen hops, caramel, stale pepper, & metal shavings.  Taste is sweet upfront with bready malt & grapefruit rind. Toasty malt fills the middle with some grape skins & some light brown sugar. Body is thin & sharp, but not overly carbonated. Finish is resiny with pine & dusty bread.  Aside from the less then clean finish, & the slightly off smell, I think this is a really good ESB. Just enough hop presence, & a good backing of malt, without adding unnecessary body.
POSITIVE	12oz bottle from the first shipment of Founders Double Trouble to the Cleveland area. Pours a clear, golden color, thin white head retained and thick Belgian lace. Plenty of floral accents, citrus, pine, grapefruit--delicious. Smooth, resinous hops from front to back, without cloying aftertaste. Alcohol well concealed. Taste does not disappoint. This brew is solid and a welcome addition to the pantheon of DIPAs.
POSITIVE	Pours black with a nice frothy tan head with great lacing. Just the faintest amount of light makes it through when held up to a light. Big roasted malt and coffee smell and just a hint of chocolate. Big coffee up front followed by sweet roasted malt and chocolate. If you were going to taste the hops its at the end and in the after taste. This beer goes down like butta, perfect carbonation makes for easy drinking. At a little bit over 8% this beers hides it well and i could definitely drink more than one. I so happy Founders is available near me now one less awesome beer I have to trade for. As usual, well done Founders.
NEGATIVE	The beer evacuates the 355ml bottle a clear gold with a generous creamy white head that upon eroding leaves a thin but covering sheet of lace. Nose is all malt, sweet with a citrus like crispness; start is lightly sweet, the malt profile adequate, and the top light in feel. Finish has a pleasing acidity, the hops quietly spicy, the aftertaste dry, a drinkable beer, but nothing to shout about.
POSITIVE	Pours out light copper brown with an orange hue, not much of a head. The nose offers some sweetness, honey, spice, herbascious hops, along with some alcohol. The taste is fruity and sweet, developing some alcohol, and finishing with a spicy bite. The mouthfeel is lightly carbonated, finishes long with the alcohol and spice lingering.
POSITIVE	A dry-hopped dark ale made with rye sounds good to me! Pours an inky dark brown with a voluptuous, creamy, glass-coating, light khaki head. Big roasted malt aroma with whiskey, smoke, peaty earth, and dark fruit. Spicy hops. Roasted malt flavors blend with chocolatey sweetness up front. Whiskeyish fruit comes around as the roasted turns to increasingly bitter and coffee hops. Yum! Faintly warming. Long dark chocolate bitter finish. Medium bodied with a surprisingly spritzy mouthfeel. Nice work!
POSITIVE	Some days, when it's only 7 outside, you need a stout of this fortitude, there's just no substitute.   Black oily pour into an Arcadia glass. Mocha tinged foam sticks around for a minute, then retreats to the edges. Served around 50-55, don't drink this straight from the fridge, it will mute some of the smell and taste.   Special aroma of dense fudgy chocolate, and woody vanilla traces from the barrel. A little bit of ashy char is there too, though not over the top. Flavors deliver on what the nose hints at, rich chocolate, minor coffee undertone, vanilla, oak, and trace heat from the 10%. Over time it really develops and builds, a long finish connects between each flavor-packed sip. Some light bitterness that is identical to unsweetened chocolate is there, and lingers in the finish.   Incredibly smooth (oats?), not heavy or syrupy, yet it's a sipper. Perfect to sit and contemplate without weighing you down. There's a reason it's ranked so high...it's a very balanced imperial stout, possibly the most balanced i've ever had.
POSITIVE	Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass.  Appearance- Nice orange/gold color with a nice amount of head with lacing thoughout drinking.  Smell- Amazing citrus hops smell, totally inviting me to enjoy the beer.  Taste- Citrus hops right out in front, with a solic malt backbone to hold the beer together. Very tasty.  Mouthfeel- Very bitter, but not overwhelming at all, exactly the mouthfeel that I would expect from this type of beer.  Drinkability- This beer is very dangerous! I would never have put this beer at 9.4. I have had some beers half as strong that do not go down as easily. Very drinkable, everytime I have one, I already want another. This may be the most underrated beer out there right now!
POSITIVE	From notes, 12 oz bottle into a pint glass  It pours that lovely black brown color with a faint fizzy caramel head. It smells predominantly of coffee with some chocolate and sweet malt aromas, but the nose isnt that powerful. The flavors are very complex, smokey chocolate, coffee, sweet malts with some charred wood flavors, quite intense for your standard porter. Its got a bold character and texture and goes down that way.  Verdict: All around an intense porter, rich and rewarding. If you are looking for a dark sexy beer, this is one to try for sure.
NEGATIVE	On tap at the brew-pub August 14, 2007, where the spec's were listed as follows:  ABV: 6.3%  IBU: 47 Original Gravity: 1.0147 Brewed on July 27, so it's obviously not just an autumn release.  Appearance is dark amber clear, the color of bourbon, under a smallish head that fades quickly.  Smell is sweet malty vanilla, with vinous sour cherry-blueberry wine aroma. Lots of sweet and sour fruitiness. Metallic rusty pine floral hops.  The taste is a bit of sweet malt at the front, followed quickly by a big rush of bittering hops. Bitter, metallic, unsubtle & bright. Long dry-bitter finish. A bit one-dimensional. However, that's the style, right?  Mouthfeel has a surpisingly rich fullness and thickness. Nice.  Drinkability is lower due to the one-dimensional aspect of the beer: ESB's are supposed to be more balanced than this.
NEGATIVE	12 oz bottle  Pours a deep reddish with an off white or light tan-ish color head that was fairly thick and foamy.  Nice balanced malt hop aroma. Not complex but still good.  Taste is good, but more malty than expected, not as well balanced as other ESB's but still has a good flavor.  Body is lighter than most good ESB's that I have had. The beer is smooth with a good malt aftertaste and pretty easy to drink. Overall a good beer but not the best representation of the style.
POSITIVE	12 oz. bottle with no freshness date. Brewed to 1.064 with pale, crystal, carapils, peated and Munich malt; hopped with magnum and goldings to 27 IBUs and fermented with English ale yeast. It pours almost ruby (more of an auburn), lightly-hazed, with medium carbonation and a thin cap. Rich and sweet in the nose from the Munich and crystal, blended with earthy, tea-like, nearly roasted notes. The flavor starts malty and rich, lightly sweet, followed by hops and an earthy fullness from the peat. Hints of raisiny crystals creep in here and there and are balanced by lightly spicy hops that contribute little bitterness. A flavorful yeast strain rounds it out and things end on a lightly peated note. While it begins crisp and dry, once the carbonation ebbs the body fills out nicely. Very nice brew here - a bit more hop flavor than most Scotch ales, but this is well-balanced and damn tasty. Definitely recommended.
NEGATIVE	Well, among light beers this is probably one of my preferred ones.   Pours golden yellow. Fizzy. Not much head. Weak aroma. Subtle caramel and mild hops. It's funny because it tastes a lot like O'Douls Amber. Thin, but nowhere as thin as something like Coors light. When there's no other choice, this is an acceptable beer.
NEGATIVE	The best tasting of This brewery's reincarnations of the old Elora Mill product line. sugary aroma. Watery mouthfeel which is DNA of this brewery. Looks and smells and even tastes like cola, with moderated carbonation.  Passable beverage, nothing that hits the style.
POSITIVE	A: Crystal clear medium-dark yellow color with an inch + head which kept a frothy presence throughout the session.  S: Whoa! I always notice a strong nose on wet-hopped beers and this one is definitely no exception. Very earthy, almost like sniffing on a freshly cut pine tree. Additionally, there is a lot of green hoppy bitterness, with citrus (grapefruit and orange specifically) as a backdrop.  T: One hoppy and bitter mother, but it's very well balanced. Sweet fruit and citrus throughout. For a hophead, this is heavenly!  M: Thick enough for the style, the AVB is draped in bitter, yet floral goodness, and the carbonation is aplenty!  D: I wish this were sold in 6ers, because at 6.5%, this is quasi-sessionable and deserves another couple of sleeves in the cardboard holster.
POSITIVE	A: Hazy yellow/orange, OK head, but really dies off quick. No lace.  S: malts, maybe an adjunct of corn (?), apples, citrus.  T: Surprised after not being really inmpressed with the lack of head retention, and adjunct nose. Some yeast, green apple, honey orange. Finishes with a slight bready sweetness.  M: Light, clean. Crisp.   D: I can drink this one after the other. Nothing heavy to get in the way of summertime refreshment. Not sure I would want this while in the mood for a more complex beer, but, hell, it's a TON better that BMC beers.
POSITIVE	a: This was a clear, ruby/mahogany color. It poured with a huge, craggy, sticky, off-white head.  s: Plenty of tannins from the barrel and whiskey in the nose. I also got some well done toffee.  t: Lots of whiskey and tannin tobacco here as well, more of the latter. There is a pleasant charred quality here that I guess is from the barrel. Sweet toffee and a hint of vanilla.  m: This has a good texture from gentle carbonation. The lingering, slightly boozy, oak is nice.  d: Stoudts does barrel aging right.
NEGATIVE	Pours an amber orange color with slight lacing around the top and mild to very little carbonation.  Smell is really underwhelming for a beer of this magnitude, I was really disappointed by the nose, way too delicate for a big beer with big %$#@&s! Smells of caramel, toffee, very heavy on the malt aroma, slight hint of grapefruit presence, smelled a little bisquity as well. I've read the other reviews for this beer and the citrus/pine domination just didn't settle in my nose like the others. Maybe I've been too bastardized by the love of hops?  Taste starts out with sweet caramel malt that hits up front and the middle of the tongue, tastes a little bisquite-like, is sticky sweet, and ends with a bittersweet grapefruit finish that evolves into a warm and boozy finish. Bitterness seems to take a back seat to the malts which I find unusual for an American IPA, especially a Triple.   Mouthfeel is sticky, thick, semi-smooth on the tongue, and the finish leaves a thick syrup-like finish in the mouth. Body is borderline heavy.  Drinkability is decent, but I would like to see more hop dominance for a triple IPA. Still, very well brewed and an enjoyable sipper. I do like this beer.
POSITIVE	Pours from the bottle like black velvet, building up an awesome dark brown head.  Chocolate, creamy roasted coffee upfront. As it approached room temp, the alcohol become more present, but never overpowering.  The taste up front was coffee, chocolate, and hints of oat, with a mild hoppy bitterness on the finish. A fine balance among the flavors.  The mouthfeel was smooth and velvety.  Overall this was a fine beer, that I look forward to drinking again. Most oatmeal stouts seem to have an inherent bitterness to them, but it was pleasantly less pronounced, and more balanced with the other flavors in this particular brew. Can't wait to try on tap somewhere.
NEGATIVE	This beer pours a dark brown with a light brown head. The head settles into a nice lacing. The beer has a nice roasted malted hops smell with a hint of coco. It has a nice blend to its taste not too over powering and it has a clean after taste. Its a smooth and creamy beer with a clean feel and a good finish. I would say there isnt much spectacular about this beer but it is a great tasting quality porter. Defiantly worth a try.
POSITIVE	First had: on tap at Teresa's, Wayne, PA  Six-ounce pour into a flute glass. A lush ruby-colored beer with a thick magenta head, that receded to a thin layer, leaving some nice lacing behind. Aroma thick with raspberries, like Lindeman's Framboise times five, at least. Juicy sweet taste, raspberries aplenty--you can almost feel the grit of the seeds between your teeth--tart sensations on the tongue, grassy, with subtle hints to the malt and yeast at play in the distant background. Medium-bodied and very drinkable for a fruit beer. Founders is definitely my go-to brewer if I'm in the rare mood for a raspberry or cherry (see: Cerise) beer.
NEGATIVE	Ok - This beer is pretty rough from the can or bottle, but when served on draught at a pub where its turned over a fair bit, its actually not too bad. It wipes the floor with the likes of tooheys new and carlton draught, which are absolutely horrible.   It has the normal elements of a boring macro - dry, headache inducing, slighlty harsh. But there is a pleasant flowery element in the finish, almost like a pilsner. Could be indicative of freshness.  Its fairly often Ill drink a pint of Swan Draught for $6 than pay $9 for an "imported" heineken or stella which are actually domestically brewed under license, but sold at imported prices   Although I'm reviewing the draught version, extra points for the brown bottle and nice design. Its a pity they dont set up a decent outlet/microbrewery in the classic old brewery building on the Swan River. Wishful thinking.
NEGATIVE	12oz bottle poured into a tulip.  A - Ruddy orange with a very short-lived head.  S - Toffee, nutmeg, cinnamon, a hint of ginger, and just a little squash-like aroma.  T - Biscuity and toffee malt, pumpkin pie spice, and subtle pumpkin flavor. Inoffensive, but not all that interesting.  M - Light-medium body, good carbonation, rather smooth.  D - A decent pumpkin beer, lacking in depth, but easy enough to drink. I certainly wouldn't turn it down if offered.
POSITIVE	Appearance: Dark amber with excellent clarity and a solid creamy off-white head. Appetizing.  Smell: Smoke, meat and wood with faint malty sweetness to balance the savory/earthy qualities. I can't help but think of bacon when I smell this, which is strangely appetizing.  Taste & mouthfeel: Very smoky up front, but not as dominant as the aroma suggests. Malt provides a good balance, though it's not overly sweet. A nice bold hop bitterness melds pleasantly with the smoke in the finish. The light body and crisp carbonation make this one surprisingly drinkable.
POSITIVE	Pours a clear dark brown with a very little head.  The nose is very strong roasted malt notes and a bit of chocolate, dark fruits and a bit of booze.  The taste is a big mix of caramel, dark fruits and roasted malts. The finish is slightly sweet and boozy.  The beer has a wonderfully rich mouth feel that's nice and smooth with some alcohol warmth on the end.  At 8.3% I can easily have a few of these and be stumbling. That being said this 8.3 big boy's drinkablitiy is pretty high considering the full bodied taste and ABV.  *Note: Tasting notes from 10/20/09. Have had this on bottle and draft and definitely prefer the draft.
NEGATIVE	Split with my dad. I know these made it to PA, but I sure didn't see any. Thanks to OHLRangers for the chance to try this unique offering. Dad gave it a B+.  a: This was a clear, moderately dark golden color. It poured with a short lived fizzy head.  s: Smells interesting, even if it is a bit overpowering. Plenty of sweet elements, the boozy bourbon, vanilla, lots of obvious maple syrup, and something that reminds me of the candied sugar in a tripel. The heat wafting off of this strong, but not obnoxious. Sweet and boozy pretty well sums this one up.  t: Sweet maple, bourbon, and booze up front. Sweeter than I normally like, but it does start off pretty well. These flavors carry over into the finish, which is pretty hot. There is a tingly, unpleasant medicinal quality at the end as well. All I can taste is the booze, the barrel, and the maple. Any wheatwine characteristics are all but lost. Sweet almost to the point of being cloying and too hot.  m: Medium bodied with gentle carbonation.  d: I was less enamored with CBS than most, but it was a good bit better than Nemesis. I like the idea and I respect innovation, but this is a bit of a mess overall. I don't get the idea that time would help any, I'd be afraid it would only get sweeter. Thanks for the chance Ed, I am glad I tried it. Dad liked it I'm happy to say.
POSITIVE	Poured from the 500mL can into a tall pilsner glass.  A: The beer is a lighish golden color with a big 3 finger foamy slightly offwhite head with ok retention, leaving some lacing on the glass. A little carbonation is evident within, and the beer is crystal clear.  S: Bready malts and grassy hops with a touch of citrus in the middle there, as well as a mildly spicy note. Overall very clean with a touch of hoppiness evident.  T: Nice malt character on the intro of bread or really light biscuit profile. A bit of citrus lurking around in there, and grassiness. Finishes with a light herbal character and a touch of balanced bitterness and bread.   F: Light and crisp, but with a medium body.  D: Good flavor and relatively low alcohol make this an obvious go to in the drinkability department.   Overall this is a great option for someone looking for a solid taste but also something pretty light and easy drinking. This is a classic, and for good reason.
POSITIVE	Bought a sixer of this at the HEB Broadway Central Market in San Antonio. Heard it was good so i figured I'd give it a shot...I'm glad I did.  A: Nice golden color, very clear. It had about a one finger head on it that actually stayed while I was drinking it. About what I expected from what I've seen/heard.  S: Smells very good...can smell a great malty scent that is much better than the macro smell I'm accustomed to.  T: The taste is good....nice malt right up front, with a little bit of biscuit in the middle, and finishes quite clean with a burst of bitterness. It's quite a bit more bitter than my usual fare but I like the way it balances.  M: Average, a tiny bit fuller feeling than other of the same style. I like the ample carbonation as well-not too heavy, not too light.  D: I love beers of this style, so I could drink a lot of these if I had the cash to buy it more often.  I'm glad I spent the money to get this one...from now on every time I'm in town around the market I'll pick some up...it was worth the money!
POSITIVE	Appearance: Pours a hazy straw color with a light, fluffy, white head that fades to a film leaving sheets of lace.  Smell: Primarily citric and resiny hops, with a touch of graininess.  Taste: Toasty malts and a bit of citrus in the center. The finish is resiny hops with a hint of spiciness.  Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied, moderate carbonation, oily with a coarse finish.  Drinkability: Very easy to drink. It has a nice bitterness, but doesn't overdo it.
POSITIVE	Poured from bottle into a Chimay goblet. Bottle was labeled from 9/06/11  Appearance- Absolute pitch black.Very thin dark tan head that rapidly goes away. GREAT lacing throughout the whole glass.  Smell- Coffee right away followed by chocolate. Peanut butter presents itself as the beer warms up.   Taste- Wow this beer is thick and delicious! Of course coffee and chocolate is dominant. I can't believe my taste buds, but I taste Reese's peanut butter cups. Fig in the back.   Mouthfeel- Unbelievable...Probably the best feeling I've ever got from a beer. About as thick as real maple syrup. Coats your whole mouth and throat.   Overall- Top 5 beers I've ever had...I can see why this beer is world-class. At $12 a four pack, its a steal.
POSITIVE	A superb collaboration between Louisville's Cumberland Brewing and BBC.  Nice ruby amber in color, with minimal foam and no lace on my pint glass at the BBC restaurant in St. Matthews (which I fully recommend for top-notch food).  Sweet floral scent, with a bitter hops twist in the taste. I also get a hint of fruit, which is a nice addition.   A solid beer, with hints from different styles, but one of the most drinkable brown ales I've had in some time. Definitely not typical of the style, this one was light enough for a Summertime lunch pint, but with plenty of flavor and certainly not as overmalty as some brown ales. Delicious!
NEGATIVE	Pours a bright golden yellow. Two or three inches of white foam head.  Smells ... strangely like sweet malt and yeast. I actually checked to see if I had purchased the okocim malt liquor by mistake. i had not.   Taste is, again, strangely sweet. A pungent, almost cereal-grain malt sweetness to it, and maybe just a hint of the earthy zest/crispy/sort-a lemony flavor I expect from a pilsener. Mouthfeel was strangely thick and ... gloppy ... rather than the effervescent mouthfeel of a pilsener.   All in all, a weak offering.
POSITIVE	12 oz. bottle poured into a pint glass.  Pours a reddish copper color with a nice two-finger head. This is much darker than I would expect from an IPA: it pours almost like an amber ale or a Sams Lager.  The nose is full of fresh hops, citrus, and pine. The taste is beautifully balanced, for I immediately taste both bitter hops, roasted malts, and sweet lemon candy. There is a long hoppy finish that is quite delightful. The mouthfeel is extraordinary: mildly carbonated, it is frothy and a bit creamy in the mouth. Admittedly, this isn't a mouthfeel I would expect from an IPA, but it was sheer pleasure in my mouth.  The Centennial IPA goes down pretty easy: it is smooth, well balanced, and very drinkable. Although a tad heavy at 7.2%, aside from the mouthfeel there is nothing that suggests this level of alcohol. Certainly recommended.
POSITIVE	Many thanks to busternuggz for hooking me up with this beer in our recent trade. 12oz bottle into a DFH off-centered pint glass.  This beer is brewed with three things I love...rye, hops, and *cough cough*, seeds from the hop plant's cousin. Excessively hazy body shows a deep caramel, iced-tea core with a burnt orange & apricot exterior. The head is slim and light tan in color, resting as a thick ring of tiny bubbles. Interesting nose that's sharp with rye bread and citrusy hops. Sugared orange candies and Circus Peanuts smell a bit too sweet, but hold back just enough to let in notes of amber malt. A bit of nuttiness and pepper in the background.  Sharp, spicy rye and toasted bread crust hit the tongue first, quickly followed by a bit of grapefruit zest, resin, and tropical fruits from the hops. Hemp Hop finishes a bit grainy, with minerals and white pepper lingering after each sip. Body is clean and crisp, with an uppity carbonation level that gives some much-needed life to the medium consistency. Smooth at times, too, with a Cream Ale-like mouthfeel. I enjoyed Hemp Hop a bit more than the numerical aspect of my review suggests. A unique, tasty, and refreshing beer...and one I'd gladly revisit.
POSITIVE	This is a fascinating brew. A still, bright amber with virtually no head and a bouquet full of vanilla, bourbon, and alcohol. Curmudgeon has a strong coconut and vanilla flavor that is balanced by a bourbon-alcohol sting and a peppery dryness on the back of the tongue.   The interplay of flavors is exceptional, and they come together to create an overall character that is slick, fruity, and very heavy-hitting. This is a beer to sip and a fine complement to a big Thanksgiving (or other holiday) dinner.   Highly recommended; this is one of the most complex Founders beers I've had--and that says a lot.
POSITIVE	First had: on tap at Cooperstown Brewing, Milford, NY   Delightfully malty. Definitely preferred this over the stout. Poured dark brown with a white head. Malty aroma with subtle chocolate. Tasted malty with some sweet, dark fruits in the background, and a bit of various sugars. Nice smooth mouthfeel, and definitely drinkable.
POSITIVE	12oz brown bottle with no freshness dating. Served in an imperial pint.  Pours an extremely dark brown with a large, creamy, tan head. The body is close to, but not completely opaque as I can see a little ruby tint when I hold it directly up to the light. Head retention is good and some sticky lace is left. The smell is a very pleasant combination of roasted malts and smoke. There is also a good deal of earthiness and a certain meatiness (like bacon or sausage) to the aroma. The flavor features the roasted, smoky malts with some chocolate notes thrown in for good measure. The finish is lingering and smoky. The hop character of this beer is light and comes through with a mostly herbal quality. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a smooth texture and some soft carbonation.   All things considered, this is a very drinkable brew. All of the ingredients blend well together to form a beer that is enjoyable to drink, but not spectacular. There is nothing off-putting about it and the smoked malts are done very well without overpowering the porter characteristics. There is a solid malt profile and enough hops to help with the balance. I would certainly have another, although I don't know if I would necessarily seek it out.
POSITIVE	Intro: 12 oz. bottle poured in a tulip glass and shared with a friend  Appearance: Medium head that recedes quickly to a thin white cap although some lacings stays on the sides, ample carbonation that sticks to the inside of the glass with an almost root beer type of coloring only slightly lighter, more like sarsaparilla.  Smell: Carmel and alcohol smell is the most prominent but there is a bourbon smell that gets stronger. In appearance it reminds me of Old Stock Cellar Reserve by North Coast.  Taste: There is a strong bourbon flavoring with toffee tones. I taste the alcohol but the barrel aging really comes through to make the alcohol blend well with the bourbon flavors.  Mouthfeel: Feel the carbonation on the tongue, lots of fizz in the mouth. There is a lingering aftertaste with a slightly dry stickiness. It is almost astringent; between the dryness and the bourbon and alcohol it pushes the mouthfeel low on the scale, even though I really enjoy the taste.  Overall: With every sip you taste the bourbon. I am a big fan of Old Stock Cellar Reserve and this beer reminds me of the other in many ways. It is balanced with an excellent taste that is as smooth as 25 year old bourbon. Considering the difference in price and overall availability I would visit this beer again, maybe not a staple but certainly a regularly.
NEGATIVE	Pours a hazy golden honey color, perhaps a shade or two darker than most hefes/american wheat ales. The head is white and dense which settles into a light cap. The aroma is very faint, especially for the style. There is a faint aroma of grains. The taste has a cereal sweetness with a light fruity flavor and a tea like bitter twang. The wheat malt brings about a smooth feel but none of the wheat flavors are present. There is no real yeast flavors as well which is very disappointing for something that is labeled as a hefeweizen. This is more of a pale ale that uses some wheat. The feel is light to moderate with tingly carbonation, starts off smooth and creamy but finishes a bit astringent. This beer doesn't taste bad but it doesn't fit either the hefeweizen style or the american wheat style. The astringent hoppy bitterness is out of character as well.
POSITIVE	Finding this beer is well worthwhile, the aroma is possibly the only let down with slight esthery qualities but the full mouthfeel and warming notes make it a much bigger beer than expected. The deep intense flavour develops beautifully to leave you wanting more
POSITIVE	I love this beer, the bourbon, vanilla flavors are awsome. So far, ive been nothing but impressed with what founders has to offer. I will buy whatever these guys have to offer. A bit boozy, but this is what i love from barrel aged beers. Can't wait until next years version of this, i'll age at least one until then maybe more.
NEGATIVE	750ml bottle thanks to G311.  Pours cloudy amber in color with a small off-white head that fades.  Aroma is sweet and malty with iced tea and citrusy, herbal, and resinous hops.  The flavor is a like a hard iced tea mixed with an imperial IPA. Sweet caramel malt with loads of grapefruit, resin, and herbal hop notes.  Full-bodied and syrupy with fairly low carbonation.  A little disappointing overall. I wouldn't say it's below average for the style, but I wouldn't say it's much above average either. Not so easy to drink.
POSITIVE	Poured from a bottle a hazy rusty tea color with a very small off-white head. Very little lacing to speak of.  Aroma is spicy with cinnamon and nutmeg and not overdone with the pumpkin.  Taste is nice. Definitely an ale first and a pumpkin ale second. Not too sweet or over-spiced.  Mouthfeel is smooth and dry with just a touch of carbonation.  Well done, O'Fallon. This is one of my favorite pumpkin ales.
POSITIVE	Poured a very bright golden color, but with absolutely no head or lacing. Nice clean malty scent, crisp and slightly fruity (bananas); just not very deep. Excellent flavors with a great wheat malt and a wonderful banana and slightly spicy taste. Goes down nice and smooth.
POSITIVE	I had a 500 ml bottle at tria the other day. The pour is amber/orange with a quickly receding white head. The aroma is full of sweet smoke, it reminds me of smoked bacon. The beer taste a little sweeter than it smells. Smoked meat is the dominant flavor, the smokiness lingers for a while in the finish. The beer was lighter in body than I expected, had a nice "clingy" mouthfeel. I really enjoyed this, I was surprised even the nonbeer drinkers liked it.
POSITIVE	S/ roasted malts hint of vanilla alcoholic  T/ sweet alchololic taste like the scottish wee heavys good winterbeer.  M/ leaves a long taste in your mouth a hint of vanilla and alchohol  D/ nice beer for the cold nights its says keep cool but drink it at room tempreture.
POSITIVE	Finally getting around to posting this review. Notes from 4/20/11.  Pours black with a sustaining off-white head. Lacing is great.  Subdued scents of bourbon lead the smell with some pine hops.  Lightly laced with bourbon notes, coffee, and pine hops. The resulting taste is complex with plenty of bitterness. The balance is also good.  Full mouthfeel with some stickiness and drying in the end.  This is very drinkable and very tasty. I hope they brew this again.
NEGATIVE	A: Pour is a cloudy amber with a thin head. Limited lacing.  S: The nose is of some citrusy hops, but not all that pleasant.  T: Piney hops leading to heavy malts. Again not an example of my favorite blend.  M: Body is fine.  D: Not a great beer for the money, sorry.
NEGATIVE	A beer stowed away from the Czech republic. Pilsner Urquell pours a dark gold with a crackling head that dies away fast.  Aroma of baked bread and cracker like yeast.  Has that "Euro Lager" characteristic with sweet buttery malts/adjuncts leading the way and just a slight bitter tea like hop to balance things out.  This beer has a very nice mouthfeel, semi-dry yet quenching at the same time. Spritzy carbonation gives a distinct zing on the palate.  Drinkability is pretty good. A good example of a czech pilsner, and quite drinkable at that.
NEGATIVE	Poured a reddish hue, hints of brown, with lively carbonation and a lace ring on top of a decent sour/tart fruit smell and hints of malt. Minor hop bitterness and sharp tart/sour fruit tastes that is alright but slightly offbalance. Some sticky malt is in this beer, but it is mostly a tart fruit. A decent ale with minor sweetness but a little too tart for me to drink all the time.
POSITIVE	Aquired this brew in a trade with mcallister. Thanks for sending me some great beer! Served at cellar temperature into a pint glass. Poured a very deep oily black color that no light could pass through. About two good fingers of tight, thick, bubbly dark brown head formed. Head had pretty good retention. Smell: Wonderful aromas of strong roasted coffee beans, sweet milk chocolate, notes of toffee and caramel rose from the glass. Awesome nose on this one. Taste: Tons of flavor here. Coffee, chocolate, roasted malt, and some spicey black licorice. All balanced out just about perfectly. Delicious. Mouthfeel was full and thick, with little carbonation. Pretty creamy and complex. I could drink this all day long. Great offering from Hoppin' Frog.
NEGATIVE	This use to be a good Oktoberfest, frankly it use to give the German Breweries a run for it. But, since Stoudts have been trying to get more commercial their beers have suffered for it.  I bought a case of this two years ago and it was beautiful. It had body and was well balanced. I bought another a year later; only to find out that they been contract brewing this in another state. Long and behold what I got was a beer that didn't taste like the one a year before, and Frankly, it didn't taste like an Oktoberfest at all. It was more like a Sam Adams Lager.  Avoid this beer and try something better, for the Micro that started it all in PA, they sure have gone down the tubes fast!
POSITIVE	I've been dying to try this beer and it did not disappoint.   A. One finger off white head sits atop a hazy, orange/red liquid giving way to lots of carbonation bubbles. The head never disappears - it stays about 1/4" thick to the end of the glass.   S. Citrus hops and caramel malt breadyness with a hint of rye spiciness. Really nice nose that becomes even more aromatic as it warms.   T. Very tasty mix of citrus hops (tangerine and grapefruit) with cracker and rye malt goodness providing nice balance and flavor interest. Finishes with prickly bitterness that invites you back for another sip.   M. Smooth mouth feel in a medium bodied frame. Nicely carbonated.   D. For a year round offering, this is an excellent beer (Founders does the same thing with their Porter and IPA). It perfectly melds big, bold hops with a nice malt bill for excellent drinkability. Glad to have finally tried this - it will be part of my regular purchase rotation.
POSITIVE	Appearance: amber-hued body with a thinnish, near white head. decent lacing.  Smell: toasty amber malts, nice smokey aromas  Taste: wow, nice and smokey,and prefectly balanced.   Mouthfeel: Medium-light body.   Drinkability: awesome and great for pairing with foods
POSITIVE	From a 12oz bottle.   Appearance - A vigorous pour yielded two fingers of mocha-colored spongy head which hangs respectfully for many minutes in my tulip. Viscosity is apparent as it is poured. Lots of spotty lace on the sides of the glass as I sip.  Smell -Milk chocolate, strong coffee with some dried dark fruit notes. Roasted malt, a bit of toffee-like sweetness and a bit of alcohol (but not at all boozy). Oatmeal is certainly in there, too!  Taste - Chocolate sweetness with a roasty Kona Coffee-like center. Much roasted flavor continues through the finish. A hint of bitterness from the roasted grain is kept in check with the smooth chocolate sweetness. Hops are there, but unobtrusive (unlike some over-hopped American stouts). The oatmeal comes through to help live up the the "breakfast" name. The alcohol is largely hidden from the palate, yet a bit of warmth is apparent as it goes down, even more so as it warms to room temperature.  Mouthfeel -Excellent carbonation and viscocity. Creamy on the tongue. No discernable alcohol burn on the tongue.   Drinkability- Just great. The balance of the sweet chocolaty malt and the roasted grain astringency is just about perfect. While I'm not a "beer for breakfast" guy, I could be persuaded if this stuff was about.  Comments- One of the best stouts I've ever had. Beautifully balanced roasted malt flavor along shines while delivering the coffee/chocolate punch. I'm so pleased that this beer seems to be in better supply lately.
POSITIVE	Pours a nice hazy orange color. not too much to say for head or lacing down this glass. The flavors are a bit malty at first but round out to a great hop bitterness. I wish there was a little more bitterness in the initial sip but what can you do. The hop flavor is one of orange juice 75% Grapefruit 25%. overall a great beer and one I would buy again. I love this stuff.
POSITIVE	Good until 12/12/07 3.8% ABV Picked up at the Kaufland Getrnksmarkt in Halle (Saale), Germany  Dark brown color that pours a light tan head of medium bubbles, dissipates (practically fizzes) fairly fast to a ring around the edge of the glass. Aroma is not very pleasant, like a stale light lager. However, whatever the offensive odor, I could not detect anything particularly off in the flavor. Little roasted malt taste as far as Schwarzbier goes, almost a brown ale in my opinion. Light to medium body with too much soda-y carbonation. Not a lot of hop character, but enough to balance out a mild, but not too sweet, malty backbone containing notes of something like a crusty german bread. Pretty light all around, so easy to drink, but Id recommend moving on to something more interesting.
NEGATIVE	Chunky head sits atop a amber colored brew. The lacing is fluffy and thick.   Familiar soft flowery aroma that seems to grace good ESBs. Malty, bready, and caramely aromas in the nose as well. Some mint and orange too.  I must say that the aroma is much more pleasurable than the taste. It has an extremely dry flavor profile. Malt gets lost on the palate behind the dryness and hops. Some bread, apricot pits, mint and suggestions of caramel.   I really think this beer would be great if it weren't so attenuated. The aroma is quite pleasant and the appearance appealing. The dryness just adds harshness and masks any malt flavors. Try it for yourself.
POSITIVE	Did you say this beer was called smoke? I wasn't quite sure I heard you right.  A-Black as a moonless night. 1/2" of caramel colored head that mostly dissipates, excpet for a small ring around the outside of the glass.  S-Bitter and black. Roasted "something".  T-Almost like liquid smoke, though I haven't chosen that as a drink. Roasted malts and pardon me again, "something". Can't really put a finger on it.  M-Good in all the right places. Flavor clings to the back of the throat.  D-Would be great after dinner.
NEGATIVE	An awesome accomplishment. Beer is one of the top mediums for distributing flavor. This ale shows the potential to capture an ingredient and showcase it with careful balance. The ruby grapefruit body looks so natural. The off pink head sits beautifully ontop and drops lacing with each sip. The aroma is faint zest with a flash of acidity. The taste is a rollercoaster ride. Light, crisp zest hits sweet cherry flesh back to a zingy acid bite. The cherry flashes from tart, to sweet, to subsiding zing. This ale showcases brewer talent. In a world of starbuckesque, flavor shot fruit beers; this one marches to its own accomplished drum. To the man behind Founders; I salute you!
POSITIVE	This beer was poured into a weizen glass at 42 from a 12 ounce bottle with a bottled on date notched on the label. Over three fingers of carbonated head resulted from the pour and swirl and pour. There was good head retention but no lacing as the head subsided. The beer was cloudy and pale golden.  Cloves and spices were predominant in the aroma. The beer also displayed fruitiness.  Spices, cloves, and bananas came across quickly. Cloves continued with the bananas fading later on.  This one was short and sweet and to the point. Good flavors were enjoyed throughout the mouth.  This was a simply made hefe with refreshing qualities. It would be a good session beer and thoroughly enjoyable during the warm summer months.
POSITIVE	I could dring this beer all night. Appearance: Clear Amber copper, with a 2" off-white head. Smell: Some hop bitterness, with a hint of sugary malt. Taste: Not an overpowering hop or malt profile. Actually, somewhat bland, with some pine hops. biscuity malt starts to emerge as the beer warms  Mouthfeel: Smooth. mildly carbonated. Overall: You may call this beer boring. Nothing stands out, but nothing overpowers. Enjoyable beer for a fall afternoon watching some football.
POSITIVE	Founders Black Rye pours a beautiful inky black with a creamy off white head. Aroma is a delcious mix of dark toasty malts, almost toasty, and citrusy centennial hops. The Rye character is much more pronounced in the flavor, and it works really well with the dark malts. The hop flavor really goes great with the black malts, I'm really surprised at how well it works. I really hope Founders is more available on the East coast soon!
NEGATIVE	Received a pint of ambery-orange brew with a decent head to start that disappeared quickly, with some lacing.  Scent is some faint sweet malt and pie spice.  Spices are right up front, with the sweet caramel/toffee malt coming through. Not too strong or overdone. Bit of a dry/tannin pucker finish on this one as well.  Lighter bodied than I expected, which keeps it from being cloying. Had one, and it was enough. I think for a seasonal pumpkin brew, they hit it pretty well, but I think I'd tire of this after getting a second pint. Trying very hard to review the characteristics of the beer here, and not my preferences, but these are inseparable. I think I'm done with the pumpkin brews for a while.
NEGATIVE	440 ml nitro can, tab pops and makes the hissing noise from the gases releasing. At first I was going to review this under the Caffrey's Irish Ale listing, but a closer look at the label, and this one is Premium Draught Beer, 'brewed and packaged by Coors Brewers Ltd, Burton-On-Trent. Label also show the proper serving instructions for a nitro can. A hard pour into my pint glass produces a very good looking cascade. Color is quite light, more gold than reddish, topped by a perfectly tight 1 inch foam head. Excellent retention, still foam at the end of the glass with thin rings of lace. Smell has some floral hops and some caramel, but the nirto pretty much kills any aroma. Taste, though light, has some roasted caramel malt and a hop finish. The mouthfeel is creamy and smooth, but at the same time, thin and watery. Good, not great, but enjoyable - and it looks cool to pour.
NEGATIVE	Has a nice deep amber color with a sweet aroma.  The flavor has sweet overtones, but does not have the body to support the sweetness.  The finish is good with lingering sweetness as well.  The mouthfeel is fairly thin for a Maibock, but decent.  A good beer, but not what I normally expect from Stoudt's.
POSITIVE	500 ml. bottle that pours a shady copper orange color with a huge rocky tan head that leaves nice lacing.The nose really has'nt much,a little fruity with some buttery caramel overtones.Taste is tangy,bitterness,and sweet hitting you in that order,the fruitness comes out at you right after and than the bitter kicks in again with some malt blending in.Medium with a satisfieing mouthfeel to this one.Quite a good ale,i must say,well worth a try,cause i'll surely have it again myself.
POSITIVE	12 oz. bottle poured into a Duvel Tulip Glass. This beer comes out a dense black color, with basically no highlights at all, it's pretty impressive. The color of the head is chocolate milk with extra syrup. Some pretty decent lacing.   When I cracked this open, I held it six inches or so from my nose and I could start to pick up the aroma and I knew it was going to be good. Smells like there is a good combination of malts, but the strongest is certainly chocolate, a semi-sweet dark chocolate. There are also strong notes of a natural roasted barley. Hint of smokiness and a touch of alcohol that warms your nose.  The taste is truly excellent. The large amounts of malts are even more detected in the flavor profile. It tastes like a blend of bittersweet, semi-sweet, dark, and milk chocolate all blended together if that makes sense. Big flavor, slight smokiness again, but not as much as the smell. A natural sweet roasty flavor. This is truly a tasty beer, like chocolate milk for adults.  The mouthfeel is pretty much perfect. It's certainly full bodied, and super smooth. Actually, smooth is an understatement, this sets a new standard for me, silky smooth sweetness. Excellent carbonation level and really not a bite from the alcohol which stands at 10.5%; it's barely detectable. Very easy drinking beer, anybody could polish this one off with ease.   Founders does it again, I have 2 left that I'd like to put a little age on to see how they do. Its the end of May right now, I'd love to see how an aged one taste in the winter, who know's maybe I'll edit this and give it another 5 or two.
POSITIVE	Raging orange, with patchy khaki foam all over the place. Aromas of fresh citrusy hops, orange and lemon zest, a bit of pine, and some nice sweet malts as well. Taste is hoppy as all get-out up front with some zesty citrus and pine flavors intermingling nicely with some interestingly sweet and quite British malt flavors. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and perhaps a bit thin for a Double IPA. Drinkability remains very nice, as this is a good simple example of a recently created style. Thanks Ev.
POSITIVE	Thanks to N. Ketchum for tracking down a bottle for me. I've been sitting on this one for a bit, and frankly I'm running out of space for my beer. It's nearly Christmas, it was a rough day at work, so what the heck, let's take the edge off.  Poured out of a 750 ml bottle into a snifter.  A) A nice vibrant red with a big fluffy two finger head that is quite pink. The head dissipates to a dusting. There is some nice sticky lacing left behind.  S) Raspberry, sugar, fresh raspberry, hint of yeast, more raspberry, a little alcohol as it warms.  T) Raspberry, raspberry puree, a kind of leafy earthy flavor in the middle, hint of alcohol on the backend, and a tartness that makes you crave that next sweet sip.  M) Excellent... soft, smooth and creamy. perfect amount of carbonation. Nice aftertaste.  O) Enjoyed this start to finish. Obviously not for anyone who doesn't like raspberry, or fruit beer in general. This is outstanding for the style. I'd love it if Founders made this a yearly release.
NEGATIVE	Appearance: Pours a nice clear light amber body with a fluffy head that lasts quite some time and leaves a fair amount of lacing down the side of the glass  Smell: A fair amount going on - primarily grassy and herbacious with an undertone of caramel malt and a hint of diacetyl  Taste: This ale packs a fairly aggressive assault on the taste buds - starts out fairly bland, but that is followed quickly by a bitter hoppy punch that tastes of sour apples; dries out into the finish and is slightly phenolic but there is a touch of sweetness on the tip of the tongue that joins the other flavors  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied, a bit slick and moderately carbonated  Drinkability: Perhaps it is the "burning witches" but this one just doesn't come together well for me; the flavors are schizophrenic and while I prefer an ale that is full of flavor, I just can't see returning to this one anytime soon
NEGATIVE	***200th Review***  Poured from a 12oz bottle into a tulip glass:  Appearance: Pours a very decadent reddish brown viscous color with almost 100% clarity. Does have some hop haze but really a filtered kind of look. The head is just off white, like eggshell with lots of little crators like honeycomb in it. Really sticky looking too. Not fantastic lacing but thats due to the booze in this guy.  Smell: The smell is unreal. Has a very sweet yet blanced sticky aroma of sugary pine needles, honeycomb and even some nice toasted pine cone. Also has that rich grapefruit aroma but caramalized. Sweet orange peel and candied lemons are very dominant.  Taste: This might be a dissapointment. going back to another sip to adjust my palate. Really not that overly hoppy. This is a dry hop monster but really this beer just tastes like hop steeped booze. Has a rum like sweetness mixed with the alcohol burn. Also has a a real bitter grapefruit and citrus pith overbearing taste on the finish mixed with the booze burn. On the plus side, its really malty and tries to get balanced but the booze and bitterness overbears.  Mouthfeel: For a beer this high in alcohol, its suprisingly carbonated well. really has the feel of a dipa, but overly bitter dry finish is not pleasing.  Drinkability: This beer is drinkable, but i would age it or at least let it sit open for a while to mellow. the bitterness and booze overpowers this. This one is very fresh and really needs time in the bottle. Drink this like a whisky, or a fine cognac in slow sips as its just too powerful and boozy right now.
POSITIVE	Bought this one directly from Sijsele,   golden color in the bottle, fruit in the nose, taste is of apples, spices, hoppy and sweet, good balance. Very refreshing, dry finish. Full enough for me. Their DIPA still is the best in line, but certainly good enough for a refreshment on a hot summer night!
NEGATIVE	Clear gold in colour with strong carbonation. Fairly neutral aromatically speaking, with some faint notes of buttered biscuits and lemon marmalade. A bit more complex in the mouth, with lemon pith and some earthy hop flavors, along with some more biscuity notes. Lingering light malt finish. Not too bad, but a bit more of a dry snappy finish would have made this a much better contender for an afternoon on a hot and sunny patio beer. Thanks pootz!
POSITIVE	On tap at the blue dog 6/10  A - fairly brown with reddish gold hue. Not much head to speak of or lacing for that matter, just a small ring with very thin, patchy lacing.  S - very strong notes of bourbon and cashews. The beer itself smells very rich.  T - huge assault of sweet cashews and bourbon. Very complex combination of flavors and oak. The maple syrup makes itself very noticed in the sweetness of the cashews and the finish provides a very refreshing orange/tangerine citrus note.  M - medium bodied, not very active on the palate carbonation wise and very chalky finish. A bit hot, but that's understandable.  O - this is without a doubt a dessert beer. It would pair extremely well with anything vanilla (especially ice cream) above anything else. This is an enjoyable sipper that falls well short of being too cloying, and I'd recommend you seek it out.
POSITIVE	Poured from a 12 oz. bottle. Leaves less than a one finger espresso-foam colored head that quickly fades, but does manage to leave a small amount of web-like lacing in places. Body is black.  Smell - coffee, espresso, bourbon, vanilla, spicy alcohol. Intense.  Taste - like the smell, but with dark chocolate and dark crusted maltbread showing up among the coffee, espresso, bourbon, vanilla, and spicy alcohol. Espresso, dark chocolate, dark crusted maltbread, and bourbon are strong on the finish. Alcohol is mostly well hidden. Very rich, very hearty, and delicious.  Mouthfeel - medium to full bodied, and dry.  Drinkability - this is excellent ale. It is very rich, hearty and delicious, but it really is more of a sipper than a session beer, and the high abv also limits sessionbility.
NEGATIVE	From a 12 oz. bottle with IBU and OG info (nice) but no freshness date. A murky dark orange with a thin instantly dissipating head despite an aggressive pour into a snifter. The aroma was pleasant but faint; some ripe orange and sweet malt.  Whatever flavor there was tasted watered down. Some grainy sweetness, some bitter in back, dry finish. Just thin and lacking in character. I expected more body from a "Scotch Style" as well, but this offering from the Seattle brewpub just didn't have the stones to earn the title. I lifted the kilt and didn't find anything there!
POSITIVE	2009 vintage, about 6 mos old. Amber red beer from a 12oz bottle. No head at all.  Smells like tea leaf, hops, a nice amount of malt sweetness as well.  Taste is more of a Barleywine than anything. And a great one at that. This is so much more balanced than when fresh. The closets thing Founders makes to one of my favorite styles. This is one of the nicest aging experiments yet! Sweet caramel malt, fruit, and some minimal citrus from the hops.  Perfect mouthfeel. Not syrupy at all. Just enough carb, Stellar.  Great stuff, dangerously drinkable at 12%. Very enjoyable.
POSITIVE	Thanks to weeare138 for this growler shared with tenderbranson69, consumed from a duvel tulip.    A dark ruddy brown with translucent clarity and thick beige cap which leaves a film of spotty lace and settles to a ring of fine beads. The smell is loaded with lots of wood and caramel w/ vanilla and bourbon providing a strong ester and slight spice w/ gentle alcohol indicating a high gravity brew awaits. The smell has light maple and nutty toffee accents in the mix. The feel is thick and rich w/ substantial strength apparent w/ mildly sweet texture and semi-high bitterness w/ a lot of astringency. The alcohol has a slight drying effect as it finishes w/ moderate roastiness.    The flavor of the Scotch ale is strong and rich with a toffee quality w/ pine from the hops and lots of vanilla from the barrel. The taste is nutty with earthy flavor and mild woody taste like a vanilla toffee spice with a moderately strong bourbon flavor. There is a bitter presence that dominates w/ a caramel candy and bitter presence w/ more sweetness evident in the taste as it warms. I was overjoyed when Mike offered this growler to me -A wonderful oak and bourbon element presents itself so well w/ lots of roasted and candy-like notes yet strength is high in the flavor and feel. It fits the style well and has exceptional drinkability in my opinion. I was truly grateful for the gift -I almost drank a whole growler save for 2 pints.
NEGATIVE	Thanks to kmpitz2 for the trade... As I popped the cap, this one foamed all over richlikebeer's pants and egajdzis' motel floor. Appears a hazy gold with a 2 finger, fizzy white head that slowly fades out. Scattered bits of chunky lacing are left around the glass. Smell is lemony, citrusy orange, and a touch of vanilla with some spicy yeast in the background. Taste is of the aromas but toned down a notch. There are also hints of juicy red apples mixed in the flavors. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, chewy, with vanilla, and orange bitterness lingering.
POSITIVE	2011 Bottle poured into Jackie O's snifter.  Pours jet black, viscous and oily in appearance, one finger of dark tan head. Good lacing and legs.  Smell is of vanilla, oak, coffee, with a hint of chocolate.  Taste is an amazing amalgamation of coffee, chocolate, caramel, vanilla, and roasted malt. The barrel is evident, but tannins are smooth and well integrated, especially for a barrel aged beer so young. Somewhat sweet, but never cloying. Absurdly drinkable for 11%.   Mouthfeel - fine carbonation complements the beer perfectly and is spot on for the style. Could use a little more body for my taste, but this is really nitpicking.  Overall - Exceptional - easily one of my favorite beers. I wish I could drink this everyday.
POSITIVE	WOW This is a great beer!!!  App: Darkish brown like most doppelbocks that I've seen imported to the usa. I don't know what the previous reviewer had, but this is definitely not light colored. The head sticks around and is an off white color, very light and fluffy.  Smell: Roasted meat... it reminded me of the roast boar I had a few days ago, except with better caramelization and a great smokiness with a subtle hint of chocolate.  Taste: The flavor integrates all of the aspects of the aroma while also adding a biscuity undertone. The smokey caramel flavors fill the mouth, making all other flavors secondary and supportive. It reminds me of eating a great piece of pork, slow cooked over an open fire.  Mouthfeel: The smokiness takes over, much the same way that it does in an alaskan smoked porter. It held all of my attention, with a nice clean bitterness at the end that doesn't overpower or take away from any of the nuances of the brew. It's smooth on the palate with no noticeable alcohol... I was flabergasted to see that this is an 8% brew.  Drinkability: Easily the most drinkable rauchbier I've ever had, and most drinkable doppelbock I've ever had. I could sit in front of a fire and drink myself straight to the abyss with this, never realizing it until the wee hours of the morning when I try to stand.
POSITIVE	On draught at Winking Lizard. Pours a lustrous orange/amber color with a medium ivory head and nice lacing. The aroma is floral hops with some citrus. Medium-bodied with floral hops, tropical fruit and malt. The finish is dry with a bitter and lingering hops flavor. Overall there are very few shortcomings with this IPA.
POSITIVE	12oz bottle poured into a wine glass. NOV1711 stamped on the back label. I suppose that means this bottle is only a week and a half away from no longer being fresh.  Appearance - Clear gold body with a pillowy one finger white head. Decent lacing.   Smell - Strong corn. Fresh hay. No off characters.  Taste - Strong corn. Basically a bigger, bolder, and smoother Dos Equis. Funny comparison, I know, but it's an effective one.  Mouthfeel - Light to medium bodied. Smooth and almost creamy.  Overall Drinkability - Pretty legit pils, but I've had much better.
POSITIVE	Poured from a bomber into a tulip, this beer is a hazy, almost opaque, yellow-gold coloring with a thin ring of head. Citrus, bready, and slightly spiced (coriander and cinnamon) aromas while you pour. The beer has smooth oat/cereal flavors, with nutty sweet highlights, tart citrus characteristics, and some light spicing. The aftertaste is sour, and again slightly spiced. The beer is creamy, yet effervescently carbonated. Spiced and sour finish lingers in mouth, transitioning to just sour after a little while. The booze notes are well balanced, also, making the beer smooth and tasty. An easier drink than most brews at this ABV, this one can get you into trouble.
NEGATIVE	10 oz pour at Craft Ale House in Limerick, served at a reasonably warm temperature.  Not sure what the exact description of this beer's "style is supposed to be, but first thing that came to mind was curmodgen minus hops with the bourbon/maple sweetness from CBS. Appearance is pitch black, viscous with a light fluffy mocha head that has surprising retention and sheets if lacing for the ABV. Aroma is rich, dark and sweet with caramel malt, bourbon, vanilla, molasses, etc. Flavor walks balance of almost being too sweet at times with balancing the sweetness with warming booze and malt. Very little hop or roast presence in the flavor. Mouthfeel is medium thick, chewy and mild carbonation. Overall a pleasant sipper, the maple flavors seemed a little more pronounced than CBS but flavor wise overall still not as complex as that beer. Alcohol is well hidden in this, but the overall sweetness is what limits how much of this I can drink/enjoy
NEGATIVE	12oz brown bottle 5.4% abv  Kirkland Signature Pale Ale was amber in color with good clarity. It had white head with decent retention and some spotty lacing. The smell was floral and citrus hop aromas with some malt. The taste was hops upfront with a light malt flavor and dry, lightly bitter finish. The mouthfeel was about average with a medium-light body and medium carbonation. The drinkability was average. This is a decent, but pretty tame Pale Ale.
POSITIVE	A: poured from a bottle into an imperial pint glass. poured a deep amber with a sticky head.  S: a slight hoppy scent, mildly floral.  T: a smooth amber but with a bite. the rye tickles your mouth through and through. rye flavoring lingers for a bit.  M: not as watery and thin as most ambers, this one has some body to it. One of the reasons i like it so much.  D: i could easily session this. it is hands down the best rye beer and the best amber i have had yet. i keep trying too find a rye that beats it. so far, no one comes close.
POSITIVE	2009 KBS, 11.2% ABV, 70 IBU's  A: Thick, viscous on the pour. Consistency of motor oil. Pitch black, opaque with a slight dark tan head which dissipates quickly.  S: The aromas on the forefront are bourbon and oak which lends nice vanilla notes. That is followed by an onslaught of gourmet bold coffee and dark chocolate. This one makes my mouth water... always a good sign. I could literally get lost in the aroma ... the best aroma I have ever experienced in a beer  T: Wow, talk about balance for such a big beer. The bourbon and coffee play off of each other flawlessly with undertones of vanilla, dark chocolate, and oak. As the glass warms, different flavors are accented. First it was the bourbon, then the coffee, then the chocolate. All of it comes together with a presence of alcohol at the end, but at 11.2%, this is to be expected. I am thankful I got my hands on a few of these.   M: A very thick body that is silky smooth.   D: Simply delicious. 'Nuff said.
POSITIVE	Poured from a 12 oz bottle into my trusty snifter. This is a 2010 vintage - bottle dated 4/18/10  A: As black and thick as they come. A very thin tan head fades quickly. Massive alcohol legs and decent lacing considering the ABV.  S: Mostly bourbon. Some roast, some cocoa and just a wee bit of vanilla. I get a bizarre "dustiness" and some oaky tannins in there as well.  T: Again, as in the nose, mostly bourbon up front...but I get more roasty coffee bitterness in the taste than in the aroma. Tons of oak. The alcohol isn't very noticeable at all. Some really thick baker's chocolate coming through at the end. This beer isn't necessarily sweet though. Definitely a good bit of bitterness left on the tongue.  M: Very smooth and creamy. Coats the throat as it goes down. Minimal carbonation. Chewy as hell.  O: I think this was actually a bit dissapointing to my tastes. I don't think I was expecting so much bourbon flavor. To me it's the dominant characteristic of this beer. The roastiness and the mouthfeel are inarguably top notch, but they are in a distance second...and that faint dustiness in the aroma is offputting. I would consider this a hybrid of an imp stout and a scotch ale. I'm not trying to be a hater, cause I LOVE Founders, but this is just slightly better than Backwoods if you ask me.
POSITIVE	Poured into stout glass.   Appearance: Thick and black with a creamy thin two fingers of tan head. Decent amount of lacing.   Smell: Strong coffee and chocolate aroma with some oatmeal and roasted malts. Smells just like an iced coffee.   Taste: Strong coffee flavor with some bitter dark chocolate and roasted malts. Solid presence of oats throughout. Hints of hop bitterness in the finish.   Mouthfeel: Pleasant bitterness and thickness. Very drinkable.  Overall: An outstanding stout. One of the best in the world.
NEGATIVE	Poured from a 12oz bottle into a mug  A_Dark tan head, rich and frothy; dissipates to a nice thin top. 100% opaque. Black body, nice looking. Some lacing  S_Earthy, grilled and smoked bacon. Very strong  T_Strong charcoal, applewood smoked bacon, mellow and balanced  M_Medium carbonation, not mouth coating  D_Flavor so strong that its hard to drink too many of these
NEGATIVE	Golden in color with a sustaining white head and excellent lacing. This is a fine looking APA.  The aroma features lemony pine hops with either an adjunct or wheat smell...it is hard to tell.  Up front, the taste is nice, loaded with citrusy hops. The back end is thin and in comes an adjunct lager like taste. It reminds me of a combination of Gumballhead and Labatts.  Thin in the mouth and rather uninspiring.  An interesting pale but I don't understand what it is trying to create. It would be nice to know the background of this beer.
POSITIVE	On tap at the brewery. As close as Founders will get to a lager, it reminded me of a dry hopped lager. Light yellow with no head, and a decent hop flavour. A faint hop aroma.Average mouthfeel. Nice summer beer.I am used to the understated hop taste of an English hopped bitter. Easy drinking, good flavour for sessionabl alcohol.
POSITIVE	A= Pours a hazy brown color leading onto black but still sticking with a definite brown that is a hazy and an amber color when you hold it up to the light. The head is a little disappointing being just half a finger high and falling to a thin sheet on the beer. This this sheet leads to some solid lacing and actually has some pretty average retention.  S= Vanilla! A total vanilla bomb in my opinion. Smells very very similar to some sort of vanilla ice cream or a pudding. There is a little bourbon smell to it but nothing compared to the solid vanilla that comes from the barrels. There are also some typical Wee heavy characteristics in it however they are all blended into the delicious vanilla smell. I almost get some coconut in the nose as well. Really tasty smelling.  T= Here the bourbon comes through a little more however the vanilla coconut taste is intense. This is a total vanilla bomb. The heavy sweeter malts are there as typical from Wee Heavy's. In my opinion this is the perfect beer to put in a bourbon barrel. The vanilla flavor is the ultimate complement to the sweet malts in the Wee Heavy. Mellowed out perfectly. As it warms up the bourbon taste mellows more and the awesome sweetness follows through more. I really notice a ton of woody oak flavor as well. Really one of the best barrel aged beers I've ever had.  M= Totally smooth and mellow. My only problem with this is that i wish it would have a little less carbonation. Awesome otherwise. You can't have everything I suppose  D= Great beer. One of the best beers I've ever had. A total Vanilla bomb and everything you could want from a barrel aged beer. This has all the great woody oak flavors you can ask for without having over powering bourbon flavors and just enough of everything to make this a great beer.
NEGATIVE	12oz bottle into snifter. A big thanks to HosP for this one!  A: Pours a brownish-ruby amber with an unimpressively thin tan head that quickly disappeared despite a very rigorous pour.  S: Big perfumey citrus hops with notes of grapefruit, mango and caramel malt. T: Much more a barleywine than a big DIPA. Much maltier than the nose suggested. Hops come through with very fruity and citrusy. That said the hop flavor can easily be described as "juicy" with a honey-like sweetness to it. Flavors are bold and powerful. Aftertastes lingers with a light bitterness and tangerine rind flavor.  M: Full bodied with low carbonation and a viscous heavy mouthfeel. Very thick and heavy. Big alcohol presence that isn't hot on the palate but warms yours belly. Bitterness is surprisingly low for an IPA, but then again, this tastes like a big barleywine. D: Not enough carb and a big alcohol punch make this beer drinkable, but not super enjoyable. A bit of a letdown. Aged a few years this would make a heck of a barleywine. Right now it's just an okay DIPA.
NEGATIVE	A good pour left a good head that I could see (as if in slow motion) go from big and froathy to thin and bubbly. Transparent. Typical aroma, a little more held back on the corn starch than others. Fairly clean actually. Mouthfeel is clean as well, carbonation under control. Ahh, aftertaste is where they hid the corn starch! A decent texture but I couldn't care much for the flavour. Good enough job at 6%! Head even left lacing, not bad. Not alot of comprimise in this one, to its credit.
POSITIVE	"Brewed with English malted barley and double dry hopped with Centennial and Amarillo hops".  It's small batch-brewed, with definite home-brew qualities!  A: Orange-bronze; hazy with a little particulate; off-white head has some retention & leaves hints of lace.  S: Plenty of grapefruit citrus, apricot and a touch of floral & pine aroma. Quality pale malt (biscuity).  T: Grapefruit & orange citrus hop flavours dominate, some apricot, quality pale malt in background (biscuity), touch of amarillo-aspirin flavour; crisp bitterness is very pleasant (not harsh).  M: Moderate body is slightly creamy and fairly acidic; moderate carbonation.  D: Hop heads should love it!
NEGATIVE	A: Cloudy amber with a foamy, off-white head. Good lacing all around.  S: Sticky, malty sweetness with an alcohol tinge. This has the deep, almost cloying fruitiness of a barley wine and only a resinous hop presence.  T: Alright, so if the first few sips had me wondering whether this was really an IPA of any ilk, the taste tells me that it's clearly a barleywine. There's a strong mix of flavors--caramel, brandy, stewed fruit--slapped away by a burning hop presence at the beginning and end of each sip. Alcohol notes punch through strong. This is one aggressive, bruising beer.  M: Smooth and heavy, though the 'heat' (alcohol and bitterness) of this beer really linger in the mouth. The cumulative effect is intimidating, not necessarily in a good or bad way...but near the end of my glass, I had to steel myself for each sip. Is it good to be scared of a beer like this?  D: Deceptively easy at first, such that I would have thought about having two. But by the end of a pint, I'm done. This would make a great nightcap.  Overall, Devil Dancer is a challenging barley wine with a marvelous mix of flavors set against one of the strongest hop bases I've ever tasted. It's not always pleasant, but there is something intoxicating (no double entendre intended) about such a strong brew. While it's noteworthy for being so aggressive in all of its flavors, there are better, more balanced (and equally strong) examples of DIPAs and barley wines; nonetheless, it's absolutely worth checking out.
NEGATIVE	A: This beer pours velvet black. Even the head on this thing is dark! It's completely opaque, and the head is a thin dark brown. The head doesn't last long, and leaves only a ring with little foam bubble lily-pads.  S: I could smell it from my desk before even getting near it. It has a coffee smell. It smells like roasted nuts, and I get a bit of alcohol smell. It doesn't smell bad, so I'd put it about average.  T: Immediately I get a dark herbal and fruity flavor. Similar to figs and licorice. It has a lot of sweetness and has a roasted flavor but isn't bitter. There is definitely alcohol flavor in this one. It's not all that impressive, but there is some complexity to it. It probably just needs to age more before I drink it.  M: The mouthfeel is pretty good, it has a decently smooth and sweet character to coat the mouth. The light bitterness hangs out for a bit but goes away quickly. One of the main detracting feelings can be attributed to alcohol burn.  O: Overall I thought it was an alright beer. I probably wouldn't get it again if looking for an oatmeal stout or a stout of any kind. After being aged it would probably be a lot nicer, but there are many beers out there that taste much better straight from the beer store, out of my fridge, and into a glass.
POSITIVE	Dark, dark black, thick liquid.  Pours out with no head until the very end when a smallish, beige head forms and dissipates leaving a nice cap of tiny bubbles.  Extremely large nose on this one. Complex dark chocolates with a French roasted coffee-bean quality. Alcohol is present as are figs, sherry and roasted malts.  Milky smooth on the palate. Absolutely brilliant mouthfeel as always from Founders. A nice chalky finish. Chocolately sweet up front on the tongue. Bourbon features in the middle and a touch of coffee bitter on the back end.  This is stout truly IS brilliant!
NEGATIVE	This beer is huge in Greece, It was everywhere. Had it a few times on draft in Rythmno, Crete. Kind of a soft, delicate aroma and flavor, nothing mind-blowing, but quite nice. There was a lasting flowery impression from the gentle hops. Granted, it was overall not a really exciting beer, but it exceeded my expectations quite a bit.
POSITIVE	Bottle poured into a pint glass,served at about 45 degrees.  A. Held up to the light, the body is a very dark hazy amber,with about a half inch off white head and little carbonation.  S. I get alot of caramel malts and some oak in there,some faint vanilla.Definatly some alchohol in the nose.  T. Caramel right a first, sweet candy malts def seems like some oak and bourbon, some grainy bread. I taste the alchohol in this but it isnt bad at all.  M. Beautiful heavy chewy mouth thats coats the mouth nicely extremely smooth.  D. I could drink three or four of these no problem in a sitting very drinkable to me.  This beer in my opion is awesome, even better as it warms up! I highly recommend this malt bomb.
NEGATIVE	(From notes)  A - Poured with a thin tannish head that dissipated pretty quickly. Almost completely black color, but had hints of ruby and brown.   S - Nice roasted malt aromas, with some malty sweetness followed by bittersweet chocolate  T - Really bitter (not hop bitter) overall, and not nearly as roasty as suggested in the aroma. The taste hints at some elements I would associate with the style, but doesn't get close enough  M - Pretty thin MF, closing in on a little too thin. Carbonation is pretty high given the style.   D - Drinkability is pretty low given the lack of stand out flavors, and the bubbliness of the carbonation. Didn't really demand another sip.   Overall, this is isn't the best example of the style that I've had, but not the worst brew ever. The brew looked and smelled great, but the rest of the elements just weren't there.
NEGATIVE	appearance: Pours a low, off white head that recedes to a ring around the glass and a very thin layer on the surface. The beer is a rich orange-amber with some floaters suspended throughout.  smell: The dominant, and pretty much only, aroma is that of a light to moderate sweetness of toasted and lightly peaty malts. Some subtle aromas of dark sugars and a light, aged hop aroma. Slightly earthy.  mouthfeel: The carbonation is a smooth light-medium, and the body between medium and heavy.  taste: Toasted and lightly flavored malts dominate and lend a moderate sweetness. The flavors here are subtle, and not as smoky/peaty as I'm used to in a scotch. Light hop flavor and a drying, light bitterness. Not really much else to it.  drinkability: Easy to drink, but an average scotch ale  A gift from Seattle
POSITIVE	Appearance: A hazy yellow body. The head is a wispy white foam, but unfortunately it did stay long.  Smell: Banana and yeast are the backbone here, but there are some cloves present.  Taste: The yeast is the background but there are bananas present in the background with some vanilla. The cloves are present in the finish.  Mouthfeel: The carbonation balances the yeastiness and allows for a very nice mouthfeel.  Drinkability: Another great summer beer.
POSITIVE	Bottle poured into a tulip glass.  A- It poured with a thin, off-white head that quicly dropped to a light lace that left a nice sticky web on the side of the glass. The body was a hazy, golden-orange.  S- Initially I was met with a blast of grapefruit hops mixed with some grassy tones. Sweeter malts stay in the background of the aroma.  T- It had a really interesting flavor at first sip. There was a generous amount hops matched with a good malty backbone. I'd say the hops gave off a grassy flavor early and finished with a grapefruit/citrus bite. Sweet malts, maybe caramel, hold everything together. Flavors mellow slightly later in the bottle  M- Pretty dry, with light carbonation and thicker feel. Heavy hopping and higher alcohol content make for a quite the bite.  D- A healthy dose of hops and booze make this a definite sipper. A semblance of balance make it a decent drinker.
POSITIVE	650ml bottle, printed on label: "50 cents from every bottle purchased donated to Woodlands Oak Tree Preservation"  Pour a very clear apple juice-gold...small/medium white capped head that fades fairly quickly...the nose is light and fresh: some wheat, grassy notes and a pinch of lemon zest, some bready & grainy notes as well...subtle palate, a steady crispness throughout followed by a bakers-yeast sorta finish....nice lingering of soft bitterness....the mouthfeel was nicely fresh, light and kinda perky....great drinkability, this beer goes down smoothly but remains fresh and quenching and has you asking for more...quite enjoyable
POSITIVE	Poured into a chalice, split with my good friend Ed.   A:Dark amber in color, pours thick with little carbonation. Appears flat with almost no head and no significant lacing as if the sheer weight of the beer pulls it down the sides of the glass.   S: My first, and most prevalent, thought: barleywine (this is a good thing)  T:Incredible. A mix of spicy,sweet and hoppy bitterness, with a fair amount of malts, this beer is wild.   M: Thick, verging on chewy, but good nonetheless.  D: The alcohol is well hidden, but lingers in the aftertaste.   This is definitely a sipper, but I recommend.
POSITIVE	A deep, dark amber color, with a three finger thick, cream colored head forms on top. The head laces slowly down the glass. The smokiness is an incredible scent, it blends itself with a malty sweetness and doughiness. There is no real hop aroma in this beer. The malt hits the palate with a mild sweetness and the smoky flavor, that dominates and envelopes around every taste bud. Then a surprisingly mild citrus bitterness finishes the taste out. A very smooth feel, with a mild crispness, and is very silky along the palate. This is an incredible beer, there are styles that you have to taste from the source, this beer is it. Throw this at some smoked ribs or a pulled pork sandwhich. Plus, why doesn't barbaque places have this beer on tap or bottle.
NEGATIVE	Bottle from World of Beer, Clearwater, FL.  Pours a hazy yellow color with a large frothy white head that mostly lasted with fair lacing. Moderate citrus, wheat and yeasty aroma. Light to medium body with a sticky texture and lively carbonation. Medium sweet flavor with a medium sweet finish of moderate duration.  This drinkable soft beer met my expectations.
POSITIVE	Received as a bonus in a trade from Czoch. Thanks!  Good Lord! Audible pffft as I pop the top, and a massive head formed the minute I poured it into the glass. It went into a Duvel tulip, and seriously took me 5 minutes to pour the damn thing. Looking through other reviews, seems some people have this problem and some don't - a bad batch or quality control issues? Big off-white head, forming huge bubbles as it falls. Aroma: they weren't kidding about the dry-hopping. This is 6 months old, what was it like fresh? Great example of Cascade hops. Unfortunately, seems kinda like a one note chord. It's nice, would be very drinkable outside in the summer, but not too much going on in it. Worth trying, though, especially if the head is under control.
POSITIVE	Bottle is adorned with a label showing a vintage 40's auto before which stands a young, aspiring baseball-player in uniform. This is a clear, robust, copper colored bier, atop which sits a creamy albeit fine tan layer of bubblies. A bit of lacing edges the sides, but not a lot. The nose exudes caramel, as well as a Ringwood-like aroma. I'd like to see a bit more ooomph there, though. Body is more than medium, and it's quite smooth on the tongue. How smooth? Like JohnnyP taking-a-cabbie-for-a-ride smooth! Flavor, as with the aroma, has a pleasant caramel malt lean to it. A hint of alcohol can be detected, and it has a combo of a buttery flavor and floral hops in the finish. This is a good offering, and somewhat reminds me of Gearys Hampshire. My thanks go to the aforementioned JohnnyP for the bottle. Prosit!!  overall: 4.15 appearance: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4.5 | mouthfeel: 4.5 | drinkability: 4  609
POSITIVE	Pale copper with substantial head. Lacing is sticky and thick.   Strawberry, mango, brown sugar, grapefruit juice, and spruce aromas.   Sticky sweet. Begins with caramel, brown sugar, and tobacco. Lots of bubble gum, pine and naval orange in the middle. Finishes sweet, bitter, and a bit boozy. Tastes better than it smells.   Medium-high mouthfeel with light carbonation. Pretty good DIPA-a little sweet and the hop character is nothing special, none the less pretty good.
NEGATIVE	22 oz. bomber,  A: Pours a pale yellow, soft white head, fairly good retention per the style.  S: Some grainy malt notes, light hops, mild inoffensive nose.  T: Direct pilsner esque barley malt flavour, light hopping. Again, mild but the malt flavour is good.  M: Light-bodied, crisp, very clean, refreshing.  D: A solid pale lager, not as much flavour as I wanted, maybe akin to Full Sail Session is what I was looking for. As an innocuous easy drinking lager it did its job.
POSITIVE	Appearance: dark black, next to no carbonation, no head  Smell: strong burnt coffee, oats, and molasses  Taste: more burnt coffee and a little toasty smoke, some oak  Mouthfeel: I found it heavy and chewy  Drinkability: I am not always a stout person, but I find this excellent for its style. It is what I will reach for in its style..There are lots of layers here..A very complex beer...I could have several
NEGATIVE	Tasted in Taba, Egypt.  Typical lager appearance, pale golden with bubbly head that quickly disappears. Level of carbonation very high.  Start spritzy, sweetish. Body light, malty with a growing hoppy note. God knows what kind of hops it is. Finish bitter, aftertaste somewhat stale.  Not recommended to assertive travelers. Will pass as a thirst-quencher only.
POSITIVE	12 ounce bottle poured into snifter  Pours a very bright amber/orange color with a very small quick fading head after an aggressive pour. No lacing or retention. Almost looks like bourbon in the glass. Nose is dominated with bourbon with faint hints of malts, alcohol, orange peels and breads. Pretty unique and complex smell. Taste is pretty alcoholic with lots of bourbon on the quaff. I get some of the maple syrup in the taste but I think a lot of this has faded since bottled. Some sweet honey and citrus fruits come out as it warms. A very slow sipping beer, again almost like a glass of chilled bourbon. Mouthfeel is full bodied and quite alcoholic. This is a unique and complex brew that I think will age very nicely. The alcohol can really cool down and I think a lot of the other flavors that are overpowered right now will start to come out.
POSITIVE	Picked up a six pack to enjoy over the weekend. Pours a garnet red into my Perfect Pint Glass. The hops aroma jumps out of the glass at you. The big aroma did not translate to the taste though which was incredibly well balance with some grassy malts. Not nearly as hoppy as I was anticipated. The bitterness was moderate, but enjoyable. Through three bottles, it proved to be an extrordinarily well balance and well crafted American IPA.
POSITIVE	Thanks to Murrayswine for this bottle.  Dark and murky brown...just one half of a shade lighter than black to the trained eye ;-p ... with a thin peanut butter colored head.  Aroma is strong on coffee with some bitter chocolate and faint crushed oats.  The flavor is practically a liquid form of the smell. It starts with a wallop of coffee that drags you into some dark bakers chocolate. The oats I picked up in the smell aren't really noticeable in the taste. A sweetness is present, but I can't figure out where it's coming from. I find myself enjoying this and I am not a stout or coffee kind of guy. Impressive.  Mouthfeel is thick and chewy . Dry and slightly bitter aftertaste makes me want to take another sip to moisten my mouth once again. The alcohol is hidden very well. I should have no problem finishing this one as I usually can't get through an entire bottle of stout. Maybe I am just developing more a taste for them or maybe this one is just that good.
NEGATIVE	A- Poured very dark crimson into my snifter fairly aggressively. A head builds to one finger but dies down to a nice frothy cloud and creamy ring. Leaves some very fine lace in good amounts.  S- Hop madness, one of the hoppy-est aromas ever. So much hops it is hard to distinguish what they lend, it is almost like smelling a bag of fresh hop flowers. There are certainly a lot of sweet fruit and citrus notes, as well as some pine. It actually smells overall like a hopped fruit punch, considering the malt in the background. Some alcohol.  T- I really dont understand how a lot of the fruit is lost from the aroma to the taste. The hops notes in the flavor are mostly pine. The rest of the taste is a general bitter flavor, some malt and alcohol notes. Some residual sweetness lingers. This flavor is just so monstrous, too much hops and bitters.  MF- Very creamy moderate body. Moderate carbonation slightly stings the tongue. A hugely bitter coat is left on the palate that is saturated with the flavor only achieved by chewing on a real hop.  DB- I guess this is what a Triple IPA would be like, way too much hops and bitterness. I could probably eat a Jolokia pepper and still taste this on my palate afterward. I have to give credit for making such a thing but it is not my personal taste, too extreme. I really like the aroma but the flavor is too over the top. Worth a shot and this is probably the first IPA I would age because it probably could get better with less hop influence. Price is fairly high and the huge flavor makes this one not that drinkable.
POSITIVE	Appearance Typical porter color: deep dark brown, almost black, with a small cocoa powder colored head  Smell Delicious! Big smell wafting off this of dark roasted coffee and dark chocolate  Taste & Mouthfeel Oh wow. Really, really tasty porter here; big flavors like a stout, but really smooth and not overly bitter; sweet like an iced mocha; just delicious; velvety texture, medium bodied; at 6.5%, this is big for the style, slightly hindering drinkability, but it tastes so good!  Overall  I can't think of a better porter than Fouders'. This is so good! It absolutely sets the standard.
NEGATIVE	The appearance of this offering from Founders is a golden tone with a bright white head. It has a nose of lemon, pine and some subdued hops. While the taste has some spices such as sage and cloves. The citrus hops are also present, with more lemon and some grapefruit. MF is medium with a lower carbonation level. All in all, a pretty good beer, but not one of my favorites from these guys out of Michigan.
POSITIVE	Impressed with this porter at a recent sampling. First sample for my Porter tasting night to commemorate the start of the NFL season. A- Pours an opaque dark brown hue, small brown head that is mostly sustained, fair lacing  S- Dark chocolate malts with creamy espresso tones, hints of dark fruits (raisins, berries), subtle alcohol presence T- Initial taste is dominated by toasty coffee/espresso malts with chocolate in the background, transitions to some caramel/toffee flavors, some oak/woody tones, finishes with a dry aftertaste with a nice alcohol warming sensation M- Big taste but fairly medium/light body, mouthfeel is somewhat watery, carbonation is quite lively throughout and definitely stands out D- Wow, I can not believe this porter is at 8%abv it is too smooth, the alcohol presence is superbly masked and I could drink this all night long. I would pick this up again when in the mood for a solid, tasty, easy drinking baltic porter
NEGATIVE	This was either your favorite or just another mediocre brew among the friends at the table. A very slight golden color, some hazing, Thin white head that faded quickly. The nose was week but bits of honey and malt came through. I'll say it was very complex on the tongue but nothing really stood out at me as very good. It hit the tongue with certain honey and malt. Across the tongue was good acidity and ginger tones. Finished with some decent hop & more honey. OK feel and OK drinkability. Just not something I'd want multiple pints of.
POSITIVE	Jet black with lots of creamy head. Boozy and roast stout aroma. Some chocolate. Very faint rye, nothing like Red's Rye.Creamy and well carbonated taste, toast, spice, nothing too intense. Buit of roast on aftertaste. Very drinkable. Thanks Dr. Jay.
POSITIVE	12oz bottle, served in a pint glass.  A - deep, dark brown color with a small tan head that fell to a light layer, but left a good deal of lacing.  S - sweet smelling brew, molases and chocolate aromas.  T - very good tasting stout, sweet molases and roasted malt flavor with a light espresso bitterness on the finish.  M - medium/full bodied, smooth and creamy.  D - extremely enjoyable, very highly recommended.
POSITIVE	Pour is black. Jet black, and completely opaque, almost as if someone had mistakenly poured motor oil into my glass. Had about 2 inches of a deep brown head that hung around for a while before vanishing. Aroma was incredible. Sweet, sweet smell. All roasted malt, along with a strong chocolate smell. Notes of coffee as well. The taste was exactly like the smell. Very sweet, with chocolate and coffee tastes along with it. Abosolutely incredible. Not much else to say. Delicious. This was a very thick drink, as was expected. Like I stated before, very sweet drink...although too sweet. Well balanced enought that I could have several of these and not think twice. This may be my favorite beer to date. I can't say enough about B.O.R.I.S. Highly recommended.
POSITIVE	Pours a black, very dark color. The head is big tan and creamy very nice.  The nose is smooth coffee with hints of cocoa roasted malts a ever so slight hint of alcohol at the end.   The taste, well let me start by saying I don't like coffee or atleast the american version. This is not like american coffee. The flavor is sweet to start very sweet but as the sweet begin to get to be to much the bitter roasted malts and the flavor of coffee come in. The coffee taste lingers and never turns burnt. Slight creamy taste with real cocoa finish with a dry taste as bakers chocolate would. The moutch is nice low carbonation tickle the tip of the tongue while the bitterness coats the middle...as this beer sits, open in my glass not a celler, it tend more toward cloying as the carbonation fades but the cocoa remains.  Nice brew but don't drink to many...
NEGATIVE	Cloudy orange-amber pour from the brown 12 oz. bottle has a very thin and short lived head. The aroma is grassy, grainy, and slightly yeasty, and is not quite right for the style either. The taste is sweet-sour with a dollop of earthiness, but only a mild to low level of hop bitterness. The mouthfeel is thick and sticky, but aftertaste is quite flat. No hop burps after this timid IPA.  May be I got a bottle past its prime, but there is no way to tell due to the lack of any dates.
POSITIVE	Well...a little confusing. I think this beer may be mislabeled, but I still enjoyed it. Color was a nice light amber with a decent head. The smell was a bit odd. Oily perhaps, I couldn't pinpoint it. Taste was a bit on the light side with no hop burst or maltiness. Somewhat neutral (but not balanceddue to lack of hoppiness or maltiness) Mouthfeel was good...smooth. Drinkability was ok...no pronounced aftertaste...smooth. Once again, not a bad brew, but as others have said, not an ESB.
POSITIVE	a: This was an unbelievably pale golden color, quite clear. It was served to me with a short, fizzy white cap.  s: Clean smelling overall with bright, spicy hops and muted biscuity cereal.  t: Mirrors the smell, with the addition of a nice, mineral flavored finish.  m: Crisply carbonated, pretty much spot-on for the style.  d: A great local session option. When fresh, I could drink these all day.
POSITIVE	Poured from a 500 ml bottle into a chalice style glass  A: Pours thick and viscous like a light motor oil - a dark brown, near black leaving a very thin layer of tan bubbles that recede to an unevenly spread ring around the glass. I just looks like it's gonna be good.  S: Not much. Some very faint chocolate malt and something else... almost, but not quite, black licorice.  T&M: A long pull wraps the tongue in an envelope of complex creamy malts with plenty of hints of chocolate and some sort of spice that I just can't place and secondary waifs of molasses. It's a touch sweet and has tons of character to go along with that ABV. The carbonation is subtle and makes for a creamy texture. All of the flavors pull together wonderfully and stay true all the way to the end. The finish is malty chocolate with a hint of coffee bitter and some pleasant warming in the finish. There is just a touch of alcohol at the very end or else this would be just perfect for me.  D: I think I could drink this until I was dreaming. The flavors are beautifully matched and the alcohol is kept at bay with the velvety goodness that grabs your attention. Absolutely enjoyable and highly recommended!
POSITIVE	A - Black as night with thick mocha head, beautiful. Limited lacing though, somewhat surprised about that, would have loved a touch of that as well. S - Sweet deep coffee notes; I drink my coffee black and this tastes nearly like that. Hints of chocolate and smoke as well. Nice roasty elements from both the choc and coffee.  T - Immediately a bitter coffee flavor is present. It is followed by berrylike coffee notes (dark cherry) almost. It is followed by dark chocolate and fruits. Cocoa flavors are very abundant. Oatmeal too, perhaps? MF - Quite viscous, goes down nice and smooth. Limited alcohol presence.  DB - 2 beers or three would be great. High drinkability at this ABV.  Very good beer, although I would say that it slightly overhyped. As far as price for enjoyment goes, it is very good.
NEGATIVE	From the tap, served in a standard pint glass. Made a decent appearance, poured an opaque dark coffee brown with a small foamy head that settled into a thin, slightly bubbly lacing, moderate carbonation overall. Had a sweet roasted malty nose, coffee, fruity and oatmeal sweet. A crisp, smooth medium bodied mouth feel, above average drinkability. Sweet roasted malty taste, coffee and fruity, a nice alcohol warmth shows up in the middle, the sweetness has almost a soda syrupy-like quality, some toffeeness towards the end and a dry-ish sweet roasted malt finish. A good oatmeal stout, tasty and quaffable, worth ordering. Certainly a better oatmeal stout than what is served just up the river in Fort Madison at the Lost Duck. Named after, well, just go out the front door of the pub, turn right and look.
POSITIVE	Pours a viscous black and creates a textbook appearance for the style. Nice 1 inch vanilla and mocha head with some carbonation visible. Smell is of coffee and chocolate, as well as dark roasted malts. Up front the taste is coffee followed by a large dose of roasted malt. It is drinkable for a bigger stout and just incredibly well done. Complex and almost perfectly blended. A go to for sure. I would like to see this beer at 9%abv though.
POSITIVE	A: Pours Hazy Dark Reddish Orange. Sunlight shines on my glass exhibits the lighter colors. Looks almost like a mixed drink, not much real carbonation, not your typical brown dubbel.  Note: Poured at the bar, by the time it arrived no head.  S: Familiar Belgian Yeast, sweet fruits, slight booze. Cant really make out saffron, but my sense of smell for spices isnt great.  T: Wow. Multiple levels of flavor. Usual sweet tasting dubbel, plus well blended taste of fruit and spice, but not spicy like a saison can be. Seems the orange + saffron combined very nicely to make an elixir that is very inticing, fruit, honey notes are a very nice addition to the sweet dubbel taste. Very tiny bit of fruit aftertaste leaves you wanting more.  M: See Taste. Yummy, smooth. Flavors swirl across the palate leaving its mark.  D: Very High. Didn't taste any alcohol in this beer, and I could have easily drank pint after pint but I had to drive home and they dont serve it in growlers.  The best dubbel I've ever had. Never had Westy 8, so I can't compare it with the top rated dubbel but I've had several of the top 10-15 rated dubbels and the taste IMO is better than those.   Highly Reccommended. If youre going to CBC and they still have this on draft, do yourself a solid and grab one.
POSITIVE	Bottle to pils glass, aggressive pour. A - One finger head, lasts about a minute with good lacing. Warm hazy copper color, some fine sediment (unfiltered beer). S - Felt that beer had a muted smell, really had to be concentrated on to be appreciated. Smelled like a smaller version of other IPA's T - Sweet start with grapefruit fruiteness and hop bitterness. Did not notice a signifigant malt presence. Slightly grassy, tame flavor. Good never the less. Good mild hop bitterness that lasts long after the beer is gone. M - Pleasant tingle on the tongue, smooth drinking beer. All in all this was a very enjoyable beer. This is tamer than other IPA's that I have tried. I could drink a few without being too worn out. I look forward to trying other Founders varieties.
POSITIVE	A - Pours a hazy golden color with a one finger width white head. Some thin lacing sticks around on the glass.   S- Some slight bitter hop aromas with grapefruit and piney notes. I'm getting a more mild IPA aroma off this one. Some delicate flower like aromas.   T- Taste pretty much follows the aroma with a faint bitterness from the hops. Drinks like a more mild Founders IPA. This one is a very nice easy drinking beer.   M- Very light body with a nice refreshing crispness and clean finish. Very nice beer.   O- Very drinkable and great tasting. Founders has not let me down yet with any of there approaches. Cheers Founders !
POSITIVE	Pours opaque in hue with cinnamon head that leaves light mist over top. Smells of bitter chocolate, dark coffee, earth, cinnamon, and bourbon. Tastes of dark chocolate, maple syrup, cappuccino, slight cinnamon. Heavy body but smooth. Delicious and quaffable.
POSITIVE	A- Very dark brown and not transparent at all. Very carbonated, thick, creamy head with a nice lace covering the entire top of the beer.  S- Very malty with notes of chocolate and leather. Smells like someone add a few shots of Jack Daniel's... very intriguing!!  T- Strong Jack taste again but nothing overpowering. Complimented nicely by the heavy chocolate malts. This is exceptional!!  M- Very carbonated, medium bodied, but smooth.  D- Could be a little thicker, I think that it would add to the taste, but this is a really really good beer!! I would drink this every day if I had the opportunity.
NEGATIVE	Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has an amber color with a tiny little head. Smell is of hops, some sweetness. Taste is hop heavy up front, some malts, bitter at the finish and a touch on the bland side. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a somewhat unbalanced and mediocre beer.
POSITIVE	This is indeed quite tasty. The jet black color is very nice not very much light getting through this beer. The head is sticky and light brown. The hops are prominent along with a ton of roasted chocolate flavors and wood in the aroma and taste. The mouthfeel is semi thick, a little oily. The beer overall is really nice.
POSITIVE	Pours a headless, syrupy brown into my Maudite snifter. Smells like toffee, bourbon, and sweet malt. Awesome. Taste is bourbon, caramel, and delicious layers of malt. Definitely on the sweeter side, but the bourbon notes keep it in check. With some time on the bottle this will get even better. Overall an awesome barleywine and one of the best new beers I've had in awhile.
POSITIVE	An interesting beer with an equally interesting name. Vas Deferens pours a lovely deep reddish tinged brown with a nice, slightly tan head that has nice retention. The aroma is sweet and a bit boozy with plenty of dark sugar and fruit notes, chocolate and a bit of spice. The taste is very similar. Fruity, caramel, chocolate and slightly spicy with a bit of herbal hops. It also has a slight sour note to it and some definite orange like character. It is an interesting beer, but really not that compelling. The mouthfeel is medium with a nice finish, and it is of average drinkability for style. It is an interesting beer, but really not that compelling. Still, a well made brew with a name that makes me giggle. That has to be worth something.
NEGATIVE	12 oz bottle poured into a Boulevard Smokestack tulip. Light froth of head recedes quickly and leaves a solid lace around the edge of the surface. A few chunks stick to the glass. Color is a dark golden amber. There are large chunks of sediment floating around. I should have decanted better.  Smell has a sweet woody aroma. The bourbon barrel aging is strong, which seems to be common for Founders beers. There are dark sweet sugars. Taste has a warm alcohol warmth and is a little unbalanced by that. Wheat tries to make a statement, but the bourbon is overwhelming. There's a little smokiness.  Mouthfeel has a great smooth character. Smooth carbonation that finishes with a bite. Overall, I think this is OK. I think I would like to try the wheat wine that's not barrel aged.
NEGATIVE	Poured from tap at Tjs in Paoli into a tulip tasting glass.  A: A light golden color with a one finger white head. Glass lacing is short lived and recedes back into the glass.  S: Wow, bourbon and booze up front with some piney citrus hops and a bit of oak. A deep malt sweetness comes through. Very complex.  T: Booze just slams you in the face with a huge bourbon flavor coupled with some slight oak hints. The hops slide in with a decent amount of citrus and pine. The more I taste, the more I get the pineapple grapefruit hops. A very hefty malt caramel sweetness pokes through to hold up the abv. Finish is dry and burny. This is a very complex beer.  M: Full, coating and burny with alcohol. Wow.  D: Low, a struggle to do anything but sip this baby.  Overall I guess I just don't get the barrel aged IPA thing. This one is so hot with alcohol that it makes it undrinkable in any quantity. I don't think I could finish a pint. Still, the complexity of it is amazing. Just not my bag.
POSITIVE	On tap at Bavarian Lodge served in a 16oz tumbler glass  It poured a clear dark cola color with a nice 3 finger head that lasted several minutes.  I've had a nice handfull of smoked beers in my life and this one smelled the most like how I would want my smoked beers. Notes of bacon and baked beans hit me first. It was a great aroma without much bitterness, roastiness, or astringency that some other had. I knew I had found a winner.  The taste really delivered on that promise. Right away a smooth smokiness overwhelmed me and memories of grilling meats came to my head. A touch of bitterness then came forward but was really dominated by the malt. A little sweet malt flavor matched the smoke to bring back those baked bean flavors. I really enjoyed this beer as the flavor put the smoke first and foremost and didn't leave much of anything else.  The mouthfeel was crisp and on the thin side but I think it complimented the beer well and enhanced drinkability. As with other smoke beers I've had if they are too dominating and full bodied the pint seems to be a challenge about halfway through. This beer was light on the tougne and the smoke didn't leave a harsh aftertaste. My first smoke beer from this well known brewery and I will be seeking out their other offerings.
NEGATIVE	12oz bottle from Wasatch in a recent trade. I think this may be an older vintage as the ABV is listed at 8.7%.   A: Aggressive pour yields a murky brown beer with a slightly cream colored cap that disappears into a ring of bubbles on the edge of the glass and a small island in the middle.  S: Booze, big bourbon profile, lots of malts, never really a great sign when the first thing I notice in a beer is the booze, but it actually is growing on me. Some notes of wood and vanilla, a little char. Nice.   T: Smooth syrupy malts that lend flavors of vanilla and roasted malt, which leads into a great bourbon profile. Honey, vanilla, oak, caramel, slightly astringent alcohol flavor. Man the vanilla note in this really stands out, I love the lingering aftertaste of the vanilla on this. Wow, chocolate creeps in on the back of the vanilla as well. Very sweet beer, but it serves its purpose well as dessert. Delicious.   M: Fairly thick body, very low carbonation, dry, and incredibly smooth. Just enough warming alcohol to know it's there.   D: A little sweet and strong to be a session, but this is a stellar dessert beer. Excellent. Will definitely try and revisit this beer in any way that I can. Great work from Founders, I have yet to be disappointed.  Thanks John!
POSITIVE	Founders Imperial Stout, bottled version, purchased at Whole Foods Bowery, New York.  Appearance: Pours smooth, not too thick as I would expect. Silent and creamy. A one-finger head quickly dissipates, leaving only a small rim around the glass and not a lot of lacing.  Smell: Some booze, wood, coffee, chocolate, cooked cereal (maybe oatmeal?).   Taste: More wood, coffee, chocolate (milk and bitter), some sweetness and the taste of tree branches in the forest at night, some dew and dampness. Beautiful, enticing.  Mouthfeel: Extremely creamy and smooth, pure liquid chocolate, medium body and carbonation, full flavor. Prickly bitterness on the roof of the mouth and dry, chocolaty finish.  Drinkability: High. The 10.5% is not at all evident. So smooth, so delicious, so addictive. I like it better on tap, but the bottled version is still outrageously amazing. This is a sleeper, one of the best Imperial stouts out there people don't know about yet.
POSITIVE	Appearance: Pours a cloudy amber color with a modest head that leaves a few dots around the chalice  Smell: Caramel, raisins and stone fruit  Taste: Opens with a rich caramel flavor that is joined, mid palate, by a rather fruity aspect; after the swallow, the subtle impact of the yeast and spices moves this barleywine in a rather unique direction; some earthy bitterness appears as well, but the age has taken the edge of the hops  Mouthfeel: Full bodied with moderate carbonation  Drinkability: A very nice barleywine that leans English rather than American now that it has aged a bit; the yeast and spices add an intriguing dimension
POSITIVE	I've been searching for this beer for years and actually had a chance to try it last year during Philly Beer Week. It was on tap at the Yards brewery during the Smoke 'Em If You Got 'Em festival. I arrived an hour after the event began and it was already gone. Curses! I heard that this was on at Bierkraft in Brooklyn so I drove there today to pick up a couple of growlers. I love this brewery and this is the only beer they brew that I haven't had yet. I'm very excited to finally get to try it.  Pours a cloudy, dark copper/mahogany color with dark, golden ruby/orange hues when held to a light source and a two finger soapy, light yellowish-beige head that has excellent retention, only slowly fading into a lasting cap. Sporadic chunks of soapy lacing are left behind.   Another amazing smelling beer from Schlenkerla. Lots of smokey toasted malt with hints of campfire, earthy oak, barbecue and bacon. Although the rauch/smoke notes dominate the nose, it is not one dimensional at all. There are hints of earthy oak, caramel malt, bready yeast and faint hops. Of these later characteristics, the oak and caramel are most prevalent. It's a nice change of pace to be able to smell something other than butane in this style of beer. Don't get me wrong I love smoke bombs but the nose on this beer is very complex and unlike any other beer of the style that I've come across before.   Full bodied which is not surprising for a lent beer but I still wasn't expecting the mouthfeel to be so dense. Nice and smokey yet still well balanced by other flavors making it extremely complex and drinkable. Slightly nutty with lots of toasty malt and bready yeast notes contributing to the full body with a surprisingly strong oak presence and some nice crisp hop bitterness. The hop presence was much more prominent that I had expected and it was a very pleasant surprise. Although these other flavors are present, this beer is still dominated by smoked malt. Lots of smokey campfire flavor with hints of bacon, barbecue, charcoal and burnt toast. As in the nose, there are a lot of different elements contributing to the complexity of this beer. In one sip you get smoke, oak, nut, caramel and bitter dry hops all complimenting each other without anything becoming to overpowering, even the smokiness. Incredibly quaffable and absolutely delicious. Highly recommended!
POSITIVE	A = Crazy dark black. About as black and opaque a beer as I've ever seen. One-centimeter, brown head forms slowly and lingers.  S = I am very pleasantly surprised to catch bourbon straight-away with the initial smell. Much more so than the 2009 version, which lacked in both bourbon and coffee charachteristics. Fabulous, beautiful array of bourbon, coffee, chocolate, dark fruits and roasted malt.   T = A lot like the smell. Bourbon, tons of malt (especially Special B), coffee, roast all work in unison to create a fantastic tasting experience.  M = Really thick and luscious, coating the entire surface of the tongue and palate -- just as I like my imperial stouts to be. Smooth and warm light carbonation that works at bringing out all complex aspects of the beer.  D = The easiest drinking 11.2--percent I've ever had. Just fantastic and delicious, and deadly drinkable. This is a young beer at this point, and I can't even imagine how it well it might age out. Seek and destroy this one.
POSITIVE	Pours a deep dark black with very little head. Smell is a complex blend - chocolate covered cherrys (chocolate, cherry and cream), coffee, prune, raisin, vanilla, anise, smoke. Taste follows smell with a robust chocolate and fruity flavor (above mentioned cherry, prune, raisin). Background has vanilla, anise, herbal notes, hints of earth and wood. Nice resiny piney hop flavor in the back end. Slightly noticeable booze. Would have enjoyed a more robust malt presence, or tuned down fruit and herbalness. Full bodied yet smooth, oily and coating, warming, decent carbonation. Very good RIS which sits on the bold and assertive side of complex, some of the malt charachter does get lost in the shuffle.
POSITIVE	Pours a deep golden brown with a huge off-white head that settles into sticky clumps. The head remains through the entire drink and left lots of lacing on the walls of the glass.  The smell is a strong piny hop note, full of oils and spice. There's a nice pungent hop attack to this nose - nothing subtle about it.  Flavor is very similar - it's a hop monster that's for sure! Some citrus notes but primarily flavors of pine and a light floral perfume... Spicy peppery finish really gives this IPA a sharp tang. Rather mild grain notes would be the only complaint here - there's a bit of a sweet malt note but it's pretty well overpowered by the hops. Not a bad thing as the hops are wonderful but just a tad unbalanced.  Mouthfeel is spot on. Medium bodied brew with plenty of carbonation left over after the foamy head. Very mild oily coating on the tongue us cleaned up nicely by the combination of bubbles and hop bitterness. Nice dry finish with lots of hop echoes.  A very drinkable IPA though apparently not widely available at the moment... This was provided by Big Love and seems to be a part of OFallon's experimental bottling. No more experimentation needed - this one is just right!
NEGATIVE	Had on tap at rustico in a goblet/chalice  A - A nice amber brick body with a good amount of white lacing. The body is slightly hazy.  S - The smell has a ton of pine on it. There are stong maly notes that come in on the back end. The smell is strong hot.  T & M & D - The taste is all kinds of malty carmalized sweet sugar. That lasts the whole front and middle of the taste and into the back end of the palate. It is not until the finish that a slight bitter cleanness comes in. The beer is smooth in body and full. The beer packs a significant punch.  O - Worth a try on this one. A big bold beer that demands a sip.  -Cheers
POSITIVE	On draft at Publican in Chicago.  A very stout-like porter. Pours almost black, opaque with just a hint of brown. Nice thick head and the sticky lacing you expect from a fresh draft. Smell is toasted malts and faint hops.   Taste is toasted (almost burnt) malts, coffee and nuts up front then mellow hops. Very silky mouth-feel, almost creamy -- a lot like the Breakfast Stout actually, but just a bit lighter.  Overall, a great, balanced beer. Very similar to their Breakfast Stout, with a less sweet more hoppy taste (which interesting because it has fewer IBUs than the stout). Very drinkable, but just doesn't have the wow factor that the stout does.
POSITIVE	Crystal clear sunshine gold, lots of fizzy carbonation adding to a nice white head. Good lacing.  Sugary cane and Belgium yeast in the aroma. Some spices and coriander fill the taste profile, a nice sipping 7% brew. I could go for more that one easily, a decent brew, not overpowering at any aspect.  Another fresh brew, thanks to my great son, studying overseas in Amsterdam. I was brought this for the unique chance to enjoy.
POSITIVE	Pours cloudy orange with a white head. Very hoppy smell and some hints of the rye in the nose. Great crisp hop flavor with some sweet rye notes. This one has a nice round finish. It says its 70 IBU but I don't believe it. the carbonation was spot on. This is just a great beer.
POSITIVE	Pours a hazy golden orange with lots of little unfiltered floaties. It has a smallish creamy off-white head that quickly went to a thin film and laced the glass.  Its aroma is piney, orange and grapefruity centennial hops. Pretty sweet and citrusy, a little floral.  The flavor is sweet and malty with lots of citrus (grapefruit, lemon, orange) up front. It follows up with a nice bitter finish, a little more subdued than other IPAs. Well balanced, but I personally would like a tad more bitterness. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and smooth and velvety.  Overall, a very fine and drinkable IPA. If I could get this regularly, it would be a standard in my fridge.
POSITIVE	Bottled September 2011, poured into pint glass.   A: Pours golden/copper color, 1 finger white head that quickly dissipates.  S: Intense fresh hop smell, citrus, fruity, and pine.  T: Initial taste very fresh hop/and citrus, finishes with bitter hoppy flavor that is not overpowering.  M: Smooth, light, and crisp body, very refreshing.  O: A very good wet hopped beer, balanced and fresh.
POSITIVE	Craving an imperial stout all throughout an afternoon in San Francisco, I returned home to this little guy sitting in my beer fridge. Pours black with only a tiny head forced out from my 8 inch high pour. With such little head to retain in the first place, this leaves a surprisingly solid amount of lacing. Little dots all over my glass.   The smell is strong even when served cold. Dark chocolate and cold coffee with a wallop of metal.   Taste picks things up. All kinds of coffee flavors, with some vanilla and plummy notes, this could be mistaken for a (port?) barrel-aged Founders Breakfast Stout. Very tasty, smooth, and not overly sweet. Very bitter finish.  Mouthfeel on this is incredible. Medium bodied with stronger carbonation than I'm used to in an IS. It really works on this brew. The aggressive bubbles accentuate the coffee bitterness that is really on display here. Really oily and smooth with a slightly hot finish that rounds out the flavors nicely. Not as boozy as, say, KBS.   Highly drinkable for a 10.5% brew. Would buy again.  Overall, I'm a bit surprised this beer doesn't get talked about more. A very solid imperial stout.
POSITIVE	Served in a wine glass.  A- Pours a dark purple with a 1 finger pink head, and a some lacing.  S- Pick up on a lot of yeast. Raspberries, vino aromas, and abv is presence in nose.  T- Sweet raspberries and yeast, followed by a bitter dark fruit flavor and alcohol. Thought there would be more sour/tartness in the finish but it is relatively non-existent.  M- Full bodied. Definitely a sipper. Almost has more of a creaminess than syrup texture. Has a dry wine finish especially as it warms.  O- A good fruit beer, but I was expecting more. Was expecting more of a sour beer. The yeastiness of the beer makes it a little different and a slow drinker. Glad I tried it, but would not pay the $15 for it again (glad I had this now because I would have bought another if I found one).
POSITIVE	Served in a tulip. Pours a hazy amber with a consistent, half inch, off-white head composed of compressed, tiny bubbles below the surface of the cap. Head exhibits good retention with thick swaths and strands of lacing revealed during the tasting. Nose expresses sweet citrus notes on a toasted malt backbone with the merest suggestion of caramel. Taste is somewhat consistent with nose; however, sweetness is somewhat muted and an even bitterness comes out. Malt profile is a little more flat and earthy (the rye definitely makes itself known here) and finishes with a light, lingering bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium-light (closer to the lighter side of the spectrum) with a lively, semi-sparkling background carbonation. A solid beer with a great balance between malty and hoppy; sweet and bitter.
POSITIVE	12 oz. glass into a chalice  Body is hazy and the color of raspberry iced tea. A thin, almond head recedes to a patch of bubbles and a ring of foam that, while somewhat unimpressive, retains surprisingly well and leaves specks of lacing.   The aroma isn't powerful, as one might expect from an APA, but it is nicely balanced: crisp, citrus/piney hops juxtaposed with sweet, caramel & toffee malts.  Initially spicy, the taste brings some peppery, bitter hops and citrus peel. The maltiness is biscuity and not as sweet as the aroma might suggest. As the beer warms, a touch of grapefruit and pine come through. The mouthfeel is light-medium in thickness, while the body is crisp, refreshing, and finishes with a bitter bite that hangs on for quite some time (kudos for the style). I could drink this Pale Ale both in succession and over time, if it were available. It's got a decent level of complexity, and a good aroma/flavor combo whilst finishing well and delivering just enough hops to keep me happy. Pick up a sixer of it the next time you go camping.
POSITIVE	2009 vintage  Very boozy. Wonderful bourbon aroma. Black as night. Thin head. Not like Founders Breakfast Stout (one of my favorites). This is a Fabulous beer! Better than Bourbon County Stout from Goose Island. I am going to lay this one down in the cellar to see what it does...
POSITIVE	poured into a pint glass  A.   a beautiful dark stout. almost black. a nice frothy head.  S.  out of this world. smells like a frappaccino from Starbucks. a little alcohol smell but mostly coffee with hints of chocolate.  T.  incredible. has the roasted malts taste from a stout but a strong coffee flavor. A bit of bitter chocolate in there as well. the alcohol isn't as strong as you'd think.   m.   not watered down like Guinness. A nice full bodied beer.  D.  could drink this all day. of course i need to be in the mood for a little coffee. the alcohol might sneak up on you if you've had a few however. definitely a beer to sit back and relax with. i think this would be excellent with a little vanilla ice cream (serious). i could definitely see having a couple of these a week. even for "breakfast". too bad its a seasonal brew.
POSITIVE	I had this On tap at the American Flatbread Burlington Hearth. Served in a large pilsner glass it had a large white head that lasted. The brew had a clear straw colored body with ample carbonation showing up in the tiny bubbles.  It had a great grain aroma with a light hop note as well. This had nice and refreshing flavors of grains and hops. Crisp and light in your mouth it went great with the flatbread.  An extremely drinkable pilsner I would gladly have it again
POSITIVE	Wow was I shocked at how good this one was! Poured it into my tulip glass tonight...  A: Pours a very surprising clear gold with a splendid two finger head that laces incredibly. I guess I shouldn't be surprised, as this is a "blonde" maibock.  S: Smell is very upfront and in your face with Pilsner malts, brown sugar and caramel.  T: The taste is phenomenal and very complex. Tons of pale malts, but tons of caramel and brown sugar notes that blend magnificently. Very sweet, but very tasty.  Overall, this is a great beer that I am kicking myself for only picking up one of.
POSITIVE	This amped up version of the much acclaimed Breakfast Stout doesn't live up to its hype. I had a few of these back at the Harvest Party and braved the horrid weather tonight to try it again on a fresher (more sober) palette.  Its on nitro which gives it the typical black body with light creamy tan head which begins huge and settles itself to a small cap above the beer.   Aroma is stronger on the hops and cream with some roasted coffee and chocolate notes coming out as well.   Taste was light and airy which was probably a result from the nitro. Much more chocolatey than the original version yet the coffee flavors were underwhelming at best. I get a bitter quality which I don't know whether that's the hops or coffee elements. More chocolate on the finish.   Alcohol is not nearly as perceptible as one might think but the body can't hold its weight. Decent to good beer but its no Breakfast Stout. Nitro was good for Oatmeal and Frangelico but not for this.
POSITIVE	Appearance: Pours a deep vermillion, with a frothy purple head that leaves a web of lace  Smell: Raspberry syrup with just a hint of Belgian yeast  Taste: Rich raspberry pure, starting out sweet and building in tartness by mid-palate, when some yeast complexity enters the picture; after the swallow, the flavors meld together, with a puckering tartness on the finish  Mouthfeel: Full bodied with moderate carbonation  Overall: Although I might have preferred a bit more tartness or yeasty funk, this is still a very nice example of what can be done with a fruit beer
POSITIVE	Wow, this has been something I've been meaning to explore for quite sometime. The rauchbier style has intrigued me for awhile but nothing could prepare me for what I was about to taste. This pours a clear dark chestnut brown in color with a tan, bubbly head. Attractive lacing down the side of my pint. Aroma of smoked malt with a touch of fruitiness. The nose is also somewhat medicinal. Medium-bodied mouthfeel is very smooth. Unbelievable smoked malt taste that gets even stronger in the finish. I know there's an underlying marzen beer underneath but the smokiness of the beer just dominates throughout. Way, way in the back you can start to pull out some of the caramel and a hop bitterness that attempts to keep things in check.  This is a beer that begs to be consumed with food. It's a most unique style. This would obviously pair well with smoked foods like salmon, BBQ ribs and grilled sausage. The style is probably an acquired taste and I think it takes a few times to "get it". But once you do... wow, it's amazing.
NEGATIVE	The bottle says that the beer has 50 IBUs and is 10.2% abv. Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a cervoise.  Appearance: Dark murky brown with a quarter inch head that fades to nothing.  Smell: The smell is of whiskey and oak with some vanilla.  Taste: The whiskey, oak, and vanilla are present in the taste as well.  Mouthfeel: Full mouthfeel, almost syrupy.  Drinkability: Not something I would want more than a bottle of in one sitting. Definitely a sipping beer.
NEGATIVE	A dirty brown color body with little to no head or lacing, light carbonation . Aroma is of tootsie rools and articificial cherries , sweet with a hint of some kind of malt . Flavor is chocolaty with more of the odd cherry , I find this whole thing to be off and artificial , medium body with a light mouthfeel and an odd aftertaste , I would not call this sessionable or anything like due to the fact that this is just not for me , sorry just not my thing . Nice try though and somewhat interesting.
POSITIVE	A: Another bad pour. Golden with no head.  S: Bad pour made for no scent really.  T: Pretty sweet malt flavor, nice hop bitterness. Well balanced.  M: A bit sticky, crisp, well carbonated.  D: Would drink again but a better pour would be appreciated.
POSITIVE	Appears a transparent copper with a small, beige head that quickly fades out into a mild cap and hearty, velvet collar. Spotty streaks of lacing are left around the glass. Tiny amounts of CO2 bubbles slowly rise to the top. Smell is of hop blasts with consisting notes of floral, herbal, tea leaves, pine sap, grapefruit, dry grapenuts, and caramel malt. Taste is of the mentioned aromas with a doughy, fruity yeastiness really taking control of the flavor and making it more English Ale like with notes of herbal tea and sugar. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, bitter from the yeast and hop selection that carries mostly notes of herbs that collapse on the middle of the tongue in a dry fashion after starting off with a caramel sweetness.
POSITIVE	Poured into a weizen glass, had to pull the bottle away a little to get any head on it. Maybe a finger of foam tops the hazy orange body. A ring of sediment was in the bottle, so I poured that in too. Spindly webs of lace circle the glass. Steady carbonation. Faint banana ester from the yeast when it's first poured. Aroma slides downward after that, mostly papery cardboard. It retains a doughy malt aroma also, which counters the paper products.   Lightly sweet, papery malt again, very faint bitterness toward the end. Aftertaste has some residual apple flavor. It has a fuller mouthfeel than typical Euro lagers, more like a Czech Pilsner. It's not overly alcoholic at all either, which works well. It's somewhat bland, but has a sort of rustic character about it. I would try it again for the price.   This is a fairly new arrival in the area, hopefully the bottle is less than 6-8 months old. Imported by J&B Brands Chicago, IL.
POSITIVE	A: A darkish copper color with a big off-white head.  S: Lots of citrus hops with a bit of pine in there as well. On further smells, the rye comes through.  T: Not as much of the rye as is present in the nose, but it's nicely there the entire time. Hops are good on top of the slightly-sweet malt.  M: Fairly thick and quite smooth.  D: Very drinkable. A solid beer that is very nice on a Fall day with the nice hops and the warming feeling of the slightly-spicy rye.
NEGATIVE	poured from a bottle into a snifter  this beer poured a nice deep chestnut brown with a decent head that dissipated into a ring around the edge of the beer.   the smell is definitely very smokey; the smoked malt comes through very distinctly in the aroma and is reminiscent of a smoked sausage or beef jerky. there is some sweetness in the smell, but it does not come though very strong through the smokiness.  the taste is similar to the smell, but a little more balanced between the smokiness and the sweetness of the malt. there is some malt sweetness initially which gives way to that beach wood smoked flavor that lingers well into the aftertaste. this brewery adheres to the german purty law, so you know that the smokiness is coming straight from the beach wood smoked malts. while this is not a beer that you would crack open to quench your thirst, it would be very enjoyable with a meal of smoked cheese or meat.   the mouth feel is decent. the malty-ness gives this beer a full body and mouth feel. like i said, this beer would go great with a meal of smoked meat or cheese.
POSITIVE	A- Thin mocha colored head atop a dark brown beer. Head retention is null and lacing is minimal.  S- Cola. Dark chocolate.  T- Starts off as a normal porter..., slight chocolate, licorice, dark malts etc. then hits you with subtle smoke. Not overpowering, just very pleasant.  M- Medium to medium/thin. Carbonation is good.  D/O- Every sip made me want another. The look and smell left something to be desired but overall a solid beer from O'Fallon.
NEGATIVE	Thanks to egajdzis for breaking this open...  Appears a hazy, orange toned brown with a small, off white head that fades into a small cap. Spotty lacing is left around the glass. Smell is yeasty, boozy, with notes of peach, nectarines, apricots, caramel, and brown sugar.  Taste echoes the aromas with a standout raisin flavor.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied, fruity, yeasty, boozy, sweet up front with a semi-dry finish.
POSITIVE	Presentation: Poured into a pint glass.   Appearance: Color is a deep amber/bronze. The head is off-white and resulted in 2-3 fingers after an aggressive pour. There was about 1/2" lingering head that hung around in clumps like the residue in a milkshake. Lacing was average.  Smell: Nice hop aroma comes through immediately....grapefruit for sure. The IBU's are around 70 so you get the aroma you would expect. Also some malty sweetness evident as well as a bit of spiciness from the rye.  Taste: Outstanding! The balance is fantastic here. Obvious hop bitterness is balanced against malt and the rye adds a third dimension in taste. Very complex. Delicious! High IBU's balanced against malt & rye....nice.  Mouthfeel: Smooth and slightly chewy. Carbonation is spot on.  Drinkability: This is an outstanding beer in my book. The balance is so well done that these go down too easy. Alcohol is not ever noticed and 1 beer went down in 4-5 gulps. Delicious and drinkable.  Overall: I've already said it. This on is in my top 10 for sure. Very drinkable...great taste...great balance...keeps you coming back. Definitely my top Rye beer. Highly recommended.
POSITIVE	Brought back from the great state of Wisconsin as a single bottle...now I wish I had another.   Pours with almost no head & an off-orange color. Smell is awesome. The taste - hops, hops, hops, but the bitterness is well-masked & not nearly as aggressive as some of my favorites like Hopslam or Furious. The smell is much less subtle, the taste seems a little less 'extreme'.   M&A is good. The alcohol is present when it starts to warm up my tummy, not so much on the tongue. Very smooth. I could see bottles of this disappearing in one sitting without noticing much.   Really, really good IPA. Also my first Founders brew, which has left an excellent impression & an unfulfilled yearning for more. Oh, why did I only buy a single? Why, gods, why!
POSITIVE	11/27/05- Received in a trade with Santoslhalper.  Presentation- 12oz bottle with a bottling date imprinted on the label. Poured into my Duvel tulip.  Appearance- Golden orange colored pour. Full 3/4 inch frothy white head with light lacing along the sides.  Smell- Another tropical fruit scented DIPA! This one has some peaches, apricots, maybe even some banana and papaya. Sweet and sugary as well.  Taste- The first think I noticed as the decent amount of dark malt that I tasted. Was very nice for a change to get a bit more malt than expected. The hops were sugary and fruity. Mostly the common grapefruit taste. Maybe a light touch of a woodsy taste along with it.  Mouthfeel- Not really creamy as much as it was very smooth and mouthcoating. Medium carbonation level.  Drinkability- Quite drinkable. An easy one to quaff. Maybe best suited as an after dinner IPA or with a dessert.
POSITIVE	This was poured from the bottle into a glass mug.  A - deep, dark, clear amber color with a great head and good retention  S - strong 'campfire' like smoked malt aroma  T - initially sweet malt up front and turns strongly smoky as it moves across the tongue; mild noble hop flavors are also noticed with a slight hop finish  M - medium body, moderate carbonation  D - This is a fantastic rauchbier and one of my favorites. However, it is a bit strong to session this one, even if it is so wonderful.
POSITIVE	A: Pours a very bright crimson-amber color with a creamy, tan-colored head. Solid layer of steamed-milk-froth foam lasts for quite a while, and it lays down some nice rings of lace, as well. The color really is quite impressive.  S: Bouquet of citrusy hop aromas meld perfectly with a bold caramel malt presence. Rye isn't much of a player in the nose, but I'm not complaining. This smells like a big, bad beer even though it's only 6.6% ABV.  T&M: Delicious! Full-on grapefruit hop flavors are balanced wonderfully by rich, toasted caramel malt and spiced flavor from the rye. Finish lingers with some tingling spiciness that really makes you anticipate the next sip. Carbonation is light, with a somewhat full mouthfeel that works wonderfully. The more I drink, the better it gets. This truly is a great beer.  D: Delicious flavor, great body, but the higher ABV limits sessionability. Still, this is easily the best rye beer I've ever had, and would rank highly on the IPA scale if it were so classified. Fantastic job by Founders on this one.
POSITIVE	Deep garnet body is topped by a rosy , two finger raspberry stained head. The head works its way back in short order leaving a ring around the snifter. A moderate amount of lacing is left elegantly clinging to the walls of the glass.   The aroma is bright and lively, as macerated raspberries flood the nose. Brewing with fruit can present a challenge to many brewers, even when using fresh product the aroma can appear rather artificial. Founders excels with their use of fruit, pulling out every ounce of fresh berry aroma available. Buried beneath the fruit lies subtle Belgian yeast notes. Slightly peppery, soft phenols meld perfectly into the fruit.   The Flavor displays intensity and restraint. The first sip tastes like a spoonful of homemade raspberry preserves. Strong berry sweetness with an underlying tart finish. The flavor opens up more with warmth, a darker berry sweetness develops and a warming alcohol presence can be felt. While the fruit flavor is dominant the sweetness is held in check, never approaching a cloying level.  Full bodied Belgian ale is very smooth and luscious on the tongue. The carbonation is low allowing the beer to roll elegantly across the tongue. The finish is long and lingering, the succulent raspberry flavor digs deep into the tongue.   Blushing Monk is a damn good beer, I am very happy to see once again. Certainly not an every day drinker, this is one you want to keep on hand for a special occasion. The flavor is rich and decadent, certainly a sipper. Founders delivers far more than a simple fruit beer, even if you are not normally a fan of the style you owe it to yourself to try this one out.
POSITIVE	Thanks to BuckEyeNation  Pours a cloudy brownish color, quick fizzy head, nice carbonation, left some little islands around. The nose is of malts, vanilla, and bourbon. The taste is sweet slightly malty, very much bourbon, nice touch of vanilla. Medium body. Drinkable, quite a different old ale, but very tasty. Highly recommended.
POSITIVE	A 22 ounce bomber bottle poured into my standard shaker glass. The ale appears a clear copper color with about an inch of creamy off white foam. The foam settles to a thin ring in a minute or so. Nose and flavor consist of vanilla, cinnamon, nutmeg, roasted grain, brown sugar, allspice, maybe some ginger. Mostly dominated by spices, not pumpkin. Nice medium to full body and amply carbonated to match the bold spices. Pretty tasty overall.
POSITIVE	Had this beer on New Years eve at the pub on-tap. First time ever having a cask ale. This beer had a strong malt smell and a hint of the 7.7abv. Mouthfeel was great with a roasted chocolate aftertaste and then an alcohol wash. This was a great beer and one of the best Scotch ales I have ever had! After the second glass, the taste reminded me of alot of great dopplebocks with the malty, alcoholy goodness. Though, the warming taste was not overwhelming at all. Too bad this isn't available in a growler!!! IN BA's, get thee to the brewpub and have a glass!!
NEGATIVE	Pours a dark brown with amber highlights when held up to light. Has an half inch of head that fades leaving almost no lacing.  Smells of molasses, citrus (orange/pineapple), caramel, and coffee in there. No alcohol presence.  Taste is mostly citrus up front, sweet caramel/molasses in the middle and towards the end, with a gentle alcohol burn on the end. Very pleasant...want to see what happens in a few months.  Mouthfeel is full and sticky, good for a barleywine.  Drinkability is low, its a sipper for sure. Inviting but only would want to sip this one.
POSITIVE	Pours opaque and deep black with 1-finger dark brown head. Good lacing.  Nose is slightly less aggressive than expected. Chocolate dominates, followed by roasted malt and faint milky sweetness. Licorice presence as well. I like it.   Very creamy on the tongue - almost sweet - with a roasted, very bitter finish. Slight alcohol burn on the exhale. Excellent.   Excellent impy stout. Very easy to sip by the fire pit on a very cold NC night. Another great beer from Founders.
NEGATIVE	12oz bottle courtesy of AGDMainer (thanks Abe!) into a perfect pint.   A - Deep auburn brown, with amber highlights. Not much of a head, even at nearly room temperature, which is maybe to be expected given the high abv. Nice rings of lace on the glass.  S - Very barleywine-ish, with lots of brown sugar and toffee, backed by plenty of piney hops and a little earth. Reminiscent of Bigfoot, but more on the sweet side.   T - Like my first Bigfoot, this took a few sips for me to center myself on it. Bitterness from the hops is more pronounced, and then the usual barleywine flavors come in, with toffee and burnt sugar, then some sweet tobacco and earth. Very nice, definitely one of the better-tasting barleywines I've had. Some heat, but I'm surprised at how little. It's hidden reasonably well.  M - Thick and viscous without being syrupy. Light carbonation that works perfectly in this one.   D - Would be on the low side ordinarily with this high an abv, but the flavors and feel are so good that I have to bump it up a little. I'd reach for anther if I had one.   O - This is a very good beer, with the potential to develop into an outstanding one. I'd love to try this again in a year. I'll be looking for more of this for sure.
POSITIVE	Lightly chilled and poured into a Duvel glass. Glass of cold water on the side to sip from periodically.   Appearance: The beer pours out a dark brown and is almost black in the glass with no light getting through. The creamy brown head recedes quickly to a small ring of foam with a few irregular patches on the surface of the liquid. Sipping initially eaves a small ring of foam with some legs trailing down that become small patches of lacing that cling to the side of the glass. Later on there is still minimal patchy lacing.  Smell: While the aroma has a faint floral character the dominant parts of it are coffee, sweet dark chocolate and dark toffee from the roasted malts.  Taste: The flavor is full and combines sweet chocolate, coffee and bitter dark roasted malt with some unsweetened dark chocolate. There is some sweetness but it never dominates the character of the flavor. It just seems to modulate the bitterness so that it is not too intense.  Mouthfeel: The mouthfeel is medium-bodied and smooth. There is minimal carbonation. By the end of the beer the carbonation only shows as a light soft prickly sensation. The finish is long and is mostly the bitter of the dark roasted malt turning dry and fading away, but it seems to go on a bit too long and have a faint burnt character to it.  Drinkability: This is reasonably drinkable and I could easily have a second but I'd probably not because of the intensity of the flavors. This is one I could return and return to again sometime but there are one or two on my list that are as good as or just a bit higher on my list.
NEGATIVE	Poured into Duck Rabbit snifter.  Pours a layer of tan head. Color is black.  Aroma: Marshmallows and cocoa powder. It has vanilla with a bit of roast malts. Not a lot of bourbon, but I like the nose.   Taste: More marshmallows and vanilla. Very sweet and creamy. Cocoa powder, chocolate, and roasted malts. Again, not a lot of bourbon notes here, but I do like it.   Mouthfeel: Creamy and smooth. Medium to full bodied with a medium amount of carbonation. Ends a bit dry and roasted.  Overall, I like this beer, but the bourbon notes are no where to be found. The flavors are good. Rating this as a stout, it is good. Rating it as a bourbon bal stout, it is not up to par. I like it though.
POSITIVE	Pours a clear yellow color with one inch of white head that had good retention. The head eventually settles to a thin cap. Moderate amount of lacin is left on the glass. I can smell some sweet malt with noticable noble hops. A touch of smoke is also detected. A different flavor than the typical Helles. A little smoke up front before the sweet malt takes over. The hops are a little weak but noticable in the finish. Cereal grains in the aftertaste. Bitterness is low. Light body with abundant carbonation that stops short of being harsh. Low ABV and the unusual flavor component makes this one an interesting drinker.
POSITIVE	Cloudy, dark amber with a golden hue around the edges. Frothy, white, half-inch head that thins to about a quarter inch. Very good lacing as it goes down. Smell is smokey malts, with barbeque, and sausage. As with the nose, smokey malts dominate the taste. Barbeque and sausage, with a little bacon (with a bit of melon) and more smoke at the end. Mouthfeel is crisp, with a medium-light body. Good drinkability on this one. Excellent beer overall.
NEGATIVE	This was a confounding beer that sharply divided the people I tasted it with.  It pours dark with a slight head - it looks more like a dark lager of some sort than a pale ale. It smells strongly of carmelly malt and the flavor follows along - it is just all toffee and caramel. The hops are hard to pick out. The mouthfeel is rather thick and syrupy.  I liked the beer reasonably well - it reminded me of a British pub beer. The others I was with, however, went from nonplused to turned off - one poured out her sample in favor of a traditional American Pale Ale.  Overall, I think this is worth a try - a worthy experiment from Mexico - but not one I will be spending a lot of time with.
NEGATIVE	I can see where many would not like this beer. I enjoy it a lot and yet I don't think I could have more than 1 or 2 at any one time. It is dark ruby in color with a huge smokey aroma. The aroma is the first thing you notice from the time you open the bottle until you have cleaned your glass. It reminds me of a smoked ham and bacon. A friend suggested that it smleed like beef jerky. It is very malty with some caramel sweetness that explodes into smokey taste. It finishes fairly clean and does not linger. I could not tell if there was much hop character or bitterness to the beer because all I get is smoke.
NEGATIVE	Appearance: Pours an essentially black body with a small-sized, light beige head. Thin sheets of lacing on the way down.  Smell: An initial note of not the expected roasted grains, but of fire-charred biscuit tops. Then, there's the coffee conveying roast, along with a bit of sweetish chocolate, booze, and a scant fruitiness.  Taste: Sharply roasted malts, though a fair amount of sugary caramel, some scarce bitter chocolate and burnt biscuits. Noted alcohol early on. Hops convey resiny pine and pithy citrus fruits. Soundly bitter. A bit more sooth chocolate past the mid-point, as well as a hint of soft serve vanilla ice cream. Finishes with a rebound of hard roastiness, more liquor, and touch of burnt almond.  Mouthfeel: Medium-plus body. Medium carbonation.  Overall: As another beer billed as a black barleywine, it's not quite as enjoyable as another, the Jack & Ken's Ale from Sierra Nevada's run of 30th anniversary beers.
POSITIVE	I got interested in light beer again when I got even more health conscious and wanted to augment my weight loss regimen with a lower calorie beer.  Amstel is an excellent choice for those who want to continue drinking beer while attempting to be calorie conscious.  I realize a lot of people do not like this particular beer or light (weak) beers in general, however, you as a consumer need to realize that this beer is attempting to compete in the low calorie arena, and well, there's only so much that can be done there, both in body, mouthfeel, taste, and alcohol content.  Realizing that this beer is not Lucifer or Chimay will go a long way for one to appreciate it's characteristics; I absolutely enjoy the taste of the beer, given it's mildly hoppy, but very beer-like taste and aroma and can almost forget that I'm drinking a light beer, when contrasted to other similar non-light beers (Bud, Miller, etc.)  In the end, I highly recommend this as a choice for those who want to be more sensible in what beer they drink, yet still have a very palateable beer.
POSITIVE	Per the menu, this beer combines the best aspects of English, German & American brewing techniques. It is lagered and Cold Filtered.   The beer was served in a standard pint glass. It is a clear mahogany with minimal head and very nice lacing.   The aroma is slightly medicinal with a bit of herbs and pine.   The taste is slightly bitter and piney. The malts add a nice brown bread quality and the beer seems balanced.   The mouth achieves being both soft yet substantial. This is a very sessionable beer. This is one of their most popular offerings and 3 of the 4 people I saw getting growlers picked this beer.
POSITIVE	Pour: 12oz bottle to tulip glass. One and a half inches of big bubbled off white head cap an amber bodied beer. Mucho resinous spider webs lurk along the glass. Tons of bubbles coming up through the beer make the head's consistency very fluffy as its height diminishes. Finally, excellent lacings remain in its wake.  Nose: A real buzz killer, this one. Aroma of macro lager, malty and weak hops that remind me of a barroom floor. Light notes of grain and floral hints can't salvage it.  Mouth: Good mouthfeel of strong carbonation. Flavor is malty and light, very grainy with excellent malt and bread tastes. Nothing like the smell. Warmth comes up on the exhale making this one an okay drink even for cold weather. After taste is like sweet fresh bread plus a slight bitter hop flavor.
NEGATIVE	Arrives in an Imperial pint glass with just shy of one finger of light tan head. This settles to a thin coating. The beer itself is medium to dark brown with a slight reddish hue. Decent lacing.   Smell: mild caramel malt with a slight metallic undertone.   Taste: slight metallic bite upfront that almost dominates a weak caramel malt backbone. Slight vegetal flavor in the finish.   Mouthfeel: Very low carbonation level. Body is a little thin.   Drinkability: A little disappointingly thin and watery. Certainly not the malt bomb I expected and hoped for.
NEGATIVE	Spicy, floral, grassy smelling fizzy white head. Skunkiness varies on how the beer was stored/conditioned. Super clear looking, crisp bite to it. Goes down easy with a clean bitter aftertaste that makes me want something else. I've just developed a taste for beer with more depth to enjoy a style this light. Skunkiness ain't my cup of tea either.
NEGATIVE	A friend of mine here in Greensboro thinks this beer is the one all be all and shared a bottle with me Sunday night.Poured into a standard pint glass a deep clear amber/bronze with a half finger slight off white head atop,great clarity and hue to the beer.Whoo man the aromas are borderline harsh,just wicked resin with a bit of caramel base but the hop onslaught is wicked in not such a good way.The 168 IBU's is just overkill on the palate,its dry as all get out and bitter to the hilt,wicked pine resin and alcohol make you wanna grab a glass of water and chug it.Iam a full on hophead but this is overkill to the umteenth degree,sorry Brian I told ya I liked it but man that stuff is harsh.
POSITIVE	Pike IPA is a very agreeable ale. It is neither timid nor overpowering. It presents in a very clear, bright gold with a modest malty nose. The taste is clean, sensibly bittered, and satisfying. The mouthfeel is soothing and complete.    A simple, honest beer with maximal quaffability.
POSITIVE	Presentation: Poured form a 500ml brown bottle into a standard pint glass. Label is very traditional and lists the ABV as 8.3%. No freshness date.  Appearance: Pours with 3/4 inch of tan head. this settles slowly, but still sticks around at about 1/4 inch of foam. The beer itself is dark and almost opaque, with slight hints of reddish/brown around the edges.  Smell: Sweet and syrupy malt with noticable alcohol.   Taste: Thick and creamy, with sweet molasses and brown sugar flavors. Slightly smoky. Very little bitterness, but just a hint in the finish.  Mouthfeel: Carbonation is less than average. Great body.  Drinkability: Well, despite the fact that it is May, the weather is cool and this seemed liek a perfect drink for the fall like day. Nice and tasty, a porter in steroids, without being over the top.
POSITIVE	Poured from a 12oz. bottle into a US tumbler pint glass.   A: The beer is a deep gold color with a short foamy white head that fades slowly and leaves a thick lace on the glass.   S: The aroma is of light caramelized malts, honey, lager yeast and some hops.   T: The taste starts out with sweet flavors of honey, caramel and some fruit. Then some bready flavors of malts and lager yeast come in quickly, followed by a mild but complementary hops presence. The after-taste is slightly sweet.  M: Smooth and crisp, medium body, medium carbonation, finish is slightly sticky.   D: Very tasty, goes down quite easily, not very filling, nice kick, very good representation of style, this is a beer that is well-worth drinking for a whole evening.
NEGATIVE	Consumed 2-26 from a pint glass  A - Dark clear soda color. With a low beige head and little lacing. Unremarkable.  S - Bocky-hops smells. Sweet. Like cured meet and smoky toast.  T - Malt flavors dominate the hops and there was no noticeable yeast flavor. It was sadly too hard to describe. The aftertase was stale and bitter.  M - A bit sleek. A bit smooth. Enjoyable goes down easy.  D - Not good or bad. There's not questions it's a bock, but it lacks a lot of distinctiveness. I would drink this if handed to me, but wouldn't reach for it in the store.
POSITIVE	This beer was freakin fantastic!  A: Rich brown nut color. Great head retention and mild lacing.   S: Malty sweet with fruity aroma.  T: Wow, you would not know it was 7%. Completely masked in sweet candi sugared goodness. A great achievement.  M: Stayed sweet on the tongue and didnt burn as mentioned of the abv.  D: Would get a growler of this in a heartbeat!
POSITIVE	This bad boy pours an impenetrable black brown with one of the darkest heads I have ever seen. The head is pretty much the color of a very dark hot chocolate. This is the second beer from this four pack, so I knew to pour it hard and right down the center. With the subdued carbonation it created a pretty modest head that slowly melted into the liquid. The lace that this beer produces is stubborn and clings to the snifter making interesting designs.  The aroma on this beer is incredible. It consists of: fudge, black coffee, bitter cocoa, caramel, molasses, anise, black cherries, bread and a hint of citrus. All of this is set off by a slight alcoholic hotness. This is one of those beers that I enjoy sniffing before every sip.  The flavor is super rich and intense, picking up where the aroma left off. Plenty of roasty coffee character mixed with decadent fudge, bitter cocoa, char, dark fruits, toffee and some prickly citrusy hops. Just like in the aroma there is a bit of heat, but it is kept in check quite well. The coffee and chocolate flavors are amazing in their intensity and richness. This is a great after dinner beer.  The mouthfeel is pretty serious, just like every other aspect of this brew. I would consider it to be full and it has a nice smoothness to it. The low carbonation is spot on with just enough to keep it from getting too heavy on the palate. The finish is laced with roasty malt, sweet molasses and spiky hops.  This is one to savor and for good reason. What this beer lacks in subtlety it makes up for with bold and complex flavors. Every sip you can latch on to a different aspect and be wowed by the skill it must have taken to make a beer like this. When I approached the end of the glass I enjoyed a bit of good quality 60% cocoa chocolate with what was left and this beer made the chocolate taste disappointing.
POSITIVE	I've heard about "angels pissing on your tongue." This angel was loaded on Bald Eagle heads and Faberge eggs.  750mL bottle poured into a Duvel tulip glass on an unusually warm (hot) fall afternoon.  A- So rich. A normal pour created a 1-1/2 finger, dense, brown head. The deep, deep brown body looks nearly black through the middle of the glass. The head falls to a nicely covering, bubbly film. There are great sticky spots left all about the glass.  S- While really cold and in the bottle I got a chocolate and roasted aroma. It really opens up after the pour with a ton of vanilla and Bourbon-like qualities. There's a sweet, brown sugar scent that reminds me of a packet of "Sugar in the Raw." Sugary qualities begin to come out more like maple syrup. Medium-dark roast coffee. Somewhat of a "Coffee Crisp" chocolate bar at points. It's so complex. More semi-sweet chocolate later on. Even raisin-like at times.  T- Like Heaven on the tongue. Semi-bitter chocolate early. Brown or unrefined sugar and maple syrup. There are underlying raisin-like qualities at first. Smooth alcohol, especially in the finish. Vanilla notes I'd associate with a nice Bourbon. A hint of wood. There's the slightest of lingering sweetness. It's all very "dessert-like." I'm picturing a decadent, double chocolate fudge cake. There's coffee in the background. The raisins go away with some warmth leaving all chocolate, vanilla, maple, and some lighter coffee.  M- It's rich and creamy. VERY full bodied. There's some slightly warming alcohol that not harsh, whatsoever. Light carbonation. Velvety.  O- Absolutely no let-down here. While incredibly smooth days after purchase, I'd love to try some with a year or more on it. I'd also like to do this as a nightcap on a chilly evening. While pricy, I feel it's worth every penny. I got to a point with this where I was looking hard for a flaw and the best I've got is slightly poor head retention.
POSITIVE	Founders Porter from City Beverage in Winston Salem, NC. Poured into a 12 oz. brandy snifter.  Appearance: Pours a thick, black, oily-looking body, darker even than most porters, with a half-to-three-fourth-finger tan head of average to perhaps even above-average retention for a porter. Darker than tan, perhaps - more of a cocoa, maybe, solid and creamy-looking. A solid start.  Aroma: Sweet, thick malts, heavily toasted, with faint flourishes of toast, definite coffee, slightly fainter cocoa, a few char-like notes. It's smooth on the whole, pleasant and well-blended.  Taste: Very flavorful. About equal parts coffee and rich, bitter chocolate lend a very decadent latte-esque overtone to this brew, with definite milky notes cutting through a lot of the heavily toasted astringencies. There's also just an absolute metric tonnage of spare toasted malt notes, dark but not black, faintly smoky but not charred, and a light, crisp balancing bitterness and faintly herbal hop flourishes, fading a little bit in the end, though very strong up front. Perfectly stylistically accurate, and very high on the flavor quotient.  Mouthfeel: Wonderfully milky smooth, with a moderate, understated carbonation in a thick body that gives that definite "milkshake" vibe. Unevens a little as it warms and thins out, but this is still a very pleasant feeling beer, not too thick in a cloying way, but plenty thick in a nice, rich, opulent way.  Drinkability: Founders has yet to disappoint me with anything (though they came close with the dry-hopped pale ale), and this one keeps the trend alive. An incredibly rich, sweet porter, though with plenty of balancing bitter astringencies and a slight, pleasant hop presence, this one has practically no alcohol, and as such ranks very high on the drinkability scale. One of my favorite porters to date. Definitely recommended.
POSITIVE	.5L brown bottle, typical of other German beers. Pours out a straw to golden yellow with a lovely one inch head. Tons of bubbles make their way to the top.   Smell is light, sharp and crisp. Slight malt and a very slight trace of hops come through. Taste is kind of what I expected. Grass, malt and something slightly peppery comes through.   Overall, a very drinkaable beer with a light mouthfeel. Easy to drink and lower in alcohol, which is a nice break. I would buy this again but not before trying something new.
NEGATIVE	Pours a bronzed golden color with small but big-bubbled mostly white head.  Aroma has cotton-candy sweetness with some citrus and light caramel thrown in the mix. Flavor has a very strong.almost metallic bitterness and some estery alcohol notes. These two characteristics blow away underling malt of citrusy tones underneath them. Mouthfeel is moderate to light bodied with the alcohol pop being overdone. Aggressively bittered but way over balanced to the bitter side. Drinkability was average do the unbalanced nature of the beer. Expected better from these folks.
POSITIVE	Had this on tap at a Founders event at The Big Hunt in DC. This was the best looking beer of the night. Pours a brown mohagony color with head hues. Great creamy head with lots of retention and lacing. Smell is really odd but not in a bad way. Hard to define but I get yeasty banana, vanilla, some malt, white grapes and faint citric hops. Taste is also very unusual. Dark malts, with a sour note that reminds me of grapes. I also get vanilla and a bitter aftertaste. Body is moderate and alcohol is well-hidden. Carbonation is on the low end and it works well. Drinkability is high. Never had a beer that tasted like this one and I consider that a great thing.
NEGATIVE	765 ml corked and caged bottle with a larger Fat Dog label. The differences between this and regular version is that it's bigger (obviously!)and the big time words "Aged in a Whiskey Barrel" above the dog's body. That is one big dog on the label! It has to be a Mastiff of some sort. It looks like this dog could eat a 7 ft 250 lb male and ask for seconds later. A vintage year on the bottle would have been nice of Stoudt's to do, but they didn't mark the bottle with anything. All I know that this is late 2008 version. How do I know? Well, that's when I bought at the brewery.  Appearance: I poured this barrel aged Stout into my Maudite Snifter. It seemed fitting for this beer. With a loud pop from the cork, out comes a Stout that was black as tar and just as thick as a heavily roasted coffee. It wasn't quite thick as oil, but it was getting there. It had one of those solid black colors where light just bounced off of it. Sitting on top of this black as night liquid was a good 1 inch creamy light tan colored head of foam. This creamy tan colored head of foam had great slow retention that left behind a 1/2 an inch long lasting tan film, spots of lace, and even small streaks of lace. It couldn't decide what to leave behind so it left behind both kinds of lace.  Smell: At first, I didn't care all that much for the aroma. All I got at first was a little dark roasted malts, a hint of dark roasted coffee beans, and a subtle touch of bourbon. It's a different story when this beer is swirled around. When it was swirled around, the first 3 aroma where still there, but enhanced. Besides those three, there was also bitter dark chocolate, a splash of charred oak, a whiff of black cherries, the scent of chocolate covered bananas, and a subtle bitterness at the end. What kind of hop bitterness? I couldn't tell because the hops were too subtle. The bourbon and the oak were not let to run wild and free. Hell, nothing was running wild and free. Every aroma was almost the same size. Well, everything except for the black cherry and hops. You don't get much for those two.  Taste: Barrel Aged Fat Dog started off lightly dry and roasted and then it ends with a big bourbon finish. Let me explain the taste in greater detail. The taste kicked off with dark roasted malts, a drop of roasted coffee beans, a hint of lightly bitter dark chocolate, and a splash of charred oak. That was fine and dandy like sour candy, but it was after the charred oak where the beer got really interesting. It's just too bad that it was at the end of the taste and not at the beginning. This beer finishes up with a big bourbon/bitter combo. The hops weren't getting any play time, so they jumped on the bourbon band wagon and aligned itself with the bourbon. Not the most thick and roasted Barrel Aged Stout out there today. The level of bourbon and oak were just fine, but to me it would have been better if they would have increased the strength of some of the dark roasted flavors. Some of them like the roasted coffee beans were too small of a taste.  Mouthfeel: Despite this beer being an Imperial Stout aged in Whiskey barrels, it was mover over the medium bodied side than the full bodied side. It must have been the lack of effort coming from the dark roasted flavors that caused that. The aftertaste to this Imperial Stout was weak. There wasn't much of anything coming from the aftertaste. The aftertaste was lightly roasted with roasted malts, dried black cherries, a pinch of roasted coffee beans, a hint of dark chocolate, and plenty of bourbon. The bourbon was the only taste that bothered to stick around. It stuck around for a few seconds and then that was the end of this beer.  Drinkability: I went over my past reviews and it seems that I enjoyed the regular Fat Dog on draft than the barrel aged version in a bottle. The regular version was thick and chewy and it tasted like the barrel aged version took away some of roasted flavors and replaced them with a little oak and bourbon. If you can get this beer it's worth a shot, but if you can't, the regular version will do just fine. Just replace some the roasted flavors with a a little oak and bourbon.
POSITIVE	Poured into a tall German beer glass, this beer is opaque black and has a thick white head that retains well. This all makes for a very beautiful drink indeed.  The aroma is full of smokiness, and therefore brings a beechwood fire to mind. There are also some burned notes present.  When it comes to taste, this beer is far less heavy than I had expected, in a good way. There is fair deal of smokiness that goes up to the palate, but there is by no means as much of it as there is in the bouquet. The general taste in the mouth is very mellow like a schwarzbier, and the malty goodness is very present and tasty, with a slight burnt tone in the after taste.  The complex smokiness, the malty sweetness and the, relatively, light lager character creates a wonderful mlange that makes for a very drinkable and moderately complex beer. I imagine that I could easily quaff a couple of pints of this beer, one after another.
POSITIVE	12oz bottled dated 11/21/11.  A: Pours a dark orange, amber color. One finger white frothy head. Excellent lacing retention that sticks to the side of the glass.  S: The hops overpower the senses as soon as the bottle is popped.  T: Very flowery taste upfront with an excellent bitter finish.  M: Medium body with a dry, bitter finish.  O: One of my favorite IPA's when fresh.
POSITIVE	Thanks to my good BA buddy cdkrenz for this generous offering from a brewery I have never had the pleasure to indulge.  A - Poured from the brown bottle into a clear pint glass. No freshness date on the bottle. The body of this brew is a very murky amber color, topped with a gorgeous fluffy one finger tannish head. Head retention is marvelous and it leaves beautiful lacing down the inside of my glass.   S - Not highly aromatic, but I do get a good sense of the citrus hops that surely must abound in this brew.   T & M - A biscuity malt body is accentuated by the hops I could smell in the nose. The hops are both spicy and citric in nature. Medium bodied with a creamy mouthfeel that seems to coat my mouth as I drink this beer. Carbonation seems to be on the very low end, which adds to the creamy nature of this brew.   D - This is a tasty and well crafted IPA...the IBU's must be low because this is certainly not a hop bomb, however, the hop flavoring is exceptional, which actually makes it highly drinkable in my book. Thanks to my good friend cdkrenz for thinking of me and picking up a bottle on his recent trip to Oregon...Beer Advocacy at its best!
POSITIVE	Poured bottle into pint glass.  A: Light brown, clear, slight head.  S: Heavenly...to me! Obviously a smoky filled juggernaut.  T: The first few sips have the smoky, malty notes...I feel like I'm consuming some juicy bacon! Then afterward, the beer settles in nicely with the same richness.  M: Moderate body and carbonation.   D: One of my favorite beers probably because the smokiness aromas and flavors drive me crazy. Overall, the beer makes my mouth water and then settles in quite nicely and pairs well with cheese such as gouda.
POSITIVE	Decent beer, probably depends on where you are in the world and how hot it is while you are there. You may even be willing to say it is the greatest thing on earth depending. I consumed a fair amount of this and other like brews while spending 2 months in West Africa. Honestly I think it is pretty hard to tell Club and Star apart, may depend on how cold the establishment was able to serve the particular beer. Nice gold color, pretty good head, nice aroma (you know it is beer). Neutral but refreshing taste, a bit of skunk. Light body and low price make this very drinkable when you find yourself in that part of the world. Not something I would search for at home.
POSITIVE	The first incounter with this beer was remarkable. The appearance came with a wonderful copper color. The bourbon smell was right on point with taste that was an explosion of bourbon, malts, and hops. The mouth was pretter bitter and had a puckering effect because of the bourbon aging.. Overall it was an excellent experience for a seasonal brew..
POSITIVE	Pours a deep dark brown color with a thick tan head with great lacing. Smells of caramel, toffee, hops, and dark fruits -- figs and maybe plums. Very sweet up front and the hops make it really bitter! Plums in there with some figs and caramel. Lots of depth to the flavor. Medium body with a light carbonation to give it life.  Very nice beer with a lot of potential for cellaring. Great drinkability.
POSITIVE	Pourd into a pint glass. Color is clear dark gold with about an inch of white head. Nice lacing left during the duration. Smells of piney hops. A hop bite up front, ending with a taste of biscuity malt. Pretty well balanced. Mouthfeel is thin and nicely carbonated. A decent beer, but definately not the best APA I've had
POSITIVE	Appearance  This one poured a thick, heavy orange with a brownish tint to the liquid and sported a big, super-puffy off-white head.  Smell  The deep, mature, sharp malts form a rich bouquet. The caramel especially is thick and heavy. The hops are extremely complex; I cant begin to describe them all so wont even try. The citrus is dominant and the pine is sharp but well-blended.  Taste  The malts here sugar up at the taste. They very sweet and offer a nice balance to the gigantic hop profile.  Mouthfeel  This medium to full-bodied triple IPA is very boozy. The bitterness is completely worked out of the mouthfeel.  Drinkability  This was a tasty treat that should never, ever, be bottled in bombers!  Comments  Thanks to the much-respected and highly-regarded BuckeyeNation for tossing this little hop bomb into my trading box. Good triple IPAs are hard to find, but this one certainly lived up to my expectations of this unofficial style.
POSITIVE	A- Medium sized fluffy off white head rises from a copper colored beer. Good retention and nice lacing.  S- Spicy and grassy aromas come through heavy initially. Little oak makes a presence int he nose along with some sweet malt and citrus hops.  T- Citrus and pine kick up front then a spicy earthy presence with a hint of sweet the the hops come back with a nice dry bitter bit.   M- Mostly dry with a nice hop kick, good carbonation makes this a refreshing beer.  Overall this is one of the few rye beers I have had, and I really like it.
POSITIVE	Poured from a bottle into a snifter.   A: Beautiful jet black, just the slightest hints of dark brown coloring on the rims when held up to the light. Head has a nice mocha color to it, starts at 1/4 inch and dies down fast but leaves an awesome lacing. Swirls of small head remain in the center of the glass.   S: Dark Roasted Coffee put up evenly with Oaked Bourbon. Vanilla and sweet Milk Chocolate notes, as well as a kind of baking chocolate smell in there as well.  T: Great Balance. I get three phases, as most great beers have: 1) Coffee and roasty flavors up front. 2) Heavy Bourbon, Oak, Vanilla, and an Alcohol burn.  3) Creamy bitter chocolate finish also with a lingering sweetness as well.  Great mix of Sweet, bitter, and savory flavors. Outstanding.   M: This is my favorite part. It is so creamy and smooth, coats but yet has just enough of a carbonation to it as well.   D: Love it, a great beer, couldnt drink too too much of this at once though.
NEGATIVE	This beer makes sense if you want to get drunk on anything other than cheap wine that you can also drink out of a glass or a mug. It does not represent a good accompaniment to any food, other than, perhaps, a heavily salted dried fish.  It is cloyingly sweet and smells/tastes of burnt rubber. Goes down somewhat easy, though, for its alcohol content. The aftertaste it leaves in one's mouth is quite nasty, however - enough to make you nauseous.  The only quality of this beer that makes it worth trying once is that it captures the spirit of post-Soviet Eastern Europe of the 1990's quite well: rogue, rough, anything-goes, highly alcoholic with the smell of industrial decay (burning factory nearby?).
POSITIVE	Why isnt this beer called Founders Dry-Hopped Pale Ale in stead of Founders Pale Ale? Whats in a name anyways. Pour is mostly hazy but very light amber color. Oops I added the sediment, but not too bad. Good head and decent lacing.  The nose is noticeable for an APA. A citrus nose with a grapefruit hint. Some sweeter lingering malt flavors but hops (duh dry hopping) bring out a hopper essence.  The taste brings more of a balance to malt and hops, although the hops are still noticeably stronger. A good bitterness that leaves a light after thought through the taste. The malt is sweet with a mostly basic two row taste. The finishing hop flavor leaves a light grapefruity taste with a subtle peppery finish.  The body is light and easy to drink with a crisp finish. A better then average APA and borderline IPA (which cant be bad). A nice citrus zing with a peppery finish. But what is in a name?
POSITIVE	Pours a midnight black with very little head, but some lacing is left.  Nose is strong coffee, chocolate, roasted malts.  Taste is coffee, chocolate, some sweet malts and some bitterness on the way down. Nice and smooth, this is one tasty beer.  A very drinkable beer, even considering the ABV, which is well masked.
POSITIVE	I haven't had much to eat tonight, so I'm hoping this meaty doppelbock will fill me up. On to the beer:  This is one of the darker doppelbocks I've set my eyes on. It pours a cola brown and settles in the glass a dark buby brown. The head holds itself well to help put together a magnificent sight. Malty and sweet, cookie dough and raisins in the aroma.   Yum, the first sip was very nice to me with a good mellow flavor. What kind of flavors can I find here? Well, there's raisins, chocolate, and most surprisingly coffee grounds. I would like it even more if the intensity of the flavor was a little stronger. I don't want to put down my glass, but I'll try to resist and let it warm up a little to see if the flavor gets better...eh, not much better. I'm merely nitpicking on this fine beer. I want another of this "meal in a bottle".  Notes: This beer reminded me why I enjoy doppelbocks.
POSITIVE	This bottle came my way from Pwoods. The beer was lightly chilled and served in a flute glass.  Appearance: The beer pours a cranberry juice coloration. The head is thin purplish coloration with no retention. Streaks of foam mark the beers passage from my glass.  Smell: The aroma is a layered tart and sweet raspberry. A bit of lactic yeastyness breaks up the raspberry.  Taste: The beers flavor is a layered combination of tart and sweet raspberry. A bit of belgian / brett yeastyness plays well in the flavor. The bottle says its 13.2%. I wouldnt know because the alcohol is so well incorporated.   Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The mouthfeel is dam near perfect. Its not to full bodied but isnt exactly medium bodied either. The sweetness is kept in check by tartness. This was a pleasure from start to finish. This is what I wished DFH Fort was like.
NEGATIVE	Pale gold topped by white foam that showed no lacing during it's short life. DMS and sulfury hops gave it an unpleasant cooked corn character in the aroma. Balanced towards a thin sweetness with mild hop bitterness. Light body. A pretty standard example of what's wrong with a lot of continental lagers. It certainly doesn't have the life that a good Czech pilsner should have, even though it was recently brought across the pond. Thanks biegaman!
POSITIVE	Appearance: Hazy but clear, amber-colored. The head falls flat a bit quicker than I'd like, but it does leave behind a bit of wispy lace.  Smell: Very citrusy; lemon, grapefruit and a bit of orange. Pretty hop-oriented with little discernable malt presence beyond a hint of honey-like sweetness.  Taste: Pale bready malts appear first, laying the foundation for bold hop flavors of grapefruit and lemon rind. A touch of caramel sweetness appears briefly before being swept away by the bittering hops. The finish reveals a moderate spicy hop smack, nothing too sharp; just right for an easy-drinking IPA.  Mouthfeel: Light-bodied and semi-dry while still maintaining a respectable malt backbone. Excellent balance; any more malt and this would be too sweet for me.
POSITIVE	The first time i had 2010 Nemesis, i thought it was alright, pretty hot and a bit of a sticky chore to drink. This bottle is wonderful though, maybe it's the months of age? maybe it's the cooler weather outside? I don't know, but this has turned into a wonderfully melded Barleywine with lots of luscious layers of sweet maple butter toffee bread, cashews, maple syrup pancakes, Molasses, Vanilla, and ever so light alcohol considering the 12%...really? Thick and chewy, creamy i say, a delight on the palette.  If you have lots of this and want to trade, shoot me a BM.  Chad
POSITIVE	12 oz bottle with "best before July, 04" date on label. Pours an opaque, deep brown, nearly black, color with a short lived tan head. Some webs of sheet lace were left behind. Nose was somewhat subdued, with burnt coffee highlighting a background of smoke, cocoa, and anise. Mouthfeel is creamy, with medium carbonation and a mild bite from the hops. Taste is based on caramel malts and is highlighted by dark roasted coffee, a hint of bittersweet chocolate, some smokiness, and some underlying floral/herbal hops. Finishes with a dry and bitter chocolate aftertaste that lingers for quite a while. A middle of the road porter that is very drinkable with its light body and absence of anything to overwhelm.
NEGATIVE	Pours a vaguely hazy golden blonde colour, topped with a half-finger of short-lived, soapy white head. Some lacing. The cloudiness kind of intrigues me but otherwise nothing looks especially grand about this lager. The smell also provides no evidence that this beer deserves such a boastful adjective in its name - barley malt, maybe some lemony hops and honeyed sweetness. Decent, but not grand.  This is a fairly refreshing beer, but it's like they forgot to put the taste in. Pale grain malts with a twinge of grassy hop bitterness in the finish, which barely lingers for a second. There's some sweetness in the flavour profile but the bitterness is more prominent. Thin and watery, with heavy carbonation. Easy to throw back, and definitely tastier than most adjunct lagers.  It's hard to get excited about this stuff. I didn't pick up many adjunct notes, so I would at least rank this above your average macro lager. Drinkable and kinda refreshing, but not something I'm likely to get again. This one was in the OCB mix pack, and it seems like a pretty boring and questionable inclusion. Trafalgar isn't the most renowned brewery in craft circles but they definitely have more interesting, if not plainly better brews than their Grand Lager.
POSITIVE	Poured a bottle of this into a glass mug. It poured a dark gold body, but no head was present and there was minimal lacing. The smell was malty adn sweet, something I did not really expect and kind had me wondering what my taste buds were about to encounter. The taste of the beer was pretty good but nothing to impressive. Pretty solid malts, but there was a sweet after taste - more like sugar than like honey, which is what I usually associate with Czech Pilsners - that did not really ring true for me. The mouthfeel was a little on the thin side, even for a pilsner. Can you drink this stuff? Definitely and you can drink a lot of it too. The low ABV, the thin mouthfeel and the sweet aftertaste make it overall, easy to drink. Reminds me more of something I'd be drinking during the summer than all year round since it was so light.
NEGATIVE	Better be ready to just sip this beer. Resembles a barleywine too much for me.  A: Caramel-orange thick with a frothy one finger head. Laced into a sudsy path around the rim.  S: Sweet and fruity. Hint of citrus like maybe grapefruit with a splash of red grape.   T: Holy bitterness! This one starts off bitter and ends even more. Hoppy pine and citrus with a sweet honey ending.  M: Thick and creamy. Covers the whole tongue.  D: Just one, I am not a big barley wine fan, even though this is supposed to be a dbl IPA, it doesn't seem like one.
POSITIVE	poured into a Duvel tulip -   A: light straw colored with a sight haze, foamy cream white 1 1/2 finger head with sticky lace S: fresh, citrusy raw hops - really great nose on this beer T: man this is a beer I wish I could drink more often...the hops seem so raw and unhindered, yet there is a sweetness that keeps it light and balanced. Super light malt body allows the grassiness and floral essence of the hops to shine M: almost a numbing analgesia from the hops coats the whole mouth. awesome. D: could run through quite a few of these. an excellent craft.
POSITIVE	A: cloudy golden straw w/orange highlights. nice white head and lacing. S: fresh peaches dominate, with some wheat beer notes underneath. T: lightly sweet bready malt, peaches. has a lightly sourish twang from the peaches and wheat. not too puckerish though. finishes dry and crisp with peach flavor lingering. the peach character is just right in this one, while allowing just enough of the base beer to show through. M: light-bodied, frothy, crisp. a good summer beer. D: one of the better fruit beers i've had, not too sweet, not too sour, not cough syrupy at all. a light bodied refresher and certainly worth a try if you like peaches.  i like this stuff and i'm not afraid to admit it. very well done.
NEGATIVE	The beer pours a slightly murky mud brown. A thin misting of head, which disappears about 1/4 of the way into the glass. Aroma is somewhat roasty and malty, a bit weak, much lighter than i expected. Some mild dark fruit, with lightish caramel and toffee maltiness. Not particularly clean, with some estery notes and some muddy vagueness to the malt. More like a dunkel lager than a doppelbock. My bottle says it's a dunkel lager in the description. Still sort of weak, even for a dunkel. Flavor is mildly roasty, with some caramel malt. Some vague dark fruitiness comes through in the middle, finishing with a steady malt presence. Thin, weakish body, with mild smooth carbonation. A muddy malt profile, not very clean, with a fuzziness to the flavor. More ale-like than anything. A bit bland and uninteresting, not terrible by any means, certainly not worth the $9 I paid for it. It could have been a bad bottle, so I'll give this another shot when i see it again, or try a different year. Mine was the 2001 bottling.
NEGATIVE	Deep amber with rosy tints on the edges, this shows a slight haze and lumpy, rolling hills of a head. Looks like Swiss cheese and leaves plenty of of clumpy lace on a tulip glass.  Smells of caramel and pine with a small peppery presence. The pine fades quickly to an overbearing ogre of caramel.  Since an amber ale with rye is a fairly de rigueur recipe for homebrewers, especially a certain famous "Denny" recipe, this beer suffers in comparison. So many people have done this on a non-commercial level, many with great success, that I'll be heretical in calling this no better than those. A straight line of caramel, rye spiciness, then hop balance. Has the pepper but not quite the oiliness and calvados-like notes that rye can impart. The brick of caramel also tames the rye as well as the purported 60 IBU's. In all, not terribly different from the brewpub amber ale craze of many years back but a little funkified to interest the beer enthusiast.
POSITIVE	Pours mostly amber with a little red,nice little redish copper head that dissipates quickly,no mistake this beer is a rye from the smell and taste malt and rye and nice hop balance,it reminds me of the caraway seed in a loaf of rye bread,not overpowering but wanting another slice,this is an easy drinker and a solid rye
POSITIVE	Presentation: 12oz. green bottle with no "bottled on" or "best before" date; purchased as part of a ten beer sampler pack from the West LA Whole Foods on National and Barrington ($12.99).  Appearance: Pours a crystal clear, golden orange; fine, 1", snow-white head; light to moderate lacing; not much head retention.  Aroma: Predominantly of grassy, floral hops; mild, grainy, malt undercurrent.  Taste: Gentle malt-sweetness upfront; moderate floral, grassy type hop-bitterness in the finish; faint notes of grain and rye throughout. Medium bodied; smooth, crisp mouthfeel.  Notes: Adequate to decent Bohemian pilsener and nothing more.
POSITIVE	Perspicuous pumpkin with burnished amber edges. The pastel orange head is on the small side, so I guess the ABV won the battle against the hop oils. It's thickly creamy and nicely persistent, though, and looks good in contrast to the color of the beer. A modest amount of lace isn't a big surprise.  The nose, while good, isn't as hoppy as I'd hoped it would be. Double IPA smells caramel malty and orange fruity, but I can tell that it won't be a resinous hop bomb. Not a trace of alcohol greets my nose; an amazing feat since the ABV is in the double digits.  The flavor is a member of the caramel malty, non-brilliantly hoppy school of DIPAs. In fact, if blinded, I'd have said 'barleywine' with guesses one, two and three. A prodigious pale and caramel maltiness dominates, providing generous amounts of toffee and butterscotch. The amount of sticky sweetness is just right; any more would be too much and would enter the realm of cloying.  What hoppiness is present is noted as orange fruit and a lingering, slightly puckery bitterness that sneaks in on the finish and counters the malt quite effectively. Better late than never. The flavor is good, it just isn't DIPA good. The alcohol adds rather than detracts. I'm still impressed at the relatively refined nature of this 10.0% beast.  The mouthfeel is well done. It's somewhere in that netherworld between medium and full and is infinitely smooth. I like it more and more as the beer warms. Bubbles provide interest and lift, but don't intrude.  Stoudt's Double IPA is not the stuff of dreams for those hopheads among us, but it is good beer that is best enjoyed cool rather than cold and in sips rather than in gulps. While I'm disappointed that my ever-present 'hop jones' wasn't satisfied, I'm pleased at the beer that Stoudt's has chosen to brew. I'd gratefully add a sixer or two to my cellar if I had access.
NEGATIVE	I thought this to be a rather novel beer; I've had Alaskan Smoked Porter before, and this is definitely smoked to a new extreme. I would recommend it as a beer experience although not as an everyday drinking occasion.  It pours an opaque black with a moderate amount of tan head. Aroma is definitely of smoke, or as my wife (who doesn't know anything about beer) described it, "ham." Taste is also a bit like a smoked meat. Very interesting, but I am not sure that you could call this beer "true-to-style." I'd recommend it, but wouldn't call it a great beer.  I've had this and O'Fallon's pumpkin ale. They are both definitely extreme, but more in the way of curiousities than in a way that I would rank with elite beers. Nonetheless, I'll keep trying what they put out!
POSITIVE	This is my first rauchbier.  Pours a burnt amber. Good head. Holy smoked meat! This has huge beef jerky on the nose. Salty smoked meat goodness. Tastes about the same as it the nose. Wood, smoked meat, cured meat, soy sauce.  This is delicious for the first 6-8oz, then it gets to be a little much. I imagine after having this a few times, you appreciate the flavors more. Maybe I should've picked a tamer rauchbier to be my first
POSITIVE	Picked this up at Hawthorne's Cafe after a Villanova game in the city. Poured into my Troegs pint glass.  Appearance: Finger tall white head rises and recedes to a pretty thick film that lasts the duration of my drinking experience. Real solid rings of lace all the way down. A pale amber/gold in color, lighter than I expected.  Smell: Whoa. Popped the cap and got a strong whiff of hop aroma right away. Poured away from my nose to keep the rest a surprise. Real oily, resinous pine aroma. Some malt in the background, a little bready a little caramel, but mostly a delicious barrage of hops.  Taste: Definitely a strong pine hop presence, as well as citrus, some orange and some grapefruit. Solid malt backbone that keeps everything very balanced. A hop loves paradise.  Mouthfeel: Very oily and resinous from the hops. Not very bitter at all, and just a faint tickle from the carbonation. Medium bodied.  Drinkability: The massive hop presence might limit it slightly, as does the ABV. But overall for what it is, really pretty good.  Great brew...going out to get a case tomorrow!
POSITIVE	Poured into a standard 16oz pint glass. Beer was very light yellow and hazy.  Smell had a great peach aroma.  Taste was very much like a peach soda more then a beer. The peach flavor comes across very good, but it seemed more like a beer miixed with soda  Very fizzy beer, once again strengthing the soda-like opinion.  All in all, I enjoyed this beer, but wouldn't go out of my way for it anytime other then on the hottest days of summer. It would be great for that, or maybe to ween someone from alchopops (malternative bevarages) slowly over to beer.
POSITIVE	A: Mahogany in color. Clear. A measly little white colored head rises to the top, but soon dissipates to nothing.   S: Rye. Rye is quite evident. Spicy hops and pepper.   T: A very noticeable spiciness along with roasted malts and peppery hops resulting in a long, lingering finish.   M: Medium body with medium carbonation. Clean and crisp.   D: Certainly a quality beer and very drinkable. I was expecting a bit more hop character out of this beer, but the rye is front and center on this one. I'm not saying that as a criticism (after all, this is a rye beer), I was just expecting more interplay with a heavy hand of hops. Otherwise, a very good beer.
POSITIVE	12 ounce bottle, "Best by 9/23/07" dating etched onto the neck of the bottle. Pours almost ruby amber, clear, with a few bubbles rising to the top. Medium tan head and leaving spotty and stringy lacing. Malty, nutty nose, with flourishes of leafy, resiny hops. Full flavor, complex brew. Layers of rich malts and then resin laden waves of hoppy dryness. Nice, well worth a try
POSITIVE	A: Poured into a pint, this beer had a lovely loomy blond head that settled to a nice even ring.  S: There are big molassesie roasted malts. Gingerbread with delicious yeast.   T: Tasted of all the anticipated flavors, awesomely, with a full linging body. Brown sweet malts, thick coating, awesomely balanced with appropriate hops.   M: Well bodied beer that asserts it's self down the palate, smooth and rich  D: Satisfies as a strong doppelbock, a fine balance that can definitely lead you to another.
NEGATIVE	It smells like grass, some herbal and spice to the aroma. There was way too much head for a slow pour. It left an awkward film. There is some great lacing on top of hay colored body. There was a slightly reddish hue. The taste is a grainy bitterness with some corn like flavor to the aftertaste. All things considered though it isnt that bad, just odd for the style. The body is thin a and a little bit slick.
POSITIVE	Appears to be dark amber with little head  Citrus, citrus, citrus--Awesome.  Grapefruit right away followed by a semi-sweetness, and followed by a mellow grapefruit bite.  THICK! This one took about an hour to get through. Balance gets even better near end (proablay from temperature and my mouth adjusting to the extreme hop count)  High ABV, and defineately a closer type of beer, but could probably drink 2 of these in a typical evening (over a couple of hours).   Founders has yet to disapoint this guy.
POSITIVE	I have been on a hop kick in my mind, but seem to have been drinking anything but hoppy beer lately so I picked up a 6 pack of this to celebrate Memorial Day sunday. Pours a nice golden amber color with just a little head, less than a finger for me. The aroma was not strong, but of very fresh hops lightly squeezed in your hand. Some mild citrus and pine if you thought about it. Very nice and hoppy in the mouth, and a nice alcohol and citrus burn in your throat as you swallow it. A GOOD burn that is.  This is what I am after in an IPA and Founders as always delivers! There is really nothing I dislike about this IPA AT ALL! Very, very good. I would love to try this on draft, so looks like a road trip will be happening this summer!
POSITIVE	Transcribed from undated notes.  This arrived with a finger-and-a-half of thick, bone-white head with excellent retention. Nose had the now-familiar slightly honey-like sweetness indicative of a quality lager. Color was a gorgeous deep-gold with NE-quality clarity. Mouthfeel was medium with a slight sweetness on the tongue. Finish was solid lager - slightly sweet, slightly dry, simply terrific!  Since my initial review of this beer, I have become much more familiar with lagers and this review more accurately reflects my feeling about this beer. A sixer of it can usually be found in my refrigerator.
POSITIVE	12 oz bottle served in a pint glass.   A: Clear amber with a smallish off-white head. Despite the size, the head has good retention and leaves plenty of sticky lacing.   Aroma: very fruity and a bit floral with hints of cotton candy. Smells like it will be sweet but I suspect not.   T - There is a lot of sweetness here, most noticable when the beer first hits the front of the tongue, but then a good hop hit takes over turning the flavor more piney and much more bitter. I found the bitterness, however, under control, thanks to the malt sweetness. Plenty of flavor, including hints of orange peel and red grapefruit. Presents a nice dynamic palette.   M - Full for style. Smooth but with light carbonation tingle and a very slight roughness from the hops or alcohol.   O - An outstanding IPA, although a single hop variety, even if Centennial hops, is not my ideal formulation.
POSITIVE	Poured from 12 oz bottle into snifter  A- This pours as dark as oil. Even into direct light, it is completely opaque. A nice foamy, dark tan head about 1/2 inch that dissolves rapidly. Good lacing along the glass.   S - mostly smells of chocolate and coffee and is quite pleasant. Also plenty hints of roasted malts.   T - I think I stared at this beer for 10 minutes before I took my first sip. Initial taste is predominately burnt coffee. After taste is bitter and lots of chocolate. Some hints of malts that aren't as noticeable as coffee and chocolate.  M - Oh man is this a thick beverage. Not that I have ever had car oil in my mouth, but if I had to guess I would compare to this. I was actually T-Day stuffed after I finished.  D - Fairly high ABV that limits drinkability although the alcohol is well hidden with the other great flavors. Overall this is an amazing beer from an amazing brewery.
NEGATIVE	A: Pours a deep amber color with a two finger thick, frothy, off white head that slowly dissipates leaving some nice lacing.  S: The smell has an intense hop scent to it with major fruit/citrus notes as well that just burst into the nose.  T: The taste is a little of a let down. Yes there are some serious bitters and a hint of caramel malts, but they aren't very balanced. The bitterness is the only real character in this beer. The fruity/citrusy scent disappears which is a let down. The finish is obviously bitter.  M: Medium bodied with tingly carbonation. The feel is very bitter throughout.  D: The smell of this beer really had me expecting something very good, instead I was a little disappointed. There is just nothing behind this beer, no real flavor and nothing that sets it apart from an average beer. I really like Hoppin' Frog's stouts, but I think, at least for now, I'll stick to them.
NEGATIVE	Appearance: Pours a hazy amber color with a sturdy inch of a head that leaves a few shards behind  Smell: Malt forward, with caramel and nuts backed up by piney hops  Taste: Caramel and nut flavors, up front, with a burgeoning piney character that takes over by mid-palate; after the swallow, the malts return to add more sweetness to the profile while the hops turn a bit metallic  Mouthfeel: Medium to full body with moderate carbonation; a tad sticky  Overall: More malt forward than I like my IPAs, still a well-constructed beer for those who prefer a big malt IPA  Thanks, PretzelCity, for the (h)opportunity
POSITIVE	Bought a variety case of Stoudts and this is the first beer i tried.  Poured from a brown 12oz bottle a nice garnet color with a thick creamy head. lacing disappears quickly.  Light on the aroma side but taste is complex. A nutty caramel flavor with a nice bitter finish.   Very smooth and drinkable. I could enjoy this as a nice session brew.
POSITIVE	Pours cloudy caramel brown. Modest head dissipates quickly to leave a thin sheen.  Smell is suprisingly strong caramel malt. A heavy hop presence that is deep and rich. Very barley wine like. Alcohol is unmistakable, but acts as a pleasant addition.  Taste is a blast of deep resinous piney hop. To a lesser extent there is also citrus and earthy medicinal hop character. Nicely complex. Hints of fruit. Malty sweetness brings a semblance of balance. The high ABV is quite evident and imparts a brandylike quality.   Mouthfeel is full and round. Quite chewy.  A very nice beer here. Big and full flavored. The high ABV is noticable, but works well with the other flavors. The amount of malt can't balance the monstrous hops, but brings this big beer to a pleasantly drinkable level. Very nice.
POSITIVE	Founders Kentucky Breakfast Stout poured into the glass viscous and nearly black in color. The head began as a half finger of reddish brown foam that fell to a thick collar and a wispy cap. The lacing was somewhat spotty, but was still clingy.  The smell was sweet roasted malts, strong coffee, ripe dark fruits, molasses, rum, and spicy alcohol.  The taste was initially espresso, a strong roasted character with moderate bitterness that got lost in the overt peppery and warming alcohol. There were flashes of sweetness throughout balanced against hop bitterness and a moderate dryness in the finish.  The body was thick and heavy, the carbonation was fairly light.   Wow! This is one fine American Double Stout! A couple of these for breakfast would certainly precipitate an early nap, with no complaints from me!
POSITIVE	Pouring this one with a lot of anticipation...completely opaque with a shallow dark tan head that fades fairly quickly to an obstinate ring. Evidence of some effervescence struggling unsuccessfully to keep the froth alive. Smells heavily roasted and dark chocolate. Deep silky smooth texture. First past was predominantly a whiff of dark chocolate with a lingering roast coffee chew on the tongue. As it warms slightly, and the aroma is deeper into the glass, the nose and taste are more of the coffee and oats. Almost a bitter cappuccino towards the end; demands your attention all the way.   Sixpoint Bolshoi had a similar coffee 'take-away but not the same flavor and less intensity... to some degree sweeter. Southern Tier Jah-Va is altogether sweeter. All very good in my book.
POSITIVE	For 80% of the beers tasted this week, I surprisingly find myself going on revisiting beers first encountered almost exactly a year ago. This one is no exception. BB 28/07/2007, served cool in a straight imperial-pint glass.  A: dark caramely brown colour, great clarity; the beige-hued tight and capuccino-froth like beer head is stunning, retaining that 3cm thickness for a good while, leaving uneven traces of laces along the way; gentle streams of very tiny fizziness. Looking great for a non-bottle-conditioned beer. S: very smooth yet focused note of buttery and roasty tinge of chocolate-fudge upfront, chewy in its maltiness, along with a prominent nose of sour-sweet black stone fruits, bitter-sweet roast nuttiness, Fuggles' leafy and earthy hops, and a touch of lively hop resins at the back; a swirl reveals more buttery yeasts and that chewy bits of chocolates, and a faint trace of citric-hops is also at presence. How enjoyable... T: savoury-sweet, sweet coffee-ish, roast-nutty, and chewy brown malts all approach together, on top of a creamy/fluffy bubbly texture... gradually the lightly roasty bitterness of crystal or black malts develops, mixed with flakey Fuggles' hoppy edge (I think) and a faint fruity aroma like plum-jam, turning up on intensity bit by bit and leading towards a profoundly bitter and lingering aftertaste, revealing more bitter dark chocolates' rough texture and more earthy hops in the end... Lovely! M&D: the texture is pretty moderate, benefiting from non-intrusive fizzy flows yet not as creamy and subtle as I'd like it to be; perhaps the rough and bold roasted-malty taste comes at the expense of the texture, yet overall the beer is just balanced and so... enjoyable. The consistant bitterness from the start to the end makes this "Brown Ale" very distinctive from all other "Brown Ales" I've tasted, and I do wonder if this style fits in with this particular beer (vice versa)! Anyhow, I truly enjoy it, and would recommend it to all bitter-ales lovers.
POSITIVE	A- Pours a redish copper color with a nice big fluffy head that stays with the beer the whole time  S- has a rye smell to it with some carmel notes and hints of hops  T- Starts out alittle dry on the tounge with some citrus flavors and then finish's with a nice carmel toffee ending  M-Medium bodied with good carbonation  D-Overall this was a great rye beer.Had good flavors thoughout and was very drinkable. Could enjoy a 6 pack of this anyday!
POSITIVE	Pours a nice slightly clouded orange amber. Nose is perfumed hops, but not a blast to the nose. Nice and even, but firm. Flavor is very nice. Hops are there, but this is no bomb. Just gives a solid hit to the mouth. Lots of pine-y hops. Feel is decent. A bit thinner on the liquid than I would have expected, but a good level of carbonation. Overall very drinkable. I would be down for trying this on tap, or even better, on cask.
NEGATIVE	2010 Vintage  A- Little head. Cloudy/murky copper brown in color. No lacing but leaves nice alcohol legs.  S- Boozy caramel smell. Barleywine-esque.  T- Follows the nose. Booze is all but overwhelming. Hops are there but muted.  M- Thick mouthfeel. Medium to medium-low carbonation.  D/O- Normally I'm a fan of boozy beers but this took it to another level and the rest of the flavors were sort of lost as such. Definitely would try again in the future, perhaps a fresher bottle, but would not go out of my way to seek out.
POSITIVE	Pours a deep nearly black color with dark brown edges. A full burnt tan head rises on top, but settles a bit thin, leaving a swirly galaxy of froth on top and a nice collar. Little lace. In thinking coffee, it actually looks really really good.  Smells like a coffee stout, but a little Christmasy too. Roasted malts, mild light coffee, marshmallow, and burnt wood, cedar, and spice.  Taste has some round roasted malt, full and dry, with a mildly bitter coffee filling in through it. Coffee is strong, but not too much so. Some chocolate. Other flavors accompany that are typical of such a beer, including a slight vegetable taste and a distant woodiness. Leaves a resounding floral background in the coffee aftertaste.  Mouthfeel is interesting. Very oily, thick, and smooth, almost creamy. It's perhaps even thicker than I'd really like.  Drinkability is hindered by body, but not too badly. Drinks smooth and easy, but a little full. Taste is nice, as is smell, but neither stand out to me as being outstanding beyond some of the other well done examples of the style. I like this beer, especially as a coffee beer, but I don't know that I'll find myself craving it like some others. I do like that it's rather palatable without overdone alcohol.
NEGATIVE	Poured a thick, cloudy auburn brown with little or no head to speak of, leaves the faintest little beige ring of sticky lace. Moderate sediment floats about, can be seen with a reddish hue when held to the light. Smells deeply of sweet malt,grain, dark ripened fruits, earthen notes, walnuts. Taste is also sweet and malty, resinous woodiness and nutty. Figs and dates, along with brown sugary alcohol flavor. Leaves a slightly drying aftertaste. Mouthfeel is full bodied with very low levels of carbonation, viscous, syrupy like smoothness. Drinkability is decent, a little too sweet all around, nice level of complexity pairs with a hard to detect 9.3% abv. Not a bad old ale, but I've had better. Recommend trying.
POSITIVE	Had this on tap at Andy's in a pint glass. Pours a hazy golden amber color with about a 1 inch white head.  Aromas of citrusy hops and maybe some hints of grapefruits. Very pleasant nose.  Taste is very citrusy and a little piney. Aftertaste is a little bitter but not too much. Overall its pretty hoppy for an IPA but but the delicious cutrusy hops are worth it.  M & D, This is a medium to full bodied IPA with a good drinkabilty. This almost reminds me a little of DFH 60 minute (draft version) because of the hops but I think this one might be better.
POSITIVE	Pouring a cellar temp bottle into a snifter. The beer pours a jet black hue with creamy tan head foaming up several CMs with a gentle pour. The aroma is some coffee bean and roasted malt but a fairly strong pine and grassy hops. Nice complex nose on this one! First sip reveals a average to thick body and gentle yet slightly tingly carbonation. Flavor is roasted malt and coffee bean again maybe some brown sugar but some slightly bitter hops come through on the finish with a little pine resin stickiness. The ABV is well hidden and the beer is easy to drink because of this fact.  Quite a nice mix that I would buy again if I saw in a store.
POSITIVE	Pours with a big pillowy white head that sticks around and leaves lots of lacing. Smells wonderfully of grapefruit, hemp and pine notes with some herbal and alcohol notes.  The taste has a good pine and hemp hop balance with the grapefruit notes following. With all this hop flavoring the back is not overly bitter. This is a great beer for a hop fix, interesting flavors.
NEGATIVE	Crystal clear brass colored pour. NO head and, understandably, no lace. The liquor looks great, but there are no bubbles coming up the glass.  Mild lighter pale malt aromas. No notable hop.  This is a surprisingly dry and hoppy beer for the style. It does have the crispness of well-made lager. Thinner body with high carbonation may be the only detraction. Good pale malt flavors.  Other than the body and the appearance, this is a nice marzen. The flavor is good with interesting differences that give this beer character.
POSITIVE	On tap at Capone's last night.  The beer pours an orange amber color with good head retention and lacing. On the nose, it's quickly apparent this beer will be pretty sweet, as I get noticeable vanilla, brown sugar, light chocolate and even something of a Hawaiian punch flavor. The flavor profile replicates the nose, but is a bit more interesting and enjoyable I thought. I get something of a red candy apple flavor, along with cherry vanilla, bourbon and more punch. Mouthfeel is pretty full, and the alcohol is definitely noticeable. While not hot, the beer is almost cloying it's so sweet, and that makes it taste a bit heavy on the palate. I'm sure the 10.8% abv. has something to do with that as well.  An impressive beer, no doubt, but it's hard to imagine ever drinking more than a very small glass of it.
POSITIVE	After hearing about this brew for a couple of years and never being able to find it, I picked up a fresh sixer at the local Binny's...  A terrific blend of hops and dark roasted malts present in the aroma... This is pungent and powerful... Hints of cocoa and chocolate... This is amazing...  A smooth delicious flavor experience present here with those dark roasted malts... the piney hops.... the vanilla beans... the tinges of booze... An amazing beer for the style... Founders nailed this one... Easily one of the best examples of the style...  Finally get to try this one and I'm not disappointed at all.. Just an amazing beer...A truly top notch porter here... World class brew... I loved every minute of this...
POSITIVE	As a former Midwesterner, I've had my share of Founders. Everything they brew is amazing. Even when I moved to Seattle -- one of the great beer spots in the US -- I missed it. Breakfast Stout is a big reason why. And now I have my hands on it again.  I won't go beer nerd on you. I will just tell you this beer is outstanding. It's exactly what it says it is: a Double Chocolate Coffee Oatmeal Stout. And it's perfect. Not too much of anything. Easily the best stout I've ever had. It's just as good in the bottle as I remember it from the source.  Stout lovers, get this beer... at any cost.
POSITIVE	A very dark beer, black with a hint of brown, seems clear. The head is light beige and leaves rather much lacing.  The smell is mostly burnt moist wood, some dark roasted coffee and a hint of stable and earth.  A sweet tone at first, from dark syrup and dark bread. A hint of coffee and smoked sausage.  The liquid is soft, mild carbonation and overall smoth.  Something to drink by the fire!
POSITIVE	Got this from a trade with heytathanks heyta!  2011 12oz bottle into a Jester King snifter  I did this review as a side-by-side tasting with an 09 BCBS  A  Black as night with an oily film on top. Only sign of carbonation is the tiniest ring of bubbles along the outside of the glass. A vigorous swirl brings a bit of life to the head.  S  Chocolate cream pie served with Irish coffee and a freshly rolled unlit cigarette on the side of the plate. Nice!  T  Bittersweet chocolate is dominant. Im so glad this isnt yet another too sweet chocolate stout. The coffee and tobacco shows up long enough to wave hello before giving way to the most excellent bourbon and oak. Not getting as much vanilla from the oak as I usually find with other barrel aged beers. Possibly the most balanced -bal beer I've ever consumed.  Hang on, I tasted this so many times that I need to get more to finish the review.  M - Not a surprise, but there isnt much carbonation to speak of. Cant believe how smooth this is though. Not as oily as I expected based on the appearance, which was nice. The bourbon really comes out in the finish but isnt even close to being too hotand this is a relatively fresh one.  O  I poured myself appx 4oz to do this review and had to go back for seconds before I was finished. So much going on with this one. Not sure if I will end up preferring this one fresh or with some age on it, but Ive got a second bottle so Ill find out eventually. Really loved it!
POSITIVE	Appearance is honey/copper in color with brillant clarity. 2 Finger head with respectable retention and lacing. Smell is mild hop aromas for a true APA, but pleasant mellow floral citurs hop notes. Some sweet caramel malt is in the nose also. Tastes as it smells, and seems very similiar to a lighter more mellow version of Sierra Nevada Pale Ale. If you like SNPA, you may like this one, if not, you won't. Light-medium body, medium carbonation, bitter and sweet dance on finish. Drinkability is good for the price as a "mellow and semi balanced APA".
POSITIVE	12oz into a Founders Tulip. Bottled 11/20/09.   Pours dark as night with a half finger mocha head. Looks decadent.   Big and roasty nose. Lots of dark chocolate. Smells delicious.   Taste is just as big as the nose. Huge dark chocolate notes take center stage. A touch of heat on the finish.   Rich and velvety. Dead on.   This is a wonderful RIS. It fits right in with Founders stellar stout lineup.
POSITIVE	pours into my glass with a nice tan 3/4" head.it's not as dark as some porters.benchwarmer has a reddish hue to it.decent lacing on the sides of my glass.  smell is of sweet chocolate & caramel almost desert like.  the taste is sweet with the caramel flavor coming through.almost coffee like with a rich taste.its kinda hard to pinpoint the taste exactly for me.  mouthfeel is smooth with perfect carbonation for a porter.  its much more drinkable than some heavy porters ive drank in the past.it has good alcohol content which is present after the first couple sips.not too much alcohol though.i like this porter much more than others ive tried in the past.this would be a nice winter beer to drink while ice fishing with a good friend or after sled riding with the family.
POSITIVE	Tasting at Fries Cafe. Thanks for putting this together so the masses could try this one.  4oz. tasting  Jet black with no hues visible. Thin tan head than lingers.  Nose has cocoa, vanilla, and roasted notes.  My mouth was watering as I waited to sip. I was not let down. Super smooth. I mean silky smooth with enough mouthfeel to coat the coat on my tongue. Maple up front that leads into the bourbon notes. Plenty of roasted malt characters to keep it honest and a spice that runs throughout. There was a milk chocolate sweetness without being cloying. More vanilla and some raisin/prune notes that remind you it's imperial. Simply delicious and once the 4oz was gone I wanted more.  So thankful to have tried this. I'd love to set a bottle away and try it after a year or two. Draft would be great as well. I'm not advocating the stealing of someone else's bottle but this is a must try.
POSITIVE	Light beige head that was slow to disipate & clung somewhat. Color is golden orange. Great fresh smell, bordering on an IPA but with a bit more malt. Taste is very well balanced. The mild malt sweetness reminds me of an English brown only it finishes w/ a pleasant semi-sweet slightly bitter hop finish that lingers just enough. A little thin but w/ adequate carbination. It's not really complex but I don't think beers always need to be. This really is a great simple solid beer and under a buck a bottle at that. I'm definitely gonna get this one again.
POSITIVE	Poured a very deep black with a very nice one and half finger head, good retention that settled into a nice collar with moderate lacing.  Aroma of dark roasted coffee, dark chocolate and malt.  Taste started a little bitter with dark roasted coffee, dark roasted malt and a hint of hops, then there was a very nice counter of chocolate vanilla sweetness.  Medium to full body with moderate carbonation. Starts out strong with a nice smooth creamy finish.  This is a very nice stout and I look forward to future brews from Pike Street.
POSITIVE	I passes on this beer a few times when home last year but this year I grabbed a couple up and actually I am glad I did.A nice deep red pour with a tight thinner but well formed pink head leaving spotty lace around the pint glass,tart "real" raspberry aromas along with an underlying toastiness, very appetizing.The use of all natural fruit makes this beer its sweet and tart and very juicy,what can you say its just damn good.Iam the first to say I shy away from these beers but this is a gem of a fruit beer no doubt.
POSITIVE	Just purchased today from Sam's Wine & Spirits in Chicago. Ended up chatting with Brian the beer guy there, who gave me his impressions of the beer -- which helped me decide to purchase it.   I must admit that I'm biased when it comes to this beer. Mint in any form is probably my favorite flavor. I joke that I have some sort of deficiency that accounts for my passion for it. Anyhow, I enjoyed this beer at a slightly warmer than usual temperature -- just a couple degrees cooler than room temp. The pour into an oversized Coke glass (hey, it was either that or a blue pilsner glass!) yielded a sizeable, creamy head, which barely fit into the trademark Coke swell. Color was a lovely dark brown, so inviting with the creamy, spicy, minty nose. However, it fought at first for the beer smell, earning it that 3.5. That combination of cinnamon, clove, and mint isn't for everyone, but it is for me. Brings to mind a favorite drink: a shot of peppermint syrup, shot of cinnamon, seltzer, and ice. Oh so good. The customary holiday spice flavor followed for such a seasonal brew -- the aforementioned cinnamon and clove tickled my nose, but the mint floated over all of it. Got a better sense of the cooling properties of the mint after I fridged it for a little bit. Other than that, I picked up some tasty, bready undertones and some malty goodness. My mint-loving roommate gladly finished off the last couple ounces and said she'd have her own later tonight.   This'll taste better, I'm sure, with more of chill on it; I look forward to experiencing that. A unique offering to the customary holiday beer rollout.
POSITIVE	Sharp malty nose. Gold colored with lots of tiny bubbles. Nice fluffy white head. Smooth solid mouth especially for a lager. Quite an even handed malty earthy taste. Slight marshmello sweetness to the finish. A very good lager. The beer is solid and well crafted. A great lager for the fall months.. malty, smooth, and good lookin'... It won't knock your socks off.. but it will give ya a smile.
NEGATIVE	A: Pour is pale amber with a rather small white creamy head. Slow dissipation leaves decent lacings.  S: Sweet malt with a hint of corn. Grassy and a bit grainy. Where are the hops???  T: Sweet caramell malt, slightly roasted. Bitter hops and some faint citric notes. Actually pretty nice flavours, but man they are mild.  M: Long bitter aftertaste. Body is light and carbonation medium.   O: Well, weak smell, weak taste (eventhough there was nice parts in the taste) and rather watery. The only good thing was the aftertaste. Since I didn't pay that much for this can - you'll get what you pay for!
POSITIVE	Served this 750 mL bottle in a becher. 2011 vintage. There was a ggod sized head of deep pink which left a film throughout. The body was deep garnet.   The smell was raspberries. Maybe some Belgian yeast mustiness after spending some time with this one.   The taste was raspberry Italian soda. Creamy, sweet fruitiness with a tart finish. Extremely well hidden alcohol. Intense raspberry but just short of cloying. A lovely dessert to share.  Mouthfeel was medium to full bodied. Creamy with a fine, modest carbonation. I would recommend this one again and again.
NEGATIVE	This would go good with wet scrambled eggs, if it were solid.   The Chernobyl of beers, KBS' burnt toast and burnt marshmallow flavors are almost too difficult to digest. While I've heard some go so far as to pour this over ice cream, I would only do that if I hated ice cream--and myself.   The bitterness of its chocolate and espresso-like foundation is perhaps the most intense darkness I've yet experienced with beer. There is nothing to mitigate it. No surprise sweetness, no sticky molasses, no fruit, no bright hops. It is darkness. It tastes like the color black would taste if black hated itself.   I'm remiss that Founders--perhaps the most consistently impressive brewery I've had a chance to try--covered up so much of its brewing efforts with the most charred oak on the planet, but I don't blame them for taking this chance. It is likely a beer I will appreciate more in the Midwestern fall, especially after its flavors have mellowed and some more of its cocoa richness comes out. It is dense, challenging, and provocative.   ...maybe if we put the ice cream over pancakes, next to some link pork sausage, and Irish soda bread...  Relax, relax. ng
POSITIVE	been about a year since I reviewed this & happened across a fresh shipment, so here goes:   Pours rich ruby red to light mahogany with a 4 fingers tan puffy head. Good lacing & okay head retnetion  S: Slight malt & molasses notes  T: Rich malt, a slight alcohol & caramel burn up front. Shades of oakyness & toffee co-mingle with breadyness. Slight vanilla notes also follow. Some date & brown sugar profile. Rich dry, woody& fruitty finish  MF: Rich, full bodied, with perfect carbonation & superb balance. Some prickleyness keeps it from perfection  Wow, drinks too easy! More impessed with this the 2nd time around. More what I remeber it tasting like in d'land! As far as dopplebocks go, this one of the most sessionable with a great drinkabilty & flavor to match
NEGATIVE	Very dark porter with ruby hues. Almost no head but it did have nice lacing.  It smelled like burnt cereal and chocolate, like most good porters, only the smell was really faint and almost soapy. It tasted pretty good, but not very strong, with strong essences of coffee and chocolate. Nice flavor.  If I had one complaint with this beer it was its thin, unsatisfying body. It was like I was drinking Bud Light. Its body made it hard to drink.
NEGATIVE	12 oz. bottle poured into a tulip glass.  Appearance-Pale to medium gold, slight haze. Moderate fluffy white head with moderately good retention.  Aroma-Fresh, spicy green hop aromas, with lighter notes of citrus. Grainy malt edge with hints of breadiness. Good balance of hops and malt here, but after a few minutes the hop aromas begin to dissipate, and the malt aroma takes over.  Flavor-Balance is towards hops. Grainy malt and bread dough make an appearance, but are washes away by spicy, green, lemony hop flavors and moderately high hop bitterness. Slightly malty sweet up front, but the finish is dry from the hop bitterness, and slight lemon and grain flavors linger on into the aftertaste with almost a light mineral tang.  Mouthfeel-Medium body, with moderately high carbonation.   Certainly a solid pale ale, but it doesn't really stand out from the pack. Strikes me as just kinda meh.
POSITIVE	Poured a nice slightly off-white head over an orange-amber colored body. Smells almost fruity, with light hints of malt and hops. Tastes of pale malt with subtle herbiness from the hops, then finishes dry with a bit more bitterness. Smooth mouthfeel, and good drinkability. Overall it's pretty good if not overwhelming, and it seems like it'd probably be a good session beer.
POSITIVE	Poured a dark red-orange with a thin tan head. The aroma is sweet, honey, earthy, with an array of citrus hop profiles. The taste is fruity steady and smooth starting malty sweet candy, cooked caramel, and a light oily hop bitter feel without being overly "hopped up". This is one straight forward, session quality pale ale. If it was sold in bottles I'd have this in the fridge all year round.
POSITIVE	When I heard about Paul Theakston and Black Sheep it really pricked my imagination but never really lived up to any expectations  till now.  A half decent best bitter (both on cask and bottle) and a passable brown ale, nothing that screamed Yorkshire beer at its best.  Golden sheep addresses the balance a bit though.  A foamy nicely carbonated pint of more ale than ale looking amber with a nice thick white head that clings.  A zesty, citrus like zing of bitterness both in aroma and taste, tasty in its hoppiness with bitter notes that carry through to the aftertaste but still easy drinking.   Hope to see it on cask at some point, reet good beer.  But please if you want to go back to more traditional ways  give us a bottle conditioned beer.
POSITIVE	From a 500 ml. brown bottle with no freshness date to be found. Made a very good appearance, poured a ruby hued dark roasted coffee brown with a large foamy, almost creamy, pale tan head with good retention and a sticky ringed lacing. Had a sweet roasted malt aroma, a smoky, charcoal caramel with whiffs of sweet alcohol and ripe dark fruits. Good carbonation and a creamy medium bodied mouth feel, good, easy drinkability. Taste was a delicious smoky sweet caramel with a mellow dark fruity bite in the middle, a sweet alcoholic presence on the tongue and a dry sweet charcoal finish. At times, while sipping this porter, I swear I could feel sugar granules passing over my tongue. A very tasty Baltic Porter, a must try, my favorite from Okocim.
POSITIVE	My first official review. Just received this 2011 vintage of Founders KBS today; paid $8.99 per single 12oz. After tax its $40 a four pack! Better be worth the hype.  A- Pours a very thick black with a slight brown head that doesn't stick around long at all.   S- The first scent I pick up is a bourbon and "boozy" smell, followed by chocolate. Wow, its as if I'm smelling a chocolate liqueur with a strong bourbon note!   T- Okay, not as boozy as I expected from the smell but the bourbon flavor has a strong presence. Following the bourbon I taste cocoa or dark chocolate. I'm finding it hard to break past the dominant bourbon flavor (maybe this mellows with age??). The closer to the bottom of my glass and the warmer it gets I can pick out some vanilla notes. Isn't this suppose to be brewed with coffee?? If so, it's a minority in this pool of bourbon chocolate.   M- Full Body, light carbonation, and goes down very smooth for a beer with an abv of 11.2% You wouldn't guess by the smell but the alcohol stays pretty well hidden throughout.   O- Considering the abv this is very drinkable and very smooth. I can't say I'm a huge fan of the bourbon flavor but if I was this would be the perfect brew! I'm very glad I came across this one; just not too happy about the price I paid for it ( $40 a 4 pack!?) I highly recommend this to any bourbon barrel-aged stout lovers, still a must try even if not. Can't wait to age and compare this one!
POSITIVE	Picked this up a week or two back since I've never had it before and I've heard good things about this beer. The few times I've been to Stoudt's in Adamstown, I've had a blast. More importantly, the good times and love of beer that I enjoyed there can also be found in this beer. There's no need to reach for something from the west coast to enjoy this style - it's all right in this bottle!     I didn't get as much head out of this as some other reviewers did, but it was there...unlike the lacing. The hue was crisp, radiant, and a nice dark amber. Even better was the mouthfeel, in that it's amazingly balanced for a hoppy beer. The notes of grapefruit and pine are pretty sfrong up-front, but they give way to a backbone of caramel and molasses with a leathery undertone. Yes, this packs a hop wallop but it's a persistent feel, not one that's overpowering. I have no idea how they got this to be so hoppy and complex at the same time, but it works!   This is one of the best beers I've ever had at disguising the ABV%. I'm nearly through my glass and I had no idea that it was 10.00%, since I can't taste or feel any of the alcohol at all. I'll never give up the West Coast hopbombs that I love, but this beer can keep up with the best of them and manage to taste thick while looking thin and balanced. Props to Stoudt's for representing the East Coast well with this offering...
POSITIVE	Bottle courtesy of mikesgroove and opened up at Pliny the Younger release day (2/5/10).  A: The pour is a thick and black with no head to speak of.  S: A great nose on this beer. A fair amount of whiskey, but nice notes of vanilla, graham cracker, chocolate, roasted malt and molasses. All things I enjoy smelling in a -bal aged stout.  T: While the nose was quite good, the flavor is only "good". Milk chocolate and whiskey are the first two flavors I pick up, followed by some vanilla and char.  M: I really enjoyed the creamy, viscous texture this beer has on the tongue. While there's not much in carbonation, the beer avoids being too syrupy.  D: Certainly not a beer to sit down and drink a bomber of, but always an enjoyable experience, but perhaps a touch too sweet.
POSITIVE	Very little carbonation, looks like motor oil, very dark and thick.   The smell just from the bottle was amazing, very obvious chocolate, pretty "yummy" aroma. The aroma on this is amazing, just excellent.  Woah.... mouthfeel is great, flavor is coffee and chocolate. Melds together very well. There is a nice creaminess in this which effects the taste and mouthfeel, very nice.  Finish is nice, lasts a pretty good amount of time and is quite tasty.   If you like Russian Imperial Stouts you will not be disappointed with this.
POSITIVE	Sampled on tap at the Brewgrass festival in Asheville, North Carolina. Consumed on 09/20/2008 and reviewed from notes taken at the time.  What can I really say about this pout, it was a damn pumpkin! Rich orange color was an absolute treat to look at.  Some light haze and cloudiness to it, enough to make it look a bit thicker then I thought it would. A nice one inch head of white and fizzy foam came up over the top and settled down nicely into the glass leaving a good amount of side glass lace to mix around with the carbonation that could be seen streaking up.  The aroma was about as rich in pumpkin spice as you could possibly get. Huge notes of spices that just come whiffing up to the surface. This was an enormously good smelling beer. I swear if you could bottle the fall season, it would come close to this I am sure. The flavor was more of the same, rich in every sense of the word. Huge notes here of all spice, pumpkin, and hints of earthy grains. Tingling the tongue as it went down it was like a piece of pumpkin pie, which is about all that can be said. Delicately light Mouthfeel was well carbonated and not too thin or anything that would be anything less then wonderful. Easy to sip as the flavor was far too rich to be putting this one down in too great of numbers.  Overall though this has to be one of the best pumpkin ales I have ever had, hands down. Rich and decadent, smooth and deliciously. Probably the best beer that Catawba makes, well next to Coconut. Go find this one this fall season for sure.
POSITIVE	Pike Kilt Lifter Scotch Style Ale is thin, watery, and metallic-sweet.  It poured dark orangy-copper with a short fleeting tan head. It left a crystal clear glass. The smell and flavor had a nondescript syrupy sweetness with a metallic aftertaste. The feel was as slippery and lasting as water, although it also was as easy to drink and thirst-quenching as water.  Pike Kilt Lifter has no distinguishing characteristic; nothing to excite the taste buds or palate; nothing to remember; and no reason to have more than once.
POSITIVE	Color is very red and clear. One half finger of head quickly dies down to lacing. Smell is all rye and citrus hops. The taste is an excellent blend of of rye and hops that create a complex flavor that is a pleasure to drink.   The mouthfeel and drinkability is such that you could sip and enjoy it or pound it on a hot summer day
NEGATIVE	A - Clear golden copper with a finger of frothy tan-white head forming atop. The head hangs around for quite some time leaving behind some nice lacing.  S - Aroma is dominated by fruity esters and some citrus. There is a bit of yeast mixed in as well along with some spices and sweet malt. A bit all over the place.  D - Starts off fairly bland with a bit of sweet malt and coriander. Through the middle, light citrus flavors and a bit of yeast flavor come through. The finish is a mix of sweet malt, citrus, and a bit of yeast that does not linger for long. Pretty bland.  M - Light bodied with moderate-light carbonation. Smooth, but overall very thin and watery.  D - Very drinkable. The flavors were far to subtle and weak throughout this beer. The mouthfeel is also quite weak with a very thin and watery consistency.
NEGATIVE	I bought this one randomly at the ol' liquor store wanting to try something different from all the other cheap beer I usually am known for buying...a good choice this one was. Smell from the bottle was skunky; sort of reminded me of a Heineken. After I poured it into a glass however, the skunky smell went away. The appearance is a pretty gold color. Taste didn't appeal to me at first, but after a few sips I got used to the malty, grassy type of flavor it has and I enjoyed it. Very drinkable especially as you drink more of it.
POSITIVE	This beer is truly outstanding. It is somewhat light in flavor and flavored with coffee and smokiness. Delicious.  Appearance is an inky dark with a fairly minimal dark head. Aroma is of coffee. Coffee notes permeate the taste along with a taste reminiscent of a Rauschbier. This beer feels good in the mouth and is wonderfully drinkable.
POSITIVE	22 oz bottle into a pint glass.   Pours black with some garnet highlights around the bottom and a big +1 finger of light tan head. Retains well with a nice looking creamy layer that leaves a nice latticework of lacing behind. The aroma is mostly dominated by the IPA character, with hop bitterness and citrus notes leading the charge but a fair amount of chocolate and roasted malts still make their presence known as well.   The taste is a great mix of both. First up is the lively hop bitterness and tangy citrus tones of the IPA that then gives way to the thick notes of chocolate sweetness and roasted bitterness of the Imperial Stout. Considering that the majority of this beer is the IPA, it's really a testament to how deep and rich the B.O.R.I.S. is, as it's flavors are pretty much just as out their as the IPA's are. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a little bit of both too. A full creamy feel from the Stout and then a bit of oily nature form the IPA as well.   Wow! Talk about the best of both worlds. Both these beers are great together and this mashup of styles more than holds it's own. Packed with full flavor while still remaining very quaffable, this is one Black & Tan style to check out!
POSITIVE	poured a dark amber color without much head. A fair amout of lacig.  very floral nose. lots of grapefruit and piinnable  tons of citrud rind on the palate. grapefruit, pinnapple the faint hint of rosemary.  drinkabiliy is nice. nice crispness but it still manages to remain creamy
NEGATIVE	Hazy apricot gold color with a fizzy white head that disappears quickly. The aroma is very mild biscuity grain, slightly grassy, but no real sign of cloves or bananas. The taste starts out crackery, mildly sweet, only hints of yeast, in spite of the sediment. Finishes a bit dryer with some hints of cloves and a bit of lactic sourness. Light bodied, easily drinkable, especially as a hot weather cooler. Nothing really outstanding but still a decently refreshing cooler and worth a try.
NEGATIVE	A nice blend of a Smoked Beer and an American Porter. Pours out to a dark cherry brown color with a medium head that quickly bubbles away and leaves a thin layer of brown foam on top of the beer. Medium low carbonation. Aromas of smoked malts and salted ham fill the nose. Very Rauchbier like. Taste is medium to medium full bodied and somewhat complex; smokey malts, mild hops, sweet molasses in the background. Some grain and earthy notes as well. Nice. Mouthfeel is medium bodied but maintains a robust character and chewy nature. Drinkability is north of average. Wouldn't mind this in place of a regular porter. Recommended.
POSITIVE	Small capped bottle poured into a pint. Thanks clockworkorange.   Dark beer, near black, with a reddish brown highlight, and a rather thin light brown head with decent retention for the ABV.  A very nice aroma, although the alcohol is slightly more noticeable than it should; chocolate dominates, and more on the sweet side. Coffee, some spices, alcohol round it up.  Slightly below full bodied, it is quite flavorful but the noticeable alcohol interferes to some extent with the enjoyment. It is a lot on the sweeter side, and quite pleasant, with multiple chocolate layers, rum, roasted malts, and some occasional bitterness that seems to come from some charring of the malts.  It lacks a little bit of body, and shows more alcohol than it should, but it is still a very nice beer. Cadillac Mountain Stout would be similar, yet a bit better with less alcohol.  Now let's move on to the barrel aged version.
POSITIVE	Pours out a clear, deep amber color with a massive off-white head. There's a bit of lacing and very good retention. Wish it were just a bit darker, but otherwise very nice. The smell is mainly noble hops, maybe just a bit of American in there, or maybe I'm just thinking of the American approach when I smell it. Something new, but not what I hope for in a doppelbock. Not even a whiff of dark, sweet, chewy malts. The taste is about the same. A sharp, spicy, minty hoppiness. Not a lot of bitterness, maybe it was sucked up by the malt, but I can't really taste it either. With some effort, I can taste a bit of caramel sweetness, no chewy, bready maltiness. I like the feeling of the noble hops, but a doppelbock, there's no doppelbock feeling here. This is more like an Alt, and a strong one at that. It still drinks kind of smoothly, with almost no notice of the 7% ABV. It doesn't hit the doppelbock spot, but I enjoyed it. Don't expect anything and you'll probably enjoy it. Really a cool and interesting idea, and I'd reccmmend it for those interested.
POSITIVE	Pours a very dark hazy golden orange color that is completely opaque with a one finger frothy off white head that quickly fades into a thin lasting ring. Sporadic chunks floating around with visible carbonation bubbling up.  The nose on this beer is incredible. Slight earthy leathery malt notes lying underneath a luscious oak character that gives off a huge vanilla aroma with hints of toffee, subtle bourbon, sweet alcohol and maple. It's nice to have a BA beer that isn't just dominated by the liquor. Founders continues to pull this off. Hopefully the taste will be as pleasing.  This beer is surprisingly pretty hop forward with a nice dry bitterness that lingers throughout over the complex body into a sweet dry finish. Medium bodied with a strong sweet alcohol presence that slightly overpowers the leathery malt notes. Again, as in the aroma, the barrel aging crates subtle flavors which are noticeable without killing all of the other characteristics. Slight earthy oak presence with a lot of smooth vanilla and slight toffee flavor. The bourbon is there but most of the heat comes from the high ABV which is not as well masked as I would like. That being said, this beer is complex and flavorful enough to make it pretty damn drinkable. I'm not a big fan of the wheat wine style but this interpretation is pretty good. A bit too hot perhaps but it seems like it will improve greatly with some age.
POSITIVE	On-tap at Bryant Lake Bowl, Minneapolis.  Appearance: Flows like thick maple syrup from the tap, very dark and foreboding, totally opaque in the glass, with a thin skein of rich brown head.  Smell: Mild scents of bourbon wood and maple, faint sweetness, and a hint of chocolate.  Taste: Bourbon, vanilla, maple, very warming. Subtle undertones of roasted coffee and chocolate. More warmth. A dash of sweetness. Subtle coffee bitterness in the background.  Mouthfeel: Rich, robust, full-bodied, creamy.  Drinkability: I'd like to use the term decadant here, but that would imply sweetness. The terms opulent, epicurean and luxurious come to mind. This is a self-indulgent, pompous beast. The maple and bourbon elements add layers of complexity without being overly sweet and during the aging the breakfast stout's harsher notes of coffee & bitter chocolate have mulled even further. While I'd like to drink the entire cask, or mini, or whatever vessel this black gold is pouring from, it's loaded with alcohol. Nobody here seems to know for sure, so I'd guess in the 13%+ range from the immediate warming effect. More please.
POSITIVE	355mL bottle into a Founders snifter on April 27, 2011.  Bottled on February 25, 2011.  A- Pours a beautiful oily black hue into the glass with a fantastic dark tan head that slowly dissolves with a gorgeous lacing.  S- Sweet bourbon and chocolate hit me up front. Oak notes come through as well. Glorious and well integrated. As it warms, faint coffee and a stronger bourbon characteristic come through. I could smell this all day.  T- Easily the best part of this beer. Bourbon and vanilla at the start, but very subtle and mellowed. Followed closely by a chocolate presence and then more bourbon-laced vanilla in the finish. Not a trace of alcohol to be found. Absolutely fantastic.  M- A little light on the carbonation, but makes up for it in its insane smooth and creamy feel.  O- Easily one of the best barrel-aged beers I've had, and does not disappoint in its complexity and well-integrated flavors. A very hyped up yearly release that delivers in every way.
NEGATIVE	12 Oz bottle Golden color with below average head.  Minimal retention.. Sweet honey nose with hints of malt.  Light malt taste... but that is it ... very light beer the finish has a little sweetness,,  Not impressive, but not horrible.
POSITIVE	Poured from a 16.9 oz. bottle into a pilsener glass.  Appears a clear orange color with a big one and a half inch off-white head on top. A big sheet of lace is left on the glass.  Aroma is of caramel malts, a bit of toastiness, and a vague earthy hop presence. Overall it's quite mild, but nothing bad about it at all.  Taste has some sweet caramel malts up front with some toastiness coming in quickly. Midway through I end up getting that same honeycomb like taste that I kind of didn't like in their other beers, but it works better in this one. Finish brings some mild hops of the earthy variety, but the malt definitely dominates.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied, very creamy carbonation that has the crispness of a lager still.   Of the three different Weltenburger beers I have sampled tonight this one is easily the best. There's definitely many better Marzens I've tried, but this one is pretty good.
POSITIVE	765ml (1pt, 9.87oz) bottle from Yankee Spirits, Sturbridge, MA.  Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a dense 1" beige head over the dark amber brew. Laces excellently. Nose is yeasty, sharing the stage with some fruity tinges. Taste is nicely malty, with slight fruit notes, and then followed by a smooth but tangible warmth that starts in the mouth and continues down the throat. Mouthfeel and drinkability are superb, the only problem is you shouldn't be drinking a ton of this, but the desire is certainly there...
POSITIVE	Pours a murky light brown with a 1 inch foamy off-white head that settles to a thin film. There is really no lacing on this one though. Smell is obviously of smoked cheese, smoked meat, smoked wood, campfire smoke, etc. Taste is of the same but it's not as potent as other Aecht Schlenkerla beers with the smoke flavors. This is actually very pleasant, especially since I love smoked meat and cheese. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly thick mouthfeel (can the smoke do this?). Overall, this is a good beer that is much tamer than the other rauchbier I have had from this brewery.
POSITIVE	I poured this exceptional beer into my tumbler at 50 degrees. The beer was a rich black color with a very nice thick tan head. It really looked good. The smell was heavy coffee dark roasted. The taste was the same, heavy dark roasted coffee with a smooth oatmeal cookie finish. I lapped it up an will buy this beer again.
NEGATIVE	Amstel Light is probably one of the best light beers i have ever had. Out of the bottle it is one of the best tasting macro brews ever. It's mouthfeel is what put me on the bandwagon. It didn't feel like you were swallowing a midget. Like some light beers do.
POSITIVE	Pours very near opaque. Just a little light comes through the sides. 2 finger cocoa colored head quickly recededs to a tight lace around the rim of the glass. Chocolate, molassas, and dark fruits in the aroma. I love a fine Baltic Porter as a night cap and this is a fine Baltic Porter. More roasted than Symbrychoff, or Duck Rabbit. Nice bitter chocolate flavor. Also some lactose and a mild acidic bite that adds to the beer. Alcohol is noticable but it fits in perfectly and gets along well with the others. Mouthfeel is good and true to the style. Slight chalky feeling in the aftertaste. Very drinkable. This is a style that I wish we would see more of. You simply can't go wrong with this one, Symbrychoff, or Duck Rabbit. Thanks to the Florida Gators for the beer.
NEGATIVE	Pours a hazy golden color into a pint glass with a nice head.  Aroma is very sweet with a decent hop presence. Not as aggressively hopped as Im used to in a pale ale.  The taste is sweeter than I would like in the style. Sweet, with a nice hop presence. I like it, but it is not my favorite from Stoudts nor one of my favorite examples of the style. However, I appreciate the uniqueness of this brew.
POSITIVE	Dark dark wih creme-colored head, decent retention, great lacing. Aroma is coffee first, chocolate later, and oatiness. Flavor is a combo of roastiness and hop bite, fadeout is long and pleasant with a little sting. Starts smooth then prickles the tongue a bit. A wonderful beer, and the dry finish makes me want more.
POSITIVE	From bottle (as they are now distributed to IL, woo hoo!): Black in color with a moderately thick head of tight brown bubbles. The aromas are on the sweet side with scents of oats, Valrhona chocolate, coffee, aniseed and Christmas spices. The palate is dense and concentrated with the chocolate & coffee from the nose showing in the front follwed by a sweet midpalate of brown sugar and oats. The finish lingers on and on but picks up some bitter hops to balance the sweetness of the midplate. A very nicely balanced beer that is both complex and layered while also being quite drinkable.
NEGATIVE	A - Pours a clear chestnut brown with a towering off-white head. This fades after a minute to a rocky finger-thick cap. Small bubbles of medium carbonation keep this nicely in place.  S - Imposing nose of bonfire smoke, with other elements such as chocolate, dried fig, peat and hay creeping in round the sides.  T - Light honey notes at first, then dark fruits and a little chocolate. Smoke moves in just after the middle and build towards a fairly tart finish. The smoke flavour lingers into a long aftertaste.  M - Light, quite watery mouthfeel. Carbonation is almost non-existent.  D - Pretty good, although I prefer other beers from this brewery. Good drinkablility for the style.
POSITIVE	Picked this up along with devil dancer when I got my CBS. Pours with relatively small head into a stella glass. The smell dances on the nose, full of floral and hops. Smooth drinkability with hops hitting towards the end. Overall a great beer, worth picking up for any beer lover.
POSITIVE	First time I had seen this in Salem. 1pt.9oz bottle. Very nice looking beer mahogany with hints of garnet round the edges, lovelly looking thick creamy tan head. Aroma is rather subdued with the malts giving a breakfast cereal like smell..not unpleasant, but unusual indeed. Taste is very malty and creamy ,hints of semi-dark chocolate in the after taste. But its mostly luxuriant creamy maltiness..I like it. Very nice on the palate a very full and pleasing mouthfeel. Not the best Doppelbock I have had but probably the smoothest and most drinkable in quantity( within reason).
NEGATIVE	22 oz. bomber.  Hazy yellowish hue, bone-white, rocky head.  Aroma: soft hops, lean citrus, lemon and orange, quiet and pleasant.  Taste/mouthfeel: big, bitterness up at the top, pucker and wince, then it winds down. Too, too sour, as well. Not a pleasant experience, actually. Malt is light, body is not firm enough to provide adequate resistence to this intense unrelenting citric bitter bite. Gets mild after that first swallow, but it continues beating the tongue, and it's a bit tough to take.   Halfway in, and it's toned down a touch, but it still makes for a miss off the mark of a pale ale.   "A finely balance session brew. rich golden color, firm body, hopped with Cascade." Well, something went wrong here. Balance isn't fine, can't imagine a session with this sourness, and ...wooo! Just took another sip...still alarmingly sour! Something is amiss, somewhere...sorry, I tried my best to like it!
POSITIVE	I had this at the Michigan Brewers Guild Winter Beer Fest, back-to-back with their usual Breakfast stout!  A: Dark black with a tan head (doesn't really look any different, but you can't really get darker than dark black!)  S: Awesome aroma. In addition to the dark roasted notes, this one has a ton of boozy bourbon!  T: Now that's a full flavoured stout! The bourbon actually helps to balance the roasted assault on your tastebuds. The alcohol is assertive, but not overwhelming. Awesome (pushing a '5').  M: I didn't like the mouthfeel as much as the regular breakfast. This one was a little acidic. The carbonation was a little higher as well.  D: Big, bold & beautiful. Obviously not a session brew.
NEGATIVE	A decent wheat beer in appearance, no noticeable aroma. Aggressively carbonated. Certainly taken straight, without lemon, and did not find it citrussy on own.. Grainy,a bit on sweet side. Tastes Bit of milk of magnesia, but other than that an quaffable beer.
POSITIVE	Picked this one up in June of 08 at Dilly Deli in Mariemont, Ohio. I was afraid it might be passing it's prime, so I cracked it open.  The label on this beer kinda reminded me of walking down the beer I aisle with my days, when I was as a kid and to be scared of the label! It looks like a vintage bottle of ipecac or some old German hair tonic you'd see for sale at the local flea market. Let's try this one!   Before I opened this, I peered in the bottle and it looked ominous... Much to my surprise, this poured like a Newcastle - a clear, dark brown with ruby highlights sitting atop your average tan head.   A good whiff brings the kind of smoke you'd smell when unwrapping the gold foil on your Thanksgiving ham! After the head settles, I smell nice sweet malts.  Wow, mouthfeel was not what I had anticpated, as either! It starts like an English pub ale, like Samuel Smith's with nice earthy hops and semi-sweet caramelized malts and then toward the middle and end, the ham-like smoke comes out to the font. Light bodied and medium flavored overall.  Drinkable in the colder seasons, by the fire, in my opinion and certainly worth a try. Solid 4's across the board!
POSITIVE	Had this on tap at the Three Floyd's Brewpub. Poured in a medium sized Tulip Glass.   A: Very dark, w/ a rich tan colored head. Almost to the point of jet black. Nice two finger head on this one. So far, better than your typical stout for sure.   S: COFFEE and CHOCOLATE heaven! I love it, strait espresso, dark roasted malts forefront, w/ a subtle dark chocolate in the back.   T: Wow, you can't deny this beer is awesome! Huge coffee notes, dark chocolate, and just a hint of bitterness that adds into the overall enjoyment of this brew. Make no mistake, this sucker tastes like fresh espresso w/ hints of chocolate and a gloriously smooth and luxurious mouthfeel. You can slam this beer like a Guinness, but it's not flat by any rights of the imagination.   MF: Smooth, elagent, lightly carbonated, but a nice creamy mouthfeel. Just great.   Overall, I love this beer and have been through three 4-packs in the last couple weeks. I need to buy a couple cases so I can have it whenever I want throughout the winter.
POSITIVE	picked this up at the store on friday and glad i did. it poured a dark amber to a red color. the hoppiness was not as present as i expected, but it there, adding a nice level to the beer. the smell of the beer was of a airy lager. the taste was sweet with a nice slight bitterness of the hops.
NEGATIVE	Poured from a 12oz. bottle into a Darkness snifter.   A: Extended pour yields a 1.5 finger, thick, coarse, light cream head with great retention. Beer is a clear, almost opaque, dark mahogany. Lacing is thick and layered with amazing cling.   S: Nose is prunes, sweet roasted malt, and resiny hop bitterness. Slight notes of maple syrup, brown sugar and caramel. Aromatic and very appropriate for the style.   T: Opens sweet brown sugar, pine cone, and caramel... almost sappy. Next comes astringent and piney hop bitterness mixed with maple sweetness. Prunes, raisins and other dark fruit cover the hop bite just a bit towards the end. Finish is accented sap and resiny hops with a noticeable presence of booze. Aftertaste is piney and resiny hop bitterness that sticks to the cheeks.   M: Medium bodied and moderately carbonated. Oily and filmy in the mouth. Goes down smooth and silky with the faintest hint of bubbles at the end. Finish is accented and a bit hot with a slightly lingering aftertaste.   D: I'll be the first to admit that I'm not a huge fan of the American Barleywine style. However, I get what is trying to be accomplished here, and as with any of their darker beers, Founders has produced a success. Great complexity and very smooth with almost no hint of that 12% abv. Worth a try and I'll be eager to see how this one develops.
POSITIVE	A: A beautiful black color with a nice light brown/tan head. The head subsides and a thin rim remains around the glass throughout the beverage.  S: Chocolate and coffee aromas with a minor presence of alcohol.  T: The taste is amazing. Coffee and chocolate collide to make a perfect mix. The alcohol is hidden very nicely and it is extremely smooth.  M: Full bodied with a nice creamy texture that slides down the throat perfectly.  D: Extremely drinkable and could have this easily for breakfast.
POSITIVE	From a bottle into a snifter.  A: Black with a mediam brown head.  S: Vanilla, Chocolate, Bourbon.  T: Alcohol is masked well, but the bourbon is a little overpowering for me. I think I would have preferred to hold onto it for another year as I assume the bourbon would be muted slightly. The chocolate and vanilla were noticeable, but there was very little coffee, which surprised me as it is what I love so much about the FBS.  M: Full bodied and slightly undercarbonated in my opinion.   O: Founders has done a great job balancing all the flavors, but the bourbon would be better slightly muted in my opinion.
POSITIVE	A medium bodied dopplebock with a malty chocolate finish. The alcohol is not noticeable but i more prevalent in the finish. Dark brown and opaque in color with a malty nose that is very drinkable and smooth. Sweet finish as it is very malty like a dopplebock should be.. a must try from Stoudts.
POSITIVE	22oz Bomber $4.35 Liquid Solutions  Probably not the night to be drinking a stout with as hot as it's been but what the hell? Pike 5x Stout pours the blackest of holes into my snifter. Not one bit of light can sneak through. The body swallows every bit of light that comes into contact with this beer. A 1+ finger brown head forms and slowly fades to a thick cap. Leaves drink lines down the glass after each gulp.  Aroma is like nothing I've smelled in previous stouts. Theres a solid smokiness in there that reminds me of smoked bacon. May sound strange but it smells damn fine. Mild roasted malts with a solid hop presence on the backend. Mild hazelnut in there as well.  Wow! What a delicious unique stout. That smokey bacon (or is it just campfire and I'm hungry) scent is in the flavor as well. The smokiness blankets a mildly roasted malt and hazelnut nuttiness. A hint of milk on the finish with a combination of burnt malt and hop bitterness. Delicious!  Mouthfeel is just how I'd like it to be. Medium bodied. Not too heavy.Sluggish carbonation that lets the brew roll along the tongue. Nice bitterness on the swallow.  An incredibly drinkable stout, especially with the robust smokiness. The alcohol level helps the drinkability as well.  I'm actually blown away by this brew. Before I ordered the bottle I saw it had good reviews but I didn't expect this. A really wonderful unique stout.
POSITIVE	Pours a clear brown with a ruby and amber tint. Nose is niiiice. Nice hoppy, red character. Me like. Flavor is hoppy and like a red ale as well. Nice robust tones that stay constant. Feel has a good carbonation and nice liquid feel. This is damn drinkable. A very well made brew. Must try.
POSITIVE	A 12-ounce bottle with a portly pork chop of a pooch right on the label, poured into a fat dimpled seidel yields an ebony body sparkling with gold-tinted bubbles that build a short layer of dark beige foam. The cap fades quickly into a sticky-collared sheet that scatters wispy lacing around the glass.  The smell is roasty and rich with a hefty dose of spiced chocolate and a whip of licorice. An acrid charred maltiness permeates the encounter.  The taste is laden with bold, bitterish blackened malts and is only semi-sweetened by a rich, savory dark chocolatiness. Smooth caramel and mellow oats provide a fine milky silkiness with just a twang of spicy alcohol and a tad more grainy sweetness, but the burnt charcoal bitterness bitchslaps the semi-seco notion flat, ruling the aftertaste with an acrid, bitter smokiness that clings to the palate.   The drink is medium-bodied with fine, mild carbonation, and with the big boozy ABV so very well-hidden, Fat Dog hardly seems like any sort of an "Imperial" anything when drinkability is the question at hand. The brew is burly and potent, yet highly drinkable and soothing. Good Dog, Fatty. That'll do.
POSITIVE	Well we survived the DC snowpocalypse of 2010 but still have no power. I'm getting annoyed and the house is getting colder by the hour, so I deceded to get something from the cellar to lighten my mood and warm me up a little. KBS just sounded like a perfect way to start the cold night off, and it's my first KBS ever as well.  Pours black as can be in the dark, and just as black when held up to the candle light. Not much head to speak of but left a little lacing on the glass as I drank it.  Aroma has bitter coffee, chocolate with a little more subtle wood, vanilla, and Bourbon coming through. Very appealing and complex nose.  The taste is very heavy on the bitterness with a lot of coffee, chocolate, and roasted grains coming through. The bourbon also comes through very well and compliments the other flavors, but isn't overpowering. As in the nose the oak and vanilla are a little more subtle then the other flavors, but add a nice complexity to the beer.  Mouthfeel is thick and carbonation is low, pretty much what I would expect from this style. Very drinkable and delicious, I could use a few more of these tonight to warm me up.  Overall an excellent beer. Breakfast stout is already an amazing beer and the barrel aging really adds to it in this case making it more complex and delicious. Can't wait to buy this here in VA this year.
POSITIVE	Poured a reddish amber color with a small, off white head that left light lacing on the glass. Aroma of pine, citrus fruits, resin, caramel / toffee, and light alcohol. Taste of much of the same, with some woodiness, and light alcohol in the finish. Alcohol wasn't as pronounced as other "triple IPAs".
POSITIVE	Reviewed out of a proper Schlenkerla glass from a bottle purchased fresh at the brewery while I was in Bamberg last week.  Appearance: Pours a crystalline and bright straw gold, absolutely transparent, and replete with some of the most vivacious effervescence you've ever seen. It's lively, bright, and vivid, but not overly mercurial, suggesting this beer has definite substance and body. The bubbles - mostly average sized - stream slowly upwards towards a pure white head, fluffy, about one finger and change high, with remarkable clarity, retention, and structure. It's rocky, alabaster-like, perched atop the surface of this beer like a snowy crown. Creamy, slippery dots and blots of lacing hang lazily along the sides of the glass.   Aroma: Very faint. Indiscriminately crisp, sweet, in that corny, pilsener-y sort of way. Not this beer's best quality - faint bitterness and just the memory of a kiss of smoke exist at the edge.   Taste: A soft and subtle blend of soft and smoky, bitter and bright, earthy and heavy and airy and wholesome. A faintly sweet but largely balanced malt backbone provides pure malt notes, nothing fancy, almost bracing in its simplicity. A faint hoppiness compliments the wholesome gritty earth of the malt backbone, adding hints of grass and leafyness, and, ah yes, the smoke. I didn't think I'd really be able to detect it - maybe it's all those years of vegetarianism that makes me oddly in tune to hints of smoke - but it's here, and it's nice. Crisp earth, like after a late spring snowfall, dirty but not rugged, the balance here is pleasant.   Mouthfeel: Perfect. An incredibly light and airy body augments both the soft, subtle, smooth sweetness of the malt body as well as the sweet, woody, smokiness that lingers just around the corners of this beer.   Drinkability: A light, pleasant, flavorful beer, one of the more interesting hells I had the opportunity of sampling while in Germany. A definite standout.
POSITIVE	Pours dark as midnight with a slight brown head. Fantastic roasted smell with accompanying initial flavor. The roasted malt flavor gives way to notes of coffee and mocha. Slight hints of alcohol start to nudge in but are quickly pushed aside by a delicious smoked finish. The drinkability is exceptional for a beer this big. Very enjoyable and you definitely get your money's worth.
POSITIVE	A smoked wheat beer? I have no idea what to expect... Appearance is crazy! Pours a dark brown malty color with a tremendous frothy head that has incredible staying power... looks similar to a dunkel weisse... The smoked smell definitely stands out and dominates the aroma, with a very faint wheat smell in the background.... no fruity or citrusy notes here... mainly a smoky smell that isn't as overwhelming as the Marzen... Taste-wise, the wheat creeps through, but isn't as noticeable as the strong smoked flavor that captures the essence of this unique beer... Never tasted anything like this and I was quite impressed by the fact that although apparent, the smoked flavor is not quite as overwhelming and dominating as compared to the Marzen version, which in my opinion, is a bit too aggressive... This achieved a nice balance, and I really liked it... Will buy this again, and certainly recommended...
POSITIVE	had both as a 12 oz bottle in a pint glass and on tap in a snifter  it pours an amber color with red highlights. seems very hoppy with stong aftertaste. the bitterness hits just at the end of the sip. the alcohol is warming. thick and syrupy, but it still goes down smooth.
NEGATIVE	A: poiurs a beautiful rusty garnett with a nice off-white head and a good amount of lacing.  S: great smoky character atop plenty of wood and a bit of sweetness. Fairly one dimensional but it's definitely done right.  T: smoke and almost a bit of gamey meat. Another impressive smoked beer from the folks over at Heller Trum.  M: a little bit on the thin side for flavors this full.  D: a great beer for a few ounce glass, but a little more than that (especially without an accompanying food pairing) and this will get overwhelming.
POSITIVE	Gift from the wife at $3.99/bottle. Thank you wife! Looks nice in an English pint glass. Dark brown with a tan foamy head. Smell is out of this world. Caramel & dark malts, scotch, peat, alcohol, hardwood, this is one of the best smelling beers I've yet had. Taste has a sharp , almost acrid bitterness that lessens as you progress through the beer. This is what many will notice first off, but after a while you realize it's balanced with a lot of sweetness - again caramel and toffee, some vanilla. This is a wildly complex beer. Mouthfeel is nice, but bubbles are a bit sharp, particularly for an English Ale.
POSITIVE	A - A very pale straw yellow beer that had a head that receded to not much. Minor splotch ring on the side.   S - Bananas, yeast, some clove. Smell is pretty spot on.   T - Found this to be a pretty nice representation of the style. More yeast forward than the nose indicated. Some semi-sweet banana flavor, touch of clove. Pretty solid.   M - Almost feel like this is a cask beer. Low carbonation, smooth, lighter side of medium bodied.   O - A pretty nice little hefeweizen that was refreshing and easy to drink. Would drink again.
POSITIVE	Nitro-tap @ Founders. 8oz pour into snifter.  A - A silky black with a fluffy head with a tight tan color. Super sticky, lots of lacing along the edge of the snifter. The head does not disipitate at all, it just hangs around.  S - Chocolate covered coffee beans, bourbon, caramel.   T - Milk chocolate, bourbon, slight bitterness, coffee beans. I would smack my lips together over and over after every taste, so good!  M - Smooth, creamy, soft, medium-full bodied but not overly so, just right. Very little fizzy carbonation, perfect.  D - So easy, so scary!   I didn't think KBS could get better but out of the nitro-tap, it is!
NEGATIVE	12oz, bottled 1/7/2009. Thanks to my friend Steve for picking this up for me on a business trip to Michigan.  Poured a coppery-orange color with a mild haze from the bottle conditioning. A foamy off-white head pours thick, but thins fairly quickly. Aromas are sweet smelling - caramel malt with a floral hop character. Also herbal notes with some tropical citrus on the nose. I was surprised at how the malt stood out with the aroma. Taste goes with the aroma - again malt upfront that is biscuity and sugary and holds up well to the hops. Some mild citrus flavors do peek through - ripened pineapple, with some slight orange. Herbal notes also stand out. Finishes slightly bitter, but very sweet also. Alcohol is definitely present, but not over-bearing. I guess I could say I was disappointed with this one. It's decent but there are better Double IPAs out there in my opinion.
POSITIVE	With a vigorous pour, this brew makes about a finger and a half thick head of dark khaki, and has a pitch black colored body that allows absolutely no sunlight through it.  The aroma is light with metallic hops, and a good coffee fragrance too.  Taste wise it's more than on par with semisweet chocolate, coffee.  Feel wise it's on the creamy side with a little oily slickness, which is a bit surprising since this isn't loaded with hops.
POSITIVE	Appearance: Arrives at the bar with an almost black color and a neat tan cap that declines to a ringlet, leaving a few strands of lace  Smell: Smells like an espresso   Taste: A lot of lactose up front, with the bitter coffee flavors taking a while to arrive; after the swallow there is a fruity element to the bitterness that is also very acidic; lots of coffee and cream at the finish  Mouthfeel: Light to medium body with moderate carbonation  Drinkability: Unlike any other coffee beer, this one has some real bitter coffee flavor and is well worth trying when it appears on tap
NEGATIVE	7.1%ABV 500ml can, lets hope I enjoy it more than the bottle I reviewed back in 2008.  The can had a best before of 27 Apr 2011, it was reviewed two months later: poured into my Budweiser Budvar 0.2 litre tasting glass on 23 Jun 2011.  No complaints from the look, bright, clear and golden. Lovely white head on each pour of the three.  Grainy, metalic type smell, but strangley not offensive.  The taste is all about the alcohol, with a drying bitterness that I didn't really take too. There is a hop mini feel in the flavour, but it just didn't seem to do much taste wise.  I could see two pints of this giving you the mother of all hang-overs. It's the sort of beer drunks drink out of brown paper bags!  As unimpressed as I was with the bottle, but for completely different reasons: have my tastebuds changed, or has the beer?
NEGATIVE	I believe this is last years release. Poured from bottle into pint glass.  A- dark dark brown almost black. Thin film of head that does leave scattered lacing.  S- Smell of espresso grounds and bitter dark chocolate.  T- dark (black) coffee, bitter sweet chocolate. Something syrupy in there. As it warms a little bit of hop and alcohol appears.  M- Smooth on the tongue with a tingle of carbonation. A little thin for my tastes. Finishes dry.  D- Very delicious beer, but probably wouldn't want more than 2 or 3 in a sitting.
POSITIVE	This beer was purchased at Jungle Jims for $1.50. The beer was served in a pub glass.  Appearance: The beer has a very eye pleasing golden yellow coloration. The carbanation is practically rolling. The head was a off color white.  Smell: The beer has a sulfur skunkyness about it. There is smell of wheat permeating the beer.  Taste: The beer has a ok roasty wheat flavor. There is a bit of hops to break up the taste. I kind of felt let down here. Wait a minute. I served the beer to dam cold. The beer let go more of a sweet wheaty taste. The hops do the job in breaking up the sweetness.  Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The beer is light bodied with rolling carbonation. This beer really is a quaffable drink.  Somehow I expected more from this beer. I have worked as a nurse for many years. Almost all of the older guys I have taken care of described Pilsner Urquell as a great and tasty beer. I dont know if they reformulated the beer or not. This just doesnt live up to what I was expecting.
POSITIVE	Appearance: clear golden yellow in color with a 1" head that lasts a bit. Some light lacing paints the glass.  Smell: bits of floral bitterness is detectable.  Taste: caramel, nice balancing bitterness with some soft grapefruit citrus tones. Basic mild IPA here that is not in your face.  Mouthfeel: lightly crisp throughout. A bit of dryness arrives at the finish. Medium bodied. Short aftertaste as the flavors linger softly in the mouth.  Drinkability: easy to quaff IPA. One of those beers you get in a plastic cup to walk around town with.
POSITIVE	Deep and oil-black with a delayed lacing, this impressive double chocolate coffee oatmeal stout boasts of a strong and appealing dark chocolate scent up front. The flavor profile ranges from a smooth chocolate at first, followed by a bitter coffee followthrough. But with the oatmeal addition, this one's really quite smooth. The high alcohol content is hidden well by the rich and deep flavor profile. Exquisite.
POSITIVE	Man, I hate to be the first one to rain on the CBS parade down a confetti-filled street in downtown Manhattan, but I wasn't wowwwwed by it like everyone else seems to be.   Had a small glass at Stub & Herb's last night at the Founder's release party. Pitch black. Nose quiet but intriguing with the correctly advertised smells.   Taste is subtle coffee with a lot of backing sweet malts, tangled up with the hint of maple that I might not have picked out if not for the blurb in front of me. A little vanilla, just a hint of bourbon, a few puppy dogs tails thrown in for good measure. Lots of stuff going on, but all fairly subtle, & the overall taste was good, not spectacular.  Hard to judge drinkability by the small serving, but I could have easily downed a pint of this, so that's good, right (I mean good score, not good that I didn't, since I had to back out of the parking lot where some ass had parked me in, but that's another story...).   Overall a very good beer. Personally I'd take the regular Breakfast Stout or KBS over the CBS, but glad I had a chance to try it, & if it shows up in the Cities again, I'll go have another glass.
POSITIVE	Pours as you expect any big stout, black, brown short lived head. Big punch of coffee and roasted malt in the nose, I get a sense of hops but its out done by the roast and coffee. The taste repeats the smell and is big on black coffee and roasted malt. Bitterness is respectable and the hops are there. Its drinkable, which I must say, I really like. I love a huge 10% stout just as much as the next person but I really appreciate a stout with huge flavor and less alcohol because I always want a second. Overall, a lovely beer, I imagine some cellaring could make this beer feel a bit more refined but I like it bold and how it is.
NEGATIVE	Poured in to Duvel tulip  A - Poured a deep amber colour with a little shade of red throughout. Small traces of white head and lacing.   S - Tart cherries and caramel malts.   T - Tart cherry juice. The frist couple of sips almost make you pucker but then the taste bids adjust and there is a nice smooth cherry flavour with some tartness in the aftertaste. The malts aren't noticeable in the palate.   M - Light body with a bit of chew. Lightly carbonated.   D - I wasn't sure if I would even like this beer and it turned out to be a nice buy. I would buy this again.
POSITIVE	Ok so, this brew yields only a little white head and has a golden orange color. The smell is a slightly dank herbal hop that's light and well balanced with the malt it seems.   Glug glug glug  Hits with a balanced flavor that fades into a bitter hoppyness that coats the tongue. The hops are mostly herbal tasting and balanced for the style for sure, but I still feel the malt character on this is weak. The whole mouth feel is a little thin and this brew ends up coming off like a decent IPA that watered down.
POSITIVE	jet black color and a really nice espresso crema dark head. it looks amazing just in the glass.  nose has nice sweetness and licorice w/ roasted notes  taste is excellent and full with very rich body of roasted malts and a very nice sweetness to balance this beer. Very complex and hint of licorice and candied malt.  wow what a great stout and worth the $6 bomber price i paid.  this brew is top notch
POSITIVE	A: dark, dark brown with a 1+ finger head of a dark tan  S: intense coffe aroma, faint tobacco on a deep whiff. I pick up dark chocolate but it is the coffee that dominates.  T: bold dark roast coffee,chocolate and smooth oats. but again coffee takes center stage  M: full body, smooth and a bit silky with subtle carbonation  D: great beer, to say the least. This was long awaited and hard to find.
POSITIVE	Poured into a pint glass @ the cove in Baton Rouge. Translucent orange/brown with a slightly off white head.   Heavily smokey notes with the more faint standard weizen fare of banana and spicy clove.   Tastes like straight up liquid smoke. Absolutely delicious, however. The weizen tastes are actually pretty difficult to distinguish here. The body is medium with a grainy mouthfeel. Drinlability is good.
POSITIVE	12 oz. bottle, label says 8.7% ABV. Dark chestnut color, with some ruby around the edges. Thin tan head disappears immediately.   Oak, vanilla and caramel aroma, with a bit of dark fruit. A bit boozy in the nose as well.   Lots of oak present in the flavor. A fair amount of caramel, but the oak still takes over. Warming alcohol presence.   Seems a bit thin, not much carbonation. Either this is overdone, or just needs to sit and chill out for a while. I was kind of disappointed, I felt the oak took all of the character away from the bastard.
NEGATIVE	Sampled from a 12oz Bottle provided courtesy of brewdlyhooked13  Aroma is of american hops with some spice and fruit with brown sugary malt. On top of this deep amber orange beer is a soft white crisp head.  Flavor, is lightly malt with a sharp metallic twang in the middle palate that rides rough over the middle of the beer leading into a thicker brown sugar finish.
POSITIVE	Had this on a Saturday night and was thoroughly impressed.  A: The beer came to me from across the bar, so I watched it get poured. It was golden orange with some haze, not cloudy, but noticeably not clear. The head was small, less than one finger high, and this was by no fault of the bartender, it just came out that way. The head is white and it leaves fast, there's no carbonation here active or otherwise it appears. 3.5/5  S: Mild (at least in this atmosphere) but the rye is very much there. Maybe some German hops, perhaps saaz? Or that could be the spicy rye. No regular malts that I can detect. 4/5  T: Rye is again prevalent, and the brewer seems to push the amount to which one can take rye, but it works nice. Again, spicy saaz hops, but maybe something English?? Could be fuller bodied taste, but that's sort of the nature of a pale ale. This RPA is not as sweet as so many McCann's beers I've had, which is a plus. 4.5/5  M: Like the taste, this beer is a little light in the mouthfeel. But the more I drink, the more I come to like that, some Rye's are to creamy. I'm not even noticing any lack of carbonation. 4.5/5  D: Great RPA, not something I would want all the time, but if I was having a rye beer, this would be near the top for me, and is definitely something to check out if you're in the area. 4/5
POSITIVE	Appears a pale copper hue slightly hazed much akin to a Two Hearted with fluffy slightly off white eggshell hued head, dimples nicely sticks to my HopDevil pint with no excuses looks beautiful but we've heard to watch out for those. Aroma contains piney and citrus layers of freshly opened hop packs before adding to your homebrew these are pelletized bastardized at their best blended with a touch of skunk, citrus peel, herb, and pine but a bit heavy on the pine sol component with light biscuit malt sweetness arising around the edges. Flavor....mouth full of pine cone and citrus peel great stuff dry hopped with alpha acids in mind great oily texture flowing mild tame biscuit creamy sweetness excellent pale ale, actually just as magnificent as the label. Refreshing as all hell with hop oils floating thank god for Founders, yes I did capitalize one of those sorry G man. Mouthfeel is resinous medium bodied evenly carbonated the kind of lusciousness that goes a long way, at least until the bottom of this glass. Great stuff watch out, of course it's drinkable give me a mini keg so I can die in peace.
POSITIVE	Pours a hazy copper/golden color with a one finger head that is neither very creamy or fizzy. It retains at about a half of a finger for a fair amount of time. A tiny bit of lacing is left and the beer ends up looking almost like juice. Smell is big on malts and has a nice earthy hop backbone. I also get a tiny bit of citrus hop. The pale malts and grains are nice on the nose. I would like a bit more strength here as it is hard to get a large amount of anything on the smell. Taste has a very nice massive malt backbone. The hops are earthy and some are floral. There is nice hop taste melded in with the flavors and bitterness to compliment the overall taste and feel of the beer. It is very nice to get huge malts in an APA. The hops certainly help to add a nice backing to the malts though. Body is light but has some creaminess to it, which I like. The carbonation feels extremely smooth and there is no warming at all. Very nice feel for an APA. If this one was a bit cheaper it would be the ultimate session beer. It is however a very good example of an APA. It is like a classier, more complex version of Sierra Nevada Pale Ale (the ultimate session APA). Founders continues to amaze me with the quality of their beers.
POSITIVE	On tap at the Bavarian Lodge, poured into a Schenkerla tulip.  A gorgeous clear copper pour with a nice thick head.   Like all the Rauch beers, this one was a smoky, campfire odor to it, yet the oak smoke is different than the typical beechwood smoke; still pronounced and even frightening to some, but more subtle and a little less harsh  The mouthfeel is surprisingly clean and crisp, and the flavor is sublime. It's smokey, of course, but very balanced, and makes the beer quite drinkable. If you've never had Rauch beer before, just make sure you take a second sip!  I've become a big fan of Schlenkerla lately, and this is the best I've had. A real winner.
NEGATIVE	Pours a cloudy ruby with great white head that sticks around for the whole time drinking.  The smell isn't as hoppy as I'd like. I pick up mostly malt but with a little grapefruit from the hops.  The taste is along the lines of the smell. Very malty. The bitterness is there and overall very balanced but I was hoping for a little more hop flavor on this one. I pick some grapefruit and lemon but it is almost over powered by the malt.  Not a bad beer but not my favorite IPA either.  Edit: Bottle is about 2 months old.
POSITIVE	appearance: pours a beautiful copper, with off-white head that dissipates quickly, modest lacing.  smell: hops with some floral notes, alcohol smell comes through also.  taste: full-bodied IPA with the 7.2% alcohol coming through prominently. Not sure if my bottle is a little old, but the aftertaste leaves a little to be desired. Still a refreshing beer regardless.  mouthfeel: carbonated a smooth, bitter but delicious  overall: Centennial used to be one of my favorite IPAs, but it has fallen off lately. Nevertheless, this is one of Founders' staples and an excellent beer.
NEGATIVE	A: Poured a medium-dark orange with a soft and creamy 2 finger light beige head that lasted for a minute or two before receding and leaving a spothcy, broken sheet leacing. Visible carbonation was medium-strong.   S: moderately strong with spicy oranges and caramel malt with some noticeable alcohol notes.  T: spicy and sour oranges delivering a big tart presence in the beginning. Overall the flavor was pretty limited in complexity with sharp, acidic, sour oranges that quickly fade to a subtle tart finish. Overall the flavor was quite odd per style I though and best described as alcoholic, tart oranges.   M: light, slick, and oily with a spicy alcoholic tart orange flavor.   D: Less then moderate drinkability and not many reasons to try or like. Flavor gets tiring quickly and didn't make me look forward to next sip. Packaged in 500ml bottle and not embarrassed to say I just couldn't finish or rather cared to.
POSITIVE	Poured into an Aventinus glass(the only clean classy glass available), it looks beautiful, a glowing orange color, significantly hazed, lighter at the bottom, capped with a lean layer of white foam. Aroma has all the usual hallmarks of a saison or a biere de garde, yeasty, sour, a bit of funk, plentiful fruit, but this one is topped by pleasing, mellowing honey tones. Nice, again. That honey flavor is much more pronounced in the taste, heck, it's fairly tangible, slick and supple on the palate, and only growing bigger.  Medium bodied, with honey and lemon on the ever-so pleasant finish. Perhaps the most honeyish of any honey beers I've tried, beating the previous champ, Dupont's Biere du Miel. I like it.
POSITIVE	Appearance: red/dark brown in color, with 1/2 inch head, high carbonation  Smell: chocolate and cherries--like a cherry cordial  Taste: some milk chocolate with roasted malt and cherries...like a liquid cherry cordial.  Mouthfeel: light body, medium/high carbonation, very sweet.  Drinkability: Not sure if I taste beer here, but it is a guilty pleasure none the less. I can see how others may dislike this. It is a liquid cherry cordial and is perfect for dessert. I love the taste and wish I picked more up. A really good drink.
NEGATIVE	12 oz. bottle poured into a pint glass. Three fingers of white rocky head and a slightly cloudy (due to bottle conditioning) pale orange color. Head dissipates slowly with lots of sticky lacing. Aroma of pine trees and citrus. Initial sweetness blends with intense hop bitterness before finishing sweet again with a strong citrus aftertaste. Has a very full-bodied mouth feel, you'll want to take your time and enjoy all the complex flavors that this beer has to offer.
POSITIVE	(12oz bottle courtesy of jcnd9803!). Pours hazy golden with white head. Aroma is huge grapefruit, mango and tropical fruits. Love it! Taste is sweet with big bright hops adding a pleasant layer of bitterness. Lighter bodied with slick texture and bitter finish. This is one great DIPA.
NEGATIVE	This poured a clear dark copper with some light tan head. It smelled like orange and caramel and bready yeast, with some lemon zest. It tasted like orange and copper hops with some barley and bready yeast and a bit of caramel. It was slightly thick with some carbonation, and had a bitter aftertaste. Overall this beer didn't have a very distinguished flavor, with a generic and bit dirty taste. It had good body and was easy enough to drink, but it was boring and unimpressive. So while this wasn't necessarily a bad beer, I had no motivation to finish the glass, and certainly not to try it again.
NEGATIVE	Served in a .5L Schlenkerla willibecher at the Map Room. Dense head, delicate sheets of lacing. Brown amber color, with varying shades due to the willi glass.   Smoke aroma recalls canned sardines somehow. Oddly appropriate for Lent. Smells rather bright and fresh, unlike danker, meatier scent of the Urbock, perhaps. Something sweeter comes through. This is an incredibly fun beer to smell.  Refreshing. Definite trademark smoke flavor, but not super huge. Sweetness is more upfront. Malt profile like a Helles almost. Finishes malty with the lingering salty smoke, and mild bitterness.   Medium body and light carbonation give it a creamy feel.  I never find Schlenkerla beers to be super quaffable. The flavor is so bold to start with that I take small sips, and before I know it, I've had about a tenth of the glass after 10 minutes. Does start to go down easier after getting used to the flavor. Really could use a meal with this. All in all, no regrets in trying this, but I wouldn't lose sleep over missing it. Fans of the brewery won't be disappointed.
POSITIVE	I was totally surpriseed by this beer. At 10.2% and a Wee Heavy one would think it would be a big beer. Not all to my surprise. The beer had a great taste, wonderful texture on the mouth and went down smooth. A ver deceaiving beer, it tastes and is as smooth a s a 5% beer, the alcohol can easily sneak up on you.
POSITIVE	Thanks go out to gregc for this brew  Bottle poured into a standard pint glass produced two fingers worth of white head on top of a clear golden colored body.  Aromas of fresh hops run wild on this brew great pine and citrus smell filled my nose. The flavor is lighter than the nose suggests a good APA for sure. Easy drinking light and crisp on the tongue. With the flavors of light pine and sweet malts keeping this APA on track flavor wise. Good drinkability I could kick back a few of these with little effort.
POSITIVE	On-tap at Local Option. Excited to finally try this famed brew.  A - It pours a clear pumpernickel brown and is capped with a scant smattering of off-white bubbles; looks potent. Given the total package, the menacing appearance is quite appropriate.  S/T - The taste and aroma are strongly flavored with hardwood smoke, and complemented by notes of smoked meat, forest-fire, and dark rye bread. It is really hearty, and has complexity beyond the smoke in the form of a slight charred molasses sweetness which is underlying, as well as some (non-smoky) woody bitterness. I enjoy.  M - The feel is just about medium, silky, softly carbonated and quite enhancing.  O - Really good; this is probably my new favorite Schlenkerla.
POSITIVE	a marzen with a wonderful body and a surprisingly wide solid palate of flavor. pour is light amber, almost on the side of gold with no murk really and nice decent amount of foam about 2 and half fingers. nose of stale apples and a ton of malt which i was worried would lead to a breadier than anything beer. not the case. smooth and robust. late late summer of something quite nice like apple pie... with a good tea without sugar. balanced. isn't dense, or sweet... just an apple without the sour acids. a mild sweet with no hint of bitter. light body but a creamy consistency. how do the germans do it.
POSITIVE	Notes from 2/16/11.  Waitress said this is an IPA made with 20% rye and 4 hop varieties.   Pours golden with red hues. A nice 1 finger fluff crowns the brew. Lacing is very nice as it lines the glass all the way down.  There are a plethora of hop flavors in the smell meeting a wort like malt backbone. The hop flavors remind me of orange, pine, lemon, melon, and some black pepper.  The rye really mellows this brew and adds some spice. I was surprised when the waitress said that this was an IPA. The hoppiness blends with the rye to create an easy drink of peppery rye and mild pine hops.  With a medium feel in the mouth and low carbonation, I would describe the feel is understated but effective.  This is a very drinkable brew worthy of a try. Session worthy and with its mild hoppiness, it could be a gateway IPA for the non-hopheads.
NEGATIVE	Picked up a 16.9 oz. bottle and poured this one into a tall mug I picked up in Austria. The head is HUGE... it took a few pours and a little patience to get even 12 oz. into the mug. The beer itself is a dark brown, hazy, looks like there's some sediment in there.  The smell is definitely smoky... pork if there is any one flavor in there, but there are also some cooler malt flavors in the aroma.  The taste is a lot of the same... thinner than expected based on the smell, but tastes of smoky malty pork, like a thick slab of bacon turned into a quality beer. I'm glad it's a little less smoky than the smell, but there's not enough other flavor coming through in its place.  All in all, a solid beer, leaves a little to be desired but still one I'd drink again and recommend to friends. I think this bottle might be a little past its prime... I'll have to remember to try this one again sometime.
POSITIVE	The beer poured pitch black with a barely visible ruby highlight when held to a light source. The head was tan and tall and fell very slowly and laced the glass.  The aroma was roasty chocolate and coffee with a very slight sourness behind. Also present was a fruitiness, namely dark fruits (plums, raisins, prunes) and caramel.  The flavor was dominated by coffee with chocolate far behind. Caramel and dark fruits made up the balance and the slight sourness present in the aroma is also present in the flavor, but does not detract.  The finish was dry with lasting chocolate long into the aftertaste, subtle coffee flavors lingered as well, but they were not pronounced. The body was medium full, not quite full, but well done.  750 ml bottle. Bottled on 9/30/03.
POSITIVE	Had this draft beer at the Bridge in downtown STL.   Appearance: nice clean light color. Little head.  Smell: Sweet smell, some citrus  Taste: Sweet. Overall good taste very drinkable.  Mouthfeel: good  Drinkability: Good beer. Not my favorite type or style, it was quite good and would easily drink again.
POSITIVE	I was at Arcadia just a few hours before strolling into the back country forest preserve party that is the Founders Brewing Company brewpub. And Arcadia's rye might have just been the perfect primer for the Founders Rye, a beer I've had a few firkins of by the bottle and tap, but never one so close to the source. What amazes me still about the Founders Red's Rye is its insistence on freshness. Though a beer absolutely consumed by peppery, anisette hops, it verges on being a drinkable barleywine because the rye is so intense. This beer would only taste better with a corned beef shooter. Which is to say, you never see this much balance in what really amounts to a double IPA. But the graininess here provides great liquid-Jell-O-like texture and body, not to mention flavor, that makes the hops all the more interesting. It's as bitter as all get out, but maybe closer to Rogue's Old Crustacean than to something like 3F's Dreadnaught. I love that. I love that a beer can be this hoppy and still let the malt shine. Not more than five brewers in the world can balance the extremes this well, and none do it better than Founders.
POSITIVE	Pale gold and crystal clear with a nice fizzy head and minimal lace. Smells nice and hoppy, citric with toasted grain. Tastes good, fairly nice hop bite balances well with malt sweetness. Seltzery carbonation and light bodied. Finishes squeaky clean. A good example of the style and stronger than most.
NEGATIVE	a: Haze-free pale golden yellow, with a rocky white head. Scant bubbling, and light lacing.  s: Tobacco tin, spice, metallic herbaceousness  f: A fairly well-balanced blend of hop & malt. Medium bitterness, but with a long aftertaste that becomes slightly astringent.  m: Full mouthfeel, crisp & clean finish.  d: A good quaffer
POSITIVE	Bottled 02/04/10. 12oz. bottle into a snifter. Pours a hazy pinkish amber with a minimal head that disappeared almost immediately, no lacing.   Smells of bourbon, strong bourbon with a hint of maple. Stings the nasal. There is a ton of booze in this. I love bourbon so it smells great to me. But I feel like this is going to be a stiff drink.  Wow this has heat! More of a spirit than an ale. Whew, potent. A sipper for sure, some sweetness comes through on the end... maple with a finish of wheat. It does have a butterscotch feel. Syrupy...a drink is extremely potent...a sip is a smooth, luscious & delicious treat.   As for drinkability this is a sipper for certain. Over the top on the bourbon, so for balance it lacks (definitely going to put some time in the cellar on the rest and maybe it'll mellow). Stoked I had the opportunity to grab a few of these. Enjoyed this sipper! Wish I had more.
POSITIVE	Poured very dark, slow moving-thick, no head out of poor.  Smelled very robust, sweet and chocolaty.  Taste...wow, wonderful...that is a good beer. Very rich, sweet...but yet smooth and very refreshing. Burnt overtones, wonderful taste. Yummy.  Thick feel, almost syrupy, but not the bad-sort.  I'd drink this until I was full (maybe after 3, but who cares...very good.)
POSITIVE	Black in the glass, completely opaque with a thin layer of chocolate milk coloured head. Sheets of lacing abound. Thin head remains for some time.  Smell immediately brings roasted coffee beans to mind. I'm not a coffee guy, but I'd say dark roast. Straightforward aroma, but pleasant.  Much more bitter than expected. Coffee flavour for sure with bitter roasted notes throughout. Citrus hops in finish so strong that blindfolded I would easily have been confused by the style. Different, and tasty.  Full bodied, heavy enough to dull the carbonation but doesn't feel flat in any way. Good mouthfeel.  This comes across as being a very big beer, but stays a bit more drinkable than the RIS/Double Stouts out the by not being too high in abv. Even nicer than I had hoped for.
POSITIVE	This beer pours jet black, 100% opaque with a nice amount of creamy tan head that lingers for a while and leaves a pretty fair amount of lacing too.  On the nose there is a rich, sweet chocolatey smell that I pick up on immediately followed by a less prevalent but equally rich roasted coffee smell along with the malts. This beer just smells awesome.  Flavor wise, it has an unsweetend chocolate flavor and a roasted coffee quality to it, there is virtually no hoppyness, nothing like that, the malts are what make the flavor. The roastyness is more prevalent at the end though, it almost has a nutty quality to it.  This beer is pretty thick and has low carbonation, plus an aftertaste I really enjoy, it finishes on the watery side though, but the extremely low carbonation levels are also awesome.  Mine is 6.6% abv though...
POSITIVE	Poured a nice mahogany color with a thin white head. Beer appeared viscous in the glass. Lots of body.  Tons of bourbon and oak in the nose. Tons of malt in the nose.   Wow! Tons of bourbon on the palate. Some spicy from the bourbon barrels. Malty, burnt flavors. Lots of vanilla in the back palate.  Not much carbonation and viscous, coating mouthfeel. Very silky on the palate. Alcohol is definately present, but not in a harsh way. It is nice and warming.  Overall, a fun, slow sipper. I wish I had more.
POSITIVE	Poured from the tap at the brewery yesterday during my visit there into a clean, clear pint glass.  A Yellow orange slightly cloudy body with little head. 3.5  S Light malt, barley with very little hops. 3.5  T Light malt, barley taste with somewhat larger hops presence than the smell suggested. A very soild Pale Ale and not weak like many I have tasted. 4.0  M Light feel with minimal syrupy stickiness, "goes down" very easily. 3.5  D Very good and I believe that this is the main point. 4.5
POSITIVE	Thanks to drabmuh for this bottle. Consumed on 11.07.2010.  Poured into a snifter. Color is near black with an initial two-finger light mocha head that recedes somewhat quickly and leaves behind a bit of lace. Nose is a bit smoky along with quite a bit of roast. Light chocolate and coffee as well. Taste is lighter with some mild smoke as well as light coffee. Feel is quite thin with low carbonation. Detracts a bit from the flavor. Drinks fairly well and is a nice porter. Glad I finally got to try this one. Thanks again, Matt.
NEGATIVE	Poured into a standard pint glass.  A: A cloudy medium brown dunkelwiess color with a bright white 1 finger head that dissipated quickly. I did not see any red or "cherry" color. Looks like a dark wheat beer as per the description on the package.  S: Exactly what the name says it will be...cherry chocolate. It smells just like the box of chocolate covered cherries that my mother in law buys every Christmas. Way fun for a beer but yet a little bizarre. But, hey, I like chocolate covered cherries and I can't help but just keep smelling this beer. My wife asked if I was going to drink it or just keep my nose in the glass.  T: If you like chocolate covered cherries and are in the mood for a beer that tastes like that then you will like this beer. If not, skip this because it is spot on for the name. There is just a hint of hops bit but it is subtle. There is also a tartness that somewhat offsets the extreme sweetness but I cannot tell if it is the hops or the wheat beer tang.  M: About like most wheat beers, a little thin for my liking but again OK for a wheat based beer. The carbonation is not too high like most wheat beers.  D: One of these is enough at a time. Definitely, a sweet desert kind of thing. I have friends who like amaretto mocha coffee after dinner but since I'm not a coffee drinker this could easily substitute for that in my book.  This beer created quit a buzz at the liquor store when I bought it. The gal behind me in the check out line wanted to know all about it. Her husband was buying a case of Bud Light. The check out girl said she has sold a lot if it this week but nobody has told her what it tasted like. BTW, I gave the woman behind me in line one of the bottles just because she was so curious about the beer. My Christmas present to a stranger! Can you pay it forward with a beer?  I think I'll buy another 6-er just to keep in the fridge for desert in the future. But hey I like to have sheet cake and that yellow fizzy beer together at wedding receptions. ;)
POSITIVE	Nice amber pour, with medium head and decent lace. Nose is piney hops, rye characteristics.  Flavour is similar to the nose, but the pine seems to give way to more citrusy characteristics. Well-balanced by the bitey flavour of the rye, a hallmark of all of Founders rye beers, bready without being heavy. Good stuff.  Drinkability on this is quite good, it's a beer with a distinct flavour, but it's relatively crisp and easy to drink.  Overall: I like all of Founders rye beers. I would probably lean toward Black Rye as my overall favourite of that stable, but Crystal Rye is also a quality product.
POSITIVE	Enjoyed at the bar of the sterling Sun Singer in Champaign, IL.  Slightly hazy burnt orange body with a fat finger of off-white foam topping it; good lacing and head duration. Wonderful smells, loaded with citrus (tangerine, grapefruit, and lemon) with some biscuit malt. The hops emerge strongly in the nose, proving most welcoming.  Harvest Ale is so impressive in good part because the taste fulfills the smell so thoroughly. Hops, hops, and more hops here. The citrusy taste is magnificent--tangerine, grapefruit, orange peel and some lemon give Harvest Ale a largely sweet taste with a slightly tart finish. There is just enough toasted malt to make its presence felt, but hops certainly carry the day here. The resiny finish is magnificent, just the right way to culminate the experience.   I run out of ways to extol the virtues of Founders, which seems to turn every beer into liquid gold. Harvest Ale is no exception. The wet-hopped style is yet another that Founders has taken to another level. This is a very nice complement to Double Trouble, offering a somewhat bolder, brawnier beer than the hop-heavy but rather smooth DT.   Again tremendous, in a way that for all its regularity from Founders, is never pedestrian.
NEGATIVE	A- Pours an odd reddish color with nice creamy head. Head has ok retention and leaves very little lacing.   S- Smells very sweet. I picked up the cherries right away and know I was in trouble. Also picked up a bit of booze and wood. Not a fan of cherries.   T- There it is the ultra sweet fake cherry taste that I hate. I can't really taste too much else here and not really picking up any booze at all.  M- Medium in body and carbonation.  D- I couldn't finish my glass. I'll pass on this one.
NEGATIVE	A - Opaque black with one finger of coffee head and good lacing  S - A little chemically smelling. Lemon, citrus, and floral are faint  T - Almost like a chocolate soda. A little sweet with decent chocolate body and a little hop bitterness on the back  M - Medium body with medium carbonation  D - Pretty good and enjoyable
NEGATIVE	Pours pinkish red with an out of control huge pink/white head. Smells like slightly metallic raspberries. Sorry, can't get into this one. Soda poppy sweet and carbonated, with just a hint of hop character, and some slight interesting sour notes. I was hard pressed to get through 6 oz. of this. Not usually a fruit beer fan, but figured i'd try one from Founder's, a brewery I respect a lot.  Thanks to beerpanther, for letting me try a single of this.  Won't hold it against the brewery, since i still like most of their offerings, but won't be buying this again. Might be interesting as a mixer with a chocolate stout, for those looking for a dessert beer concoction.
POSITIVE	This pours a clear dark brown with a small tan head that disappears quickly. The smell is a smoked wood BBQ aroma that makes your mouth water. The taste is a mesquite wood BBQ. This is like liquid babyback ribs. Malt and molasses are also in this beer. It's almost like a bbq sauce. The m/f is medium with the flavors all mixing well. A wonderful tasting and smelling beer for summer BBQ's. Bring on the ribs.
POSITIVE	Wow a three finger head of light brown head with lots of clinging lace. Color is a 28 on the SRM chart. Smell of smoke, chocolate, coffee, and fruit. Taste of chocolate, smoked fish, coffee, caramel, and malt. Very rich and full in my mouth, a great creamy texture. Very fine flavor and really fills my sense with pleasure, I will have to pick up more my next beer buying adventure.
NEGATIVE	I poured a 12 ounce bottle into a plastic cup at a recent party.  A: It poured a copper hue with orange accents with a healthy light tan head.   S: It emitted a distinct caramel aroma with hints of dark fruits (plums).   T: It was smooth and creamy with a sweet malty front and light clean finish. I got the scotch side but not the wee heavy.   M: Medium mouth feel with a smooth body and clean sweet finish.   D: Nice easy brew but after a couple I needed something without the sweet fuzzy fullness to clean my palate and move me deeper into the party.
POSITIVE	Pours a clear golden hue into a pilsener glass. A significant three finger head.   The aroma is of a very slight hop presence with a nice bread like presence.  The taste is great. A slight bready/ malt presence, with a mild hop taste. Crisp Clean, and highly drinkable. A really great example of what a lager can be. I
POSITIVE	Pretty ironic, had this on tap at ITap instead of down at The Stables. Nice to see the beer luv being spread around. Their board listed this at 5.2% abv.  Nice brew - poured into a standard shaker pint. Clear and deep mahogany brown, but no head or lace on this one.  Subtle hints of sweet malt in the sniff, but the quaff kicked it up a notch with chocolate shake, caramel and hints of banana showing up for the party. Light body and smooth finish really round 'er out.  Easy going, tasty and sessionable - a nice brew for the cool fall/winter weather.
POSITIVE	The Pike Pub has made a decent name for itself in the Pacific Northwest with a nice array of relatively hoppy ales including their IPA, Kilt Lifter and now Naughty Nellie's Ale. Nellie's is the least hoppy of the three, but that would make it a litlte more drinkable for the average uninitiated hophead.   Pours a very light golden color with a nice amount of carbination. A fairly sized, white foamy head forms on the pours which rather quickly gives way to little more than a thin surface coating. Lacing is minimal but the collar is quite substantial.  The malty characteristics of this beer overpower the hoppy characteristics, but that blend tends to give this brew a little more earthy complexure plus a sincere fruity kick overall.  Tastewise, the hops come through a little more in flavor than in aroma, but again the malt build up is the prevailing factor here. Although the hops on this one are used to offset an overpowering malt factor, and its not considered or intended to be a hoppy ale, the hop characters are quite prevelant.  Overall this is a rather enjoyable brew and very drinkable, but it does pale in comparsion to the Kilt Lifter Scotch Ale and their flagship Pike IPA. Give it a try if you get the chance, but if you know you like hops, stick to their more formidable brews.  [ STATS:&gt;&gt; SERVING: 12oz bottle / ABV: 4.7% / PRICE: $1.39 USD ]
POSITIVE	Got a pint of this during my recent visit to the brewery. This beer is a clear, medium to dark, amber/copper color. The white head was an inch thick when served, settling to a nice thick ring lining the inside of the glass. Little lacing. Aromas of citrus hops and a bit of caramel malt. The hop flavor wached me over the head from the first sip, followed by some citrus and slight caramel malt. This is a real bitter hop monster, a one dimensional beer to be sure. Has a crisp, full bodied, frothy mouthfeel with moderate carbonation. Easy enough to drink. Not shabby at all.  Eric
POSITIVE	A deep red rue with orange overtones that shines clearly through my Duvel tulip. A nice grapefruit citrus bomb with malt and touch of booze. The taste is a fantastic balance of sweet malty Founder goodness, thick, creamy, biscuit with lots of hops, its bitter, really bitter, lots of clean pine backed by citrus and followed by more piney citrus goodness. The mouth-feel is nice. I am really starting to love the hop resin as it takes over my mouth and makes my palate feel as if hops had seeped up into my flesh. The malt backbone is thick enough and creamy enough to hold onto all the hoppy goodness. The carbonation is 4 to a 3.75 out of 10, kinda minimal but it serves this big beer well. The drinkability of this beer is present, I believe I could drink this beer all night long, I however prefer to savor beers that are hop over-kill with small sips through out the night.
POSITIVE	This beer is pale orange in my glass. A thick, rocky, creamy head rests on top and reduces very slowly. There is little cloudiness, and no noticeable sediment - which I find odd in a bottle-conditioned beer.  It smells of hops and hops alone. It is a flowery aroma, tangy and slightly citrusy. It is an earthy smell - warming, but without alcohol characteristics.  There is a crisp hoppy flavor, with moderate-to-low carbonation. The hops are intricately arranged - the result is a multi-dimensional flavor. There is a balancing sweetness. It includes a significant bitterness, but not as much as I've noticed in other double IPAs (or even some 'standard' IPAs). The finish brings out more of the bitterness, but also adds a creamy feel. The aftertaste of this beer resides more in the nose than in the mouth.  Quite drinkable for a highly hopped beer, this ale is smoother than one might expect, with an interesting character.  Permitting myself to use vague synesthetic terms, I'd say the smell is brown and dark green, the flavor is bright and orange. This is a good IPA, comfortable and hearty. The alcohol is hidden very well.
POSITIVE	Pours out a clear, amber/orange with a 2-finger, thick, white head that leaves moderate, splotchy lacing. The smell is both fruity and malty, malt dominates. Taste is fruity, citrus hops up front then overtaken by a strong malt flavor and finishes with bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium, well-carbonated at first but low later. Drinkability is fine. I like it and many of those who like IPAs will also.
NEGATIVE	I have had this beer before, but never reviewed it. It poured out of it's 24 oz. bottle a gold color with a fairly large white head. Has the czech pilsner taste that I don't quite know how to describe. Good amount of hops finishing, with almost a tinge of skunkiness.
POSITIVE	Had this on 2011-01-11 in Columbia, PA  A - Hazy amber with a short wide head and mild lacing.  S - Lots of pineapple and orange rind. Smells sweet.  T - More pineapple, orange rind, sweet citrus, herbal, mild roasted grain, hop bitterness. Finishes sweet with lingering pineapple, orange rind and moderate bitterness. Not a hop bomb. Balance is good and alcohol is noticeable but well-integrated.  M - Medium body, light carbonation with a moderate resinous feel that is also creamy.  D - Good flavors and mouthfeel could bring you back for a second one. Well done.
POSITIVE	From 750mL bottle to Bruges hybrid glass on 10/3/11 *From notes  A: Gorgeous bright red. It's astoundingly lovely - I can easily say that I've seen a beer quite like it. A generous pour yields a 1.5 finger flaming pink head that looks like strawberry ice cream. The retention and lacing are top notch.  S: Stodgy Belgian style yeast and off-dry ripe red vine fruit.  T: Initially it's quite sweet, with a what tastes like real raspberries right in my glass. Really, I can't begin to tell you how well Founders nailed this, as I feel like I need to pick the seeds out of my teeth. It's pretty one note, though there is a touch of that yeastiness on the finish.  M: Well done. I'd like it a bit thicker, though seeing as it's not a milkshake, I can certainly understand why they kept a bit more approachable.  O: Founders Blushing Monk is an unexpected yet fantastic way to kick off their Backstage Series. It's one of the prettiest beers I've seen, and if you're into red fruit (specifically raspberries) don't be shy in tracking this one. I'm excited to see where this goes with some time in the cellar.  Thumbs up - this easily gets my recommendation.
NEGATIVE	Black with a one-finger mocha head. Good retention, dies down to a carpet of fine bubbles that leaves a trail of lace. Aroma is full of black coffee, cocoa, sugar cookies, biscuits. The taste has an initial assault of dark roasted malts and loads of black coffee. Some sugar and only the faintest touch of dark fruit are detectable behind all of the coffee which comes close to overwhelming everything. Personally I can't really pick out the chocolate. This is a good stout that brings coffee in my in ridiculous quantities, but balances that with a sweet backbone and lots of roasty goodness. Long coffee and roast finish.   Sure I have had more coffee thrown in my face, but that can get undesirable, and this is fully desirable. Full body, but not thick, the slippery oatmeal quality comes out as it warms. Nice medium smooth carbonation level. The coffee makes me take my time drinking this, but it drinks well. A bottle can be done solo, or it could be shared, yet I am glad I do not have to drink a bomber of this by my lonesome. For me Breakfast Stout is worth drinking on occasion, but not something I would spend energy in seeking out. This costs me $8 a pop and the bottle I had before this one was infected. Too bad we don't get Founders distribution.
POSITIVE	2/24/10  Founders Brew. Co Pale Ale Cascade hops IBUs 35 ABV 5.4%  L= 4.0 Pours into a medium sized 2 finger white frothy head and it has a golden honey orange body.  S= 3.0 Decent nose of light pine and citrus.  T= 3.5 Ok balanced taste. Upfront sweetness the leads into light citrus tartness. Quick dissipating pine on the finish.  F= 3.0 Decent feel medium carbonation.   D= 4.0 this would make a good session beer. It would have received a much higher score but I was comparing it to IPA's. For a pale ale this is really nice.
POSITIVE	Had this a couple of times at the brewery and never reviewed the pre-nitro tap version, but I thought I should at least review the nitro-tap.  A- Very dark brown with the sinking nitro-bubbles creating a mild creamy head.  S- Chocolate and expresso type maltyness. Faint.  T- Initially chocolate and expresso malts followed by soft bitterness.  M- medium bodied, somewhat creamy. Lighter than anticipated.  D- Pretty good. It has a pretty smooth taste. Flavorful with a clean finish. Could have a few of these. I would personally like to see Yazoo do an oatmeal stout rather than the Irish stout, but it certainly is good.
POSITIVE	A_ Thin tan head on a cloudy brown body with some amber hues in it. S- Big bourbon and oak up front in the nose, vanilla, earthy, hints of cherries, light grass, toffee, roasted barley, and one other thing I just can't seem to pick up all blend together nicley in the nose with the bourbon being the main thing to jump out. T- Wow, a interesting blend of roasted, burnt, and lightly toasted barley all with a nice solid wood backing with bourbon trickling over it (not over powering though like the aroma suggests). Grass hops make a slight appearance leaving a nice light bitterness on tip of tongue. Some fruits are found covered with a nice subtle earthy notes all over it. M- Full chewy body with low carbonation and almost a hint of creaminess. D- Love it! Maybe one of my favorites. Just wish the smell wasn't so dominated by bourbon. Thanks Hoppymeal for these!
NEGATIVE	Appearance: dark brown, small head, medium carbonation  Smell: expresso, some chocolate, malt  Taste: expresso, light chocolate, malt  Mouthfeel: bitter heavy and thick  Drinkability: Not as impressed with this one as some of Founder's other offerings. The bitterness to this porter really struck me. I would have it again if I saw it, but would look for other porters first.
POSITIVE	Founders is easily one of the best and most consistent breweries out there. All of their products are stellar and constantly deliver the goods. Double Trouble does not disappoint. Here is my review:  A: Pours a nice golden yellow. Pretty hazy with a rather small head. Lacing is okay. Looks pretty oily in the glass.   S/T: The aroma is hops all the way. Very grapefruity, with other citrus fruits present. Taste is excellent. Massive grapefruit presence. Grapefruit rind, lemon, and orange. There is some bready malts in the back, along with a slight alcohol sting. Very bitter and very delicious.  M/D: Mouthfeel is medium bodied and very oily. Very bitter finish with a good amount of dryness. Drinkability is great. I could drink a whole four pack in a sitting if I wanted.   I made a point throughout the whole review to avoid the Hopslam comparisons. Yes, the two are very similar. Loads of grapefruit hops and excellent balance. I find Double Trouble more bitter, more boozy, and more citric. Hopslam is more about balance and pure grapefruit hops. Both are easily some of my favorite IPAs, so I can't pick a clear cut winner. Either way, this beer is supurb and well worth checking out.
POSITIVE	Poured a 2010 bottle into my bruery tulip. Dark black with a 1finger mocha head that dissipates quickly. Nice lacing that clings to the glass like its glue. Aroma is coffee malt and light bourbon. I thought coffee fades out of beers quickly, I guess the coffee in KBS doesn't follow the rules. Man this beer tastes smooth, it follows the nose but is more balanced with a year on it, less hot and booze. I like it fresh but I love it with a year on it. Fantastic brew!
NEGATIVE	I agree with LongBeachBum's review below... this is a wonderful example of a Rauchbier, and if you love smoky tastes and creamy mouthfeel, this one will please you. If you don't appreciate a little experimentation in your beers, stay away.   All in all, I thought the nice hickory aroma was very appetizing, and it followed that the taste may be predominantly smoky. But, after a few sips, I could definitely make out the roasted malts as well as a bit of hop character. A very well balanced brew that is great for a few pints, but after that, you will probably want to move on to something else. That's not a knock, but rather, this is a specialty beer which really isn't intended for sessioning. :)
NEGATIVE	Presentation: 22 oz. bomber bottle opened for Game 1 of the Bruins playoffs. Poured into a Cigar City tulip glass and sipped throughout the game. Batch 5, Red Cap.  Appearance: Dark brown to black in color. Not much head on the pour and no retention.   Aroma: Really deep roasted notes, a touch of whiskey, espresso, and dark cherries. The char and roasted malt notes are almost too overpowering. I was expecting a lot higher level of sweetness.  Taste: The burnt, roasted character is definitely strong here too. I am finding it a bit too bitter to really enjoy. Whiskey notes are definitely present, but really light. And there is the cherry note again. It's actually really heavy and functions as the only really sweeet counterpoint to the char. It doesn't mix great with the rest of the notes though.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied and a touch chewy. A bit thiner than I would like from a barrel aged stout.  Overall, an interesting barrel aged stout, but fell way short of my expectations. The price tag didn't help either. The cherry note just didn't match eerything else for me and the smoke and roasted malt notes were bitter and unpleasant at times. Not a bad beer, but definitely on the lower end of the spectrum for the style (barrel aged stout) and way too pricey. Will not buy again.
POSITIVE	Big thank to hoppymeal. Derek added this AS AN EXTRA! You're a class act, bro.  22oz. brown bomber poured into a snifter.   A: Pours a deep mahogany, completely opaque. A short head forms and falls decently fast. Very little lacing.  S: Sweet malts with a pleasant alcohol line. A touch of smoky and meaty aromas.. like a touch of turkey dinner, herb rubbed and roasted game. There's a really unique mint aroma that fits very well.  T/M: Very different. The mint is very pronounced in the taste. Not unpleasant but just very unexpected. Hop bitterness is nearly gone and only has a touch of pine and citrus. The malts are sweet but not thick or syrupy. Again, just a touch of herb turkey/game. Alcohol comes out a bit about midway through and more as it warms. Body is only about medium to medium full and carbonation adds a bit of smoothness. Finishes a bit dry.  D: Tasty and extremely unique. The bottle says 13%. A bit surprising until about halfway through the bottle, lol. Keep up the good work, Founders.
POSITIVE	Pours a beautiful hazy amber/orange with a frothy one finger off-whitehead. Smells only of piercing, biting hops that easily rule the nose. First sip is a malt splash that very quickly turns in to a "slap your face" hoppy bitter finish. A strong malt backbone compliments the massive hops. Bitter from start to finish, this is a great IPA. Flawless and appreciated.
POSITIVE	Pours the blackest of blacks with a nice very dark tan head that dissipated quickly, leaving some nice lacing on the glass. The smell is great. It smells of Dark malts, chocolate, vanilla, bourbon, oak, and coffee. Tastes awesome. Coffee and chocolate, with the bourbon taste coming through well. There is also a nice sweetness to this beer that seems to stay in your mouth for a while. The mouthfeel is great for this type of beer. Very heavy body with low carbonation. Coats the mouth very well and really lets you taste the beer very well. The drinkability is very good with this beer even though it is definitely a slow sipper. It took me a long time to finish my glass of this, I had a great time doing it though. I really loved this beer and I think founders did a great job making it. This will be the perfect beer for the middle of winter. Great job founders. Cheers.
POSITIVE	The typical 500ML bottle came from one of my favorite breweries on the planet. This is, by far the one brewery I have left on my bucket list.   I was SO CLOSE to Bamburg (30KM) during my trip to Germany in 2002, but I never quite made it there. In any event, I've ru'ed the day. Let's move on.  The pour was so so. A little quaint head, but such a great appearance, I rated it very high. The head might have been better, but the golden clear soft amber begged to be tasted.  The nose on this beer rocks. I know that's not very scientific, so please indulge me for a moment. Faint apple (wood) smoke flavor with undertones of sweet cherry (wood) is forward. It's not ostentatious, but subdued and superb. I'm certain the malts were smoked with this wood. If not, I'll withdraw my membership in BA.  Beyond the nose, tasting this is exceptional. I rated a 4, but only because this is a Helles and somewhat less than the perfect Helles. Since this is my first smoked Helles, I may rescind this next week. Don't be discouraged.  The taste includes a nice malty flavor, contributing to the mouthfeel. Big and clean with a dry finish, I'm loving this. The balanced carbonation and somewhat subdued smoke flavor reveals a beer I'm so glad I finally found this. Although the hops were a bit subdued, hops are NOT the reason to buy this.   Smoke smell, silky smooth taste and feel, and drinkability are awesome. Ii can't imagine how to improve this, but it's possible it may happen.
POSITIVE	Founders Dirty Bastard is best served at warmer cellar temperatures (50-55F) from a small brandy snifter or Scottish thistle glass. This award-winning Strong Scotch Ale (Wee-Heavy) pours up with some authority along with a moderate carbonation that creates a low, short lived beige-light brownish colored head that sits proudly atop a deep auburn-russet body. The clarity is fairly bright with surprisingly good head retention and even shows some alcohol legs. The incredibly rich caramel aroma showcases the abundant maltiness with some intermingled fruitiness reminiscent of a bananas foster. In addition, there's a leafy, tobacco earthiness and peat smokiness which emerges as the beer warms in hand along with an intermingly of whisky notes that adds to the overall complexity. The malt dominated flavor starts off slightly fruity (plum preserves, raisin pie, ripened fig) with a rich, caramel maltiness that shows lots of kettle carmelization and carries a touch of oily smokiness. The chewy, full-body shows both power and grace with a big, bittersweet finish that packs plenty of warmth. This is just the tipple to add some color to the cheeks during a long winter's night. Here's to the old Dirty Bastard!   CHEERS! Beertracker
POSITIVE	Update: 3/25/10: I realized that the first time I reviewed this beer it was a bad bottle. Here is the revised review:  A: Slightly darker gold with about 3 fingers of foamy white head with large bubbles. Good head retention, no lacing.   S: Alcoholic, slightly sweet maltiness with notes of honey and tartness.   T: Slightly bitter, earthy and hoppy outset leads to a crisp maltiness which only hints at sweetness. Interesting, since the bitter hoppiness seems to come before the maltiness then prolong into the aftertaste.   M: Light and crisp with a somewhat dry finish.   D: Quite a unique brew (when fresh)... and I realized that I truly need to drink it fresh, otherwise I miss out completely on the subtleties of the flavor and it just kind of devolves into an astringent off-malt taste. If this is truly the "original" pilsner, then I wish more that came after it would emulate it.
POSITIVE	500 mL bottle pours a slightly hazed amber color with an ample off-white head. Fine-bubbled and long lasting. Nice...real nice.  Nose goes beyond bacon...lets go with whole smoked ham...double smoked! More smoky than the Ur-bock, which I did not think was possible. Not much else is noticeable, but thats ok for us smokeheads.  So smooth, yet so intense. Liquid smoke meets sweet malts and a kiss of alcohol. Body is light and I think that helps not make it too heavy-feeling of a brew. Pretty amazing brew and after a couple Schlenkerla brews that were not as smoky as Ur-bock, this one is damn smoky and enjoyable. Love it.
POSITIVE	poured from a bottle. pours orange amber with off white head that sticks around. smell is light citrus. taste is mild bitterness followed by a strong malt flavor and slight bitterness. perfect carbonation and swirls well. this is a more sessionable IPA. id like to see more hop presence. overall good stuff. their cask IPA is def more defined.
NEGATIVE	Pours dense black with a thick, full and firm rich pillowy head that looks like a chocolate malt.   Super light nose - almost non-existent; a mere hint of chocolate or maybe a hint of light red fruit.   Mouthfeel is thin and watery. No balance; no character; no body. Light carbonation.  Flavors are thin, weak and watery. In fact, it tastes a bit like coffee rinse water. No bad; just tastes like coffee water.   This bottle is purportedly from 2010. Hard to believe that a relatively new beer, identified as a porter could be so thin and weak. I'd try again just to confirm; perhaps the next batch will improve.
POSITIVE	This is a very nice English beer, a bit tart for a brown ale, but a nice beer nonetheless. Riggwelter means a sheep overturned, and hence the graphic on the label. The beer pours a dark clear ruby color with a very nice tan head that retains very well and laces. There is a creaminess to the head that seques into more of a foamy presence. The nose on the beer is sweet malts, some hop bite, some raisiny aromas as well. There is an earthy quality to this beer.   The taste is a tad musty, a full palate of roasted malts, some raisin like flavors, and an astringency that knocks things down a few points. There is a slight dryness in the finish, but overall this is a sweet roasted beer with some dark chocolate and charred flavors. The beer is more creamy than crisp, it has some hop leafy bitterness, and then there is the astringency. The mouthfeel is a tad oily and the aftertaste is quite noticeable roasted maltiness and bitterning hops. This beer is worth seeking out.  Re-review June 2010: This beer has a lot more caramel flavors, lots more malted toffee, and lots more pale malt flavors. There is less astringency for sure. There some leafy hop in the background, some very subtle charred flavors. This beer just got bumped up a notch. It is quite good.
NEGATIVE	12 oz bottle poured into a snifter  A: Dark brown, amber color with a moderate tan head that slowly retreats to a thin film and a ring of bubbles with very little lacing.  S: Toasted malt, old wood, caramel/butterscotch sweetness, slight alcohol burn. T: Sweet body that follows the nose. Strong malt body, toasted and butterscotch flavors. Surprisingly earthy. Slight alcohol taste/burn and also some fruitiness. M: Very creamy and smooth, minimal carbonation. Very soft on the tongue.  D: I actually prefer the bottled version to the draft. A little high in the alcohol to be very drinkable, also I'm not a big fan of Scotch ales, but this one of the best that I've had.
NEGATIVE	Barrel Aged Frosted Frog is a dark copper color. Its mostly clear, and has nice crimson highlights when held to light. A modest tan head caps it off. It stands roughly a finger tall, but recedes quickly. It holds at the surface for a bit. Lacing was a little sticky, but light.   The nose is alright. It features a strong cinnamon scent up front. No big shock there. There are some nice sweet, caramel and toffee notes that linger throughout. Bourbon is definitely there, but doesnt seem all that strong. Doesnt smell like it spent a great deal of time in barrels. Probably a good call. Other spicy notes of ginger and nutmeg are noted. Alcohol is there, but doesnt come through too strong.   The flavor is less impressive. Average at best. Caramel malts kick it off. The flavor is quite sweet. Its also quite spicy. Cinnamon comes through loud and clear. Its a bit overbearing. Ginger and nutmeg flavors are also present, but in lesser amounts. Bourbon is a little stronger in the mix than anticipated. Barrel aging also left a rather prominent vanilla flavor. The strong vanilla and cinnamon flavors seem to be a little at odds. Its not overtly bad, but its not quite good either. Alcohol is there, but isnt warm or hot.   The body is medium. Carbonation seems light and relatively soft. It has a pretty good feel. Its a sipper though. The flavor just grows a bit tiresome, especially in the second half of the bomber.   Barrel Aged Frosted Frog is not Hoppin Frogs best moment. Its okay at best. The flavor simply isnt very impressive. The vanilla and spicy notes are a little at odds with each other. Frankly, barrel aging did not have any appreciable positive effects on Frosted Frog. I prefer the regular, non-ba Frosted Frog. This one might be worth one try, but thats about it.
NEGATIVE	12 ounce can poure into a snifter. Purchased from Bear Creek Beers in Medford, OR for $1.65. Comes in at 6.1%. No bottling info is given.  A-Pours a fairly clear amber with orange and peach highlights. Has a 3/4 finger off white head that fades fast into a small filmy patch.  S-It is a tad weak in the nose. It almost seems like it was not dry hopped. It reminds me more of bittering hops. There is some grapefruit and pine as well as some biscuit malt and some caramel malt.  T-The first part of each sip is pretty good. There is a bracing level of grapefruit bitterness that hits fast. It is definitely earthy/herbal tasting with a tad bit of malt sweetness in the middle. It finishes with some medicinal flavor and leaves an aspirin aftertaste. It also feels a little roasty.  M-It is thinner bodied and the carbonation is fine. It has a roasty and dry aftertaste.  D-The medicinal/aspirin taste is not my thing.  It is hard to tell if this is how it is supposed to taste based on the fact that there is no bottling info on the can. I would only try this again if I knew it was fresh.
NEGATIVE	Poured from 12 oz bottle  This imperial IPA pours a deep dark amber with a very minimal head that dissipated rather quickly. Does leave a wispy lace on the glass.  Smell: Initial hints of sweet, fruity malt, apricots, caramel, and a slight hint of pine.  Taste: Starts with a sweet, caramel beginning that transitions to a dry hoppy middle. A pretty strong, hop finish leaves the mouth pretty dry. Alcohol fairly well hidden.  Mouthfeel: Pretty, thick and creamy. Fairly low carbonation.  Overall: A pretty decent Imperial IPA. A little sweet for my taste but not bad. High abv is a factor when drinking this beer, as are all imperal IPA's. Alcohol is pretty well hidden in the taste, but you can definitely feel its warming affects. Worth trying but there are others that are better.
NEGATIVE	Needed a beer to go with a fine delivery of Indian food, had this one ready to drink. A lovely circle of lace sits atop an amber body. Excellent retention. This one really made me want to drink it. Not sure what the picture on the bottle is. Maybe that is Rye Guy?  It smells like fruit and malts. Sweet. The taste features a bite of hops in the front, rye taste, and hops bitter in the back. Well composed, a bit sweet, a bit hoppy, balanced.  I'd come back for more in this session if this were my thing, because it is truly and solidly composed. But it's not. Still, it's the best rye beer I've tasted, and I could see myself being very happy to find another bottle for a food pairing.  Just maybe for a food that doesn't leave me so comatose as tonight's. Time to find some coffee.
NEGATIVE	This beer poured a deep, dark copper color with a nice off white head about 1 inch thick that disapated quickly. The smell was of toasted malt with a slight hint of hops. The taste was malty with caramel and a little spice and the mouthfeel was crisp in the beginning but kind of dulled in the end. This was a fairly drinkable Fest, but not the best I've had this year.
NEGATIVE	As a smoker this beer was not that good. It looked like a dark beer, but lurking inside was smoked meat and sweet breads. Seriously, I had some smoked sweet breads down in Argentina and this beer reminded my of what they tasted like. It had a strong smoked smell of campfire clothes, odd but enticing. It had a bitter charcoal hit to it as well that was not pleasing and a little bracing. There is some underlying sweetness but you can only taste them after your buds are readjusted to the smoke. Not bad enjoyable at times but have some cheese or something to gnosh on to make it more enjoyable as I found out half way through the galss.
NEGATIVE	Served in a Chicago Bears shaker pint glass.  I'm a ChiSox fan and quite the ticker. This is not a necessarily good combination when random, new, Sox-themed beers come about. This one arrived in my area a couple days ago. $1.79 for a 24oz can. Based on experience, this is not a good start. It pours a clear pale-ish golden straw topped by a finger of white, craggy foam. The nose comprises corn, flour, corn syrup, light biscuit, semi-sweet flowers, and grass. It's not too bad, so far. The taste, though, finally brings the quasi-expected storm: notes of corn syrup, sweetgrass, flowers, rice cake, honey, hard water, and fresh-from-the-cob corn. Wow, this stuff is somehow both sickly sweet and mineral-laden-ly vegetative. The body is a stolid medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a somewhat syrupy feel. Just like the taste, the feel is kinda oxymoronic, feeling both smoothly flowing and thickly stiff. I'm definitely not smiling with this stuff on my tongue. Overall, Big Frank said he wouldn't put his name on a bad beer. Looks like he was right: This is a downright crappy beer. Of course, with that ABV and the other options around, I'd probably still drink this at The Cell if the Sox don't start improving soon: Something's gotta take my mind off of the sadness on the field. Definitely sadness here in this can...
NEGATIVE	A - A thin yellow-gold color that was clear as many light lagers are. Head was nothing to write home about but it did leave a very very slight lacing.  S - Grainy. Not much.  T - Grainy with a slight hopiness. No malt to speak of here.  M - Crisp and carbonated but not as clean as some other light beers that I have tasted. Decent, nonetheless.  D - If you are the market for a light beer, this wouldn't be the worst choice you could make. Possibly a good thirst quencher.
POSITIVE	Bottle courtesy of mreusch. Pours a super cloudy dull orange with a huge, foamy white head. Aroma of tons of citrusy hops as well as floral hops and a touch of sweet pineapple and wheaty malt. Flavor is sweet and fruity, not very hoppy really. Quite delicious! I wish I could get this stuff all the time! 7/4/8/4/15 (3.8/5)
POSITIVE	I'd never heard of this beer but just decided to try it because I'm really into stouts right now. There are definite coffee and chocolate hints but it's not too sweet. A little thinner than some stouts but oddly, this doesn't bother me at all--just makes it more drinkable--in this case. Also, there's a little carbonation. Normally, I don't like carbonation much at all but again, this really works in this beer. Great overall. Looking forward to trying others from this brewery.
POSITIVE	Pours a beautiful orange citrus color. Smell immediately grabs your attention with wonderful aromas of full flavored hops, orange, and other citrus undertones.   Taste is what you should expect- a full bodied, strong, and nicely hopped India Pale Ale. Again, a bit of citrus on the finish.   A very enjoyable beer.
POSITIVE	500ml bottle poured into a Pint Glass.  Pours a dirty dark brown with a fluffy khaki-colored head that settles to a thick cap. Lovely smoke aromas that reminds me of wood-grilled salmon. Oily, spicy, and wonderfully meaty, this is a great smelling Rauchbier! Weizen flavors of banana and clove come through in the flavor, only to be swallowed up by more of that fishy smoke. I gotta admit, the Weizen backbone isn't as appealing to me as the more traditional Marzen, I just feel the caramel/malt flavors stand up to (and compliment) the smoke better. Still good, though. My qualms with the Weizen backbone carry through to the mouthfeel, I could definitely go for something a bit more substantial. As is, we're looking at a touch-under medium-bodied, slightly creamy, with moderately crisp carbonation. Overall a very solid addition to Schlenkerla's wonderful Rauchbier lineup, but certainly not my favorite.
POSITIVE	What is it about British Bitter? The impatient say "nothing" and indeed, upon first smell and taste of this marmelade colored ale with its fluffy white cap (in my glass at least) I do not sense much. But then the ever so slightly chewy mouthfeel taps me on the shoulder and beckons me to look again. British beer is most often as subtle as its citizenry, and here I seem to begin sensing a mineral quality beneath a layer of biscuity malt and a touch of fruit flavor that I can't put my finger on. Oh! I must be full of it now, and I started off sipping this beer in my sun room/ porch with a book on ancient China. I began to fall asleep, but the memory of my half drank glass woke me up to continue my studies - of the beer of course. I shut the book and came upstairs to share.
NEGATIVE	Pours a very deep clear brown/red with a fingerwidth off-white head that stays around for the ride.  Very interesting aroma of citrusy hops, burnt toast and biscuity malts.  Tastes like it smells, the toastiness is very noticeable along with a lemony zest, medicinal syrupy taste in the finish.  Very rich creamy and syrupy mouthfeeel. This is a very good brown ale, I have nothing to complain about here.
POSITIVE	Poured into a large snifter.  Appearance: This pours a hazy amber color with copper overtones. The head is about one and a half fingers tall, and it dissipates to leave a layer of foam on the brew. This brew leaves strong lacing on the edges of the glass. This is a good looking beer.  Smell: The sweet smell of caramel-like malts is the first thing I detect. There is also a slight floral character as well. Nothing complicated here, but it is pleasant.  Taste: Starts slightly bitter, which quickly gives way to a ton of malty sweetness. The flavor gives way to a little bit more of hoppy bitterness, and has a metallic-style finish. Overall, I wasn't really expecting this kind of taste from an ale. It reminds me more of a darker lager. It's good, although I don't find anything terribly special about it.  Mouthfeel: A medium thickness, with minimal carbonation. It feels good on the tongue.  Drinkability: The alcohol content is low, and the taste is unobtrusive. If the drink weren't so expensive, it'd be easy to drink a few of these.  Given the price, I was somewhat underwhelmed by this. If you like English Pale Ales, you may want to try this. I can't really consider myself a fan of the style.
NEGATIVE	I picked this up at the Drafting room, shared w/ carlos and evets on separate occasions. Poured chilled into a willybecker.  A - A light amber/straw golden hued ale w/ 1/4 inch of white cap that leaves sticky lace. The light color is slightly out of the ordinary for Double IPA's and I like it. It has a crescent moon for head and the clarity is lightly hazed w/ minute bubbles  S - Sweet + crisp w/ grapefruit scent high in the aroma w/ moderate scent of alcohol. The nose warns of pine cone type hops w/ yeasty esters which are fruity   M - the feel is sweet upfront w/ moderate bitterness apropos to style w/ med high acidity and bitterness. The texture stays sweet and has a warming finish w/ residual smooth resinous note with the bitterness lasting  T - A light sweet crystal tinged malt mixed w/ grapefruit and pine upfront w/ acidity and mild malt in the taste w/ light alcohol taste increasing as it warms w/ gentle dry malt flavors. The citrus and herbal hops bring the bitter intensity to this flavor w/ a gentle pine cone accent and mild grassiness. A nice warmth of alcohol and mild sweet light malt w/ an intensely bitter strong finish  D - Not the most drinkable DIpa, but certainly delivers the hops in an extreme way no question. It goes big or goes home. A great IIPA just very tasty and fits the west coast style well.
NEGATIVE	It poured a nice mahogany color, with a nice head which had a good retention.  Aromas of cedar first, then, roasted coffee to finish with cane syrup.  Low carbonation feel on the tongue, with a nice bitter start that finished a little milder, with notes of caramel.  A decent brew all in all.
POSITIVE	Love the label....it's like an 80's Metal Band logo.  Pours a deep black w/ just a hint of light passing through...less than a half finger of head, light brown in color and disappears almost immediately. Very minimal lace and what sticks to the glass, vanishes just as quickly.  The smell is great...a sweet vanilla and coffee burst in the nostrils.  Taste is very unique...it is sweet, but dry and a touch bitter. The malt is a smack in the face w/ just a hint of hop. I can taste a dark roast coffee in here that is very clean and refreshing.  The mouthfeel is well balanced and this could easily become a session beer. Too bad I only picked up one.  Another great beer from Founders...I would highly recommend this beer.
POSITIVE	Drank 11/5/11  A: A slightly reddish amber hue, with a head that dissipates quickly and completely. Intriguing simply because it's a different color.   S: It smells like an orange chocolate bar. Not what I was expecting at all, but I like it. Not the most exceptional or complex beer I've had, but it's good.  T: Again, orange chocolate. Mmm mmm good. Very well balanced, and not a hint of booze.   M: Good intermediate body, but nothing special.   O: I enjoyed this beer, but I much prefer Caldera's other offerings.
POSITIVE	A: A light copper with yellow tones. Head sticks around for a while and retreats to a thin white ring of frothy, small white bubbles.  S: The smell is out of this world. Very piney and citrusey along with a delicate sweetness from the malts. A few swirls in my Duvel tulip and the citrus and pines come through much stronger. Slight alcohol aroma.  T: Puckering citrus notes, grapefruit and lemon. Tart at first, then the malts come through. Ends with a very floral hop taste.  M: Creamy and bubbly. Has a fizzy mouth feel while on the tongue, but smooths out as the malts take over.  D: With such a high ABV this would not be a beer you could have more than 3 or 4 of. Very drinkable with a nice spicy food, but not a sessionable beer for sure.
NEGATIVE	On tap at the Bayou (where it's listed as "UPA")  Golden yellow with sparkling carbonation and a small, fluffy, white to off-white head. Nose is basically biscuits and light fruit, but it is mostly hoppy: resinous and herbal. This was definitely dry-hopped. The hop wall is nice, but it's a bit lop-sided without out some beefier malt. Same goes for the taste. All Columbus-style hops. Very little malt. I kind of like the fresh hop onslaught, but I need some f***ing malt! Unsurprisingly light-bodied with effervescent carbonation. Refreshing and good for a hop fix.
POSITIVE	12oz bottle into a regular snifter. 08-09 winter release. 10.5 %, 90 IBU's. I've been waiting for this for two years & it's finally here, I'm in heaven.  A- Founders IS comes out black from the bottle and is even blacker when condensed in the glass. A very thick looking brew with some tannish bubbles trying to form a head but fail. Just traces of foam here and there condensing towards the middle. Some dots of lace are seen on the glass. Again this is very dark and deep, no getting around it. If i wanted to get even with somebody i would pour this on their favorite garmet.  S- Wow at the malts giving off a creamy vibe with some coffee/chocolate mix following. A lot of roast coming from the malt and coffee as well. Was not expecting any hops but are noted in the smell. Out of all the dark brews founders releases this imperial stout takes a backseat in terms of over-exposure & a nice change. Very mellow nose for such a number of ingredients & IBU range.   T- The roasted and charred character is ever present with the coffee and malt mix. This is evened out with the chocolate malts & others while the hops come through leaving some bitterness taste. Some oatmeal as well. Seeing this is at 90 IBU's i can understand. Some woody character and slight dark fruits on the end. This stout also is on the hot side initially but it adds to the appeal. I know the alcohol is there but I cant pick it up at all giving IS more pluses.   M- Coats the mouth is an understatement, as this glides throughout leaving a slickness & some hottness which i'm diggin at the moment and that's unusual.. Leaving this around for a while is no problem to absorb all th flavors. I'm liking the slight tingle the hops give off. Medium to full bodied for sure, i drank this one way to quick as it's not to sweet or overbearing amazingly. Alcohol does not get in the way although it's felt.  D- With all the complex flavors and a 10.5 ABV this is will be an occasional rarity for me as one was enough. Don't get me wrong as I could drink 2 or 3 but I would rather savor it as this is quite limited. I could see FIS aging nicer than it's family members Breakfast & Kentucky as it's brewed with more of the conventional ingredients without the coffee or bourbon profiles to keep up.   Another one out of the ball park for Founders as they keep it coming with stellar releases. I suggest if you have the access to this seek it out immediately. Now Black Rye is the only release i need before I complete their bottled line up, here's to hoping.
POSITIVE	Poured a deep dark amber, very clear with lots of streaming carbonation from the bottom of the glass, but no head. Slight amount of lace. Smell was very bready and grain like, with a hint of a slight bitterness, but definatly bread like. The flavor followed suit as it was highly malted and full of grain like flavors. Not much hops to balance, but ever so slightly dry finish. Kinda thin in feel, not enough carbonation to give it that silky smooth feel. Overall this was a decent offering from foothills, and an average representation of the style. The alcohol is very, I mean very well hidden, I could swear this was a 4% beer, was shocked to see it at 8% before my review. Overall definatly give this one a try if you can.
POSITIVE	The beer is mildly hazy and appears orange to copper in color. The head is off white hued, measuring approximately an inch thick. A substantial amount of lacing is left on the glass.  The aroma offers malt, alcohol, oak, vanilla, banana, and rum.  The flavor is strong and complex. As prefaced in the nose, alcohol, malt, and banana are the prevalent flavors. The beer is still a bit hot, and could likely benefit from some cellar time.  The feel is medium-heavy on the palate, with alcohol content noticeable throughout. Carbonation is moderate.  Overall, a decent brew from a great brewery. This one is a good candidate for sharing a few ways.
POSITIVE	served from a 12oz. bottle into a tulip glass  Body pours a cloudy, peach color that was lighter than I expected. The voluminous, bright white head was rocky like sea foam; a solid base topped off with a tiny flourish of bubbles at the top. Head this fabulous typically has excellent lacing, and the dynamic crests of lace left by Founders Double Trouble is not an exception.  Typical IIPA aromas from this beer. More citrus than pine, but rest assured that both make their presence felt. They are overpowering, really. I can't make out much of a malt presence in the smell, but whatever.  Oh, yes. This hits the spot. Bold, juicy citrus flavors abound in this beer. Citrus is the first and most defining impression you will get from Double Trouble. Its mostly grapefruit, nothing too tropical, but there is something else there that I want to say is Fiji apple. There is some light caramel malt. This is a wildly unbalanced beer. Just like I like IIPAs, frankly. A gentle kiss of pine makes the finish not as bitter as perhaps desired. There is very little lasting bitterness and the "hop burps" are not as good as they should be given how hoppy the initial blast of flavor is.  This is on the thin side of mouthfeel, which is a good thing when considering the juicy, citrusy quality of the flavors. The mouthfeel confirms what my tastebuds thought in that there is essentially no attempt to give this a significant malt background. Double Trouble as an ABV approaching 10% but its light body and juicy nature make it a darn drinkable drink.  My personal preferences in double IPAs lean towards the unbalanced ones. I love hop overloads, specifically grapefruit flavor overloads. Founders Double Trouble gives me that. I'll be picking up some more, for sure.
POSITIVE	Oily black pour with a tan head. Aroma of dark chocolate, hazlenut, roasted malt, earthy hops, toffee and coffee. Flavors of rich dark chocolate, booze soaked dark fruits, coffee, caramel, bitter/earthy undertones. Thick body, rich/roasty/bittersweet and satisfying throughout with a bitter/roast finish. Overall, there are two porters that tie for my favorite. This and Edmund Fitzgerald. They both kind of go beyond of what I usually get from this style. This is one amazing brew, theres lots of beers double in strength that fail to capture its focus and flavor.
POSITIVE	Pint consumed for $4 at the Porterhouse Pub in Mount Vernon.   This was a copper color with an inch of white foam. Decent amount of lace.   This was mostly malty in the nose, with a mild, floral hop scent. The malts are not over the top sweet, but just right, giving a slightly caramel scent to theproceedings.   Like the smell, the taste of this beer is geared more toward the malty end of the spectrum. It's not a sugary malt bomb, however. There's a little bit of a hop twang, but this is the malt's show.   Medium bodied, with a well-carbonated mouthfeel. There wasn't any flatness issues like the ones I see mentioned in some of the other reviews.   A very sessionable beer, I could easily see myself partaking in the consumption of a pitcher of this.
POSITIVE	Bloody mahogany that isn't quite opaque when weak winter sunshine is allowed to enter the glass. I've decided to cut it a little slack since it is a porter, not a stout. The upper quarter of the glass is filled with a tight-bubbled head of brown sugar colored foam that looks pretty good. Thick sheets of sudsy lace get it done as well.  Even though no ABV is listed, RIP probably has a high-ish ABV (hence the name). The good thing about the aroma is that almost no alcohol is appreciated. The slightly less good thing is that the beer smells like a good (non-Imperial) American porter. Dark caramel and cocoa lead the way.  Russian Imperial Porter tastes at least as good as it smells, and possibly even better. Let's see what warming and many more mouthfuls have to say about the final outcome. What in the world does '210' mean? Why the mysteriousness? The BBC website is no help at all.  The beer really does taste more like an American porter than a stout. Maybe it's the lack of roasted maltiness and coffee. That doesn't mean, however, that it's short on flavor. Far from it. Chocolate-covered caramel mixed with molasses gets it about right. There's also a candied white grapefruit tanginess that is undoubtedly coming from hops that were born in the U.S. of A.  Warming brings an expansiveness to the flavor profile and the mouthfeel. In addition, the alcohol is beginning to warm the belly and numb the tongue. I'll guess an ABV in the vicinity of 10.0%. It's impossible to tell based on flavor, however. Great job guys.  What started as a medium mouthfeel is now at least medium-full. The silky smoothness is probably the result of plenty of malt and dead... solid... perfect... carbonation. The next highest score is just out of reach.  Other than Hell For Certain, I haven't had very good luck with Bluegrass beer packaged in 750 ml bottles. Russian Imperial Porter 210 gets things back on track. This is one of those beers that is (slightly) better than the final score would indicate. Might this be a bigger version of the outstanding Dark Star Porter?
NEGATIVE	Pours out an Ice tea color slightly murky with one finger of off-white suds. Lacing is good here. Smell is lemon and pine. Yeast burns the nose and some sugary malt is noticeable after swirling a bit. Taste is bitter from the get-go. Christmas tree and grapefruit with a bitterness that sets on the back of the tounge and refuses to leave. The Alcohol is pretty evident here but it seems to be balanced with all the bitterness. I haven't had too much experience with triple IPA's. This seems to be a pretty nice one though. Mouthfeel is very oily and the bitter sticks in the back but that is a good thing.  With a 13% abv it would not be advisable to drink lots of this all at once. Not a bad beer at all from Founders.
NEGATIVE	Presentation: Sampled at Fernandes Brewery Tap in Wakefield, West Yorkshire. Plain white rectangular pumpclip has the words Goldie Hops. Listed at 3.4% ABV.  Appearance: Pale golden yellow with creamy white body as it settled, highly carbonated. Once at rest the bleached white head which had a finger thick tight creamy head with good retention throughout.  Nose: Biscuit malts in the background but lots of hops and floral aspects. Refreshingly crisp with an overall character that is very fruity.  Taste: Delicate to say the least, feint whiffs of hops and a little sweet Munich like malts. Its all very low key, weak flavors and a taste profile that seems watered down.   Mouthfeel: Whilst the conditioning was perfect it could not do anything to offset the very thin body and weak feel that the Goldie Hops presented.  Drinkability: A 3.4% brew is typically pitched nicely into the Session arena, but this one is a little too thin and the tastes far too weak to maintain interest in the long term.   Overall: Im a big fan of Fernandes beers, indeed, I spent many hours drinking their fines wares when I lived in England, but this one was a disappointment. Just to thin and not enough hops.
POSITIVE	Had this on tap at O'Brien's a couple of times this past week. Poured in a pint glass almost jet black with a small light brown head.  Smells rich and roasty of dark malt, slightly burnt with notes of dark bitter cocoa and coffee.  The flavor is roasted malt, fairly bitter like a dry Irish Stout with a bit more kick. It's got a little strange funky flavor to it that I noticed in their Barleywine, but can't find the proper words to describe it...it's not bad, just unusual.  Good bit of body to this one, mild carbonation and a nice dry finish. I definitely recommend this to those who have not been impressed with brews produced South of the border...good stuff.
POSITIVE	This beer poured a deep oily black with virtually no head. The aroma was simply robust coffee (well there might be a hint of roasted malt and slight fruit). The taste is strong of coffee with some possible raisin flavors. The mouthfeel if full and the finish is slightly oily - a bit of an alcohol burn is noticed at the end. This is an easy to drink beer. It is almost like an alcoholic coffee, but it goes down smooth.  Edit: I drank another bottle that I had gotten at the same time about a week later. The second bottle was more complex and interesting. The aroma had more of a bourbon note to it - I'm raising the score by 0.5 simply for the smell.
POSITIVE	Thank you, Alex!  Jet black with a thin, brown head with rather poor retention and lacing, this still manages to retain more than a modicum of attractiveness. Beer goggles? The nose is excellent. Vanilla, bourbon, chocolate, a little leather, cocoa, coffee and plenty of raisin, this is great stuff. A touch earthy too? The palate opens with chocolate, coffee and bourbon and plenty of heat. Alcohol, vanilla, chocolate are present. This is super smooth, much like an oatmeal raisin cookie. Sweet finish with medium roast, this is a great beer.
POSITIVE	Pours a deep dark black, very opaque, small but thick tan head forms and laces all over the glass. Smell is very roast, coffee, floral hops, some alcohol and vanilla. Taste is coffee and chocolate, caramel, and a bitter roastiness. Mouthfeel is full bodied, low carbonation and silky smooth, amazing stout! Thanks DrJay.
POSITIVE	8/25/2006 $4.00 12 oz. 11.00% Bottled April 2006.   Appearance:  Pours a pitch black that lets absolutely no light through. Topped by a quarter or so inch of dark tan that settles rapidly. No legs to speak of, but since this isn't an RIS, that's ok.   Aroma:  Wisps of smoked peat, coffee and a touch of chocolate dominate. I can't detect the notes of vanilla and oak one would expect from something aged in bourbon barrels.   Taste/Mouthfeel:  Excellent smooth mouthfeel, consistent with a milk stout. Nice notes of roasted coffee complete with cream. A touch of smoke in the finish along with mild hop bitterness. Some alcohol is barely detectable in the finish, perhaps imparted by the bourbon barrels? Otherwise I get no impression of bourbon out of this one, which is fine by me, since I don't really care for bourbon.  While this was enjoyable, and quite tasty, I can't get past the price. I paid $4.00 for a single, while the 4 pack was discounted to $15.00. Not worth the price IMHO.
POSITIVE	Thanks to tyrawlings for the bottle.  Appearance: Bright red-orange body, nice looking head, streams of carbonation.  Smell: Very big hops in the nose, sweet and resinous. Pineapple, oranges, cotton candy. What a fantastic nose. The hops are showcased perfectly.  Taste: Not as intensely hopped as the nose. Now that I check the bottle I see it is dry hopped, and that makes sense. The hops are strong, but it is more balanced than I was anticipating.  Drinkability: Body is a little undercarbonated. Other than that, I will reall enjoy this bottle of beer.
POSITIVE	Hazy mahogany, theres only a sprinkling of a head, and it's gone before I can sit down with it. No lacing, no bubbles. It just sits there being lame, but with the ABV, it's forgiven.   There's some initial spicy booze notes. A tinge of caramel, and booze soaked white grapes. There's also other fruity esters such as plum and raisins. Definitely spicy and astringent.   Taste is rather pleasant, sweet malts, darker fruits, caramel, and a hint of hops maybe that is attributing to a slight sharp taste at the end...seems almost tropical. The finish is also where the warming alcohol comes into play. It's however nicely subtle.   Feel is medium bodied, very little carbonation, and creamy.  Good drinkability, mighty tasty, and a well hidden alcohol. This doesn't have to be a sipper.
NEGATIVE	Thanks to zealot for this suprise beer in a trade, I think.  Pours a thick Honey Brown with lots of floaties in this bottle. Didn't know or look out to see sediment.   Smells like an old ale but kinda boozy. Like the drunk at the bus stop.  This might not be fair because all those yeasty floaties are giving it a very bitter taste??!! Not too good in my book.   I think this might not be too fair because the beer may have been poured wrong, but good beer should be idiotproof. The more I drink the worse it gets, so it might not be me. No soup for you!
NEGATIVE	Appearance- dark black with very think tan head off the pour, nice appearance for the style  Smell- lots of coffee, some hops and roasted malts, not overwhelmed by the smell but not bad  Taste- Nice flavor but to me still a bit strong in the coffee department though not to level of their breakfast stout, alot of hoppy bitterness on this one this one with slight heat, balance not perfect but not bad  Mouthfeel- heavy with moderate carbonation  Drinkability- Decently drinkable though I truely was not ultra blown away by this stout by any means, just lacking that little something special that makes you really love a great stout, a good beer but not great
POSITIVE	This IPA pours a murky dark honey-amber with a slight tint of crimson, and it is topped off with a thick, fluffy, caramel-colored head which, when it receded, left a frothy lacing. The aroma is of fine tangy hops offset by a sweet key-lime underpinning. The taste is slightly smoky and definitely sweeter than I expected--much maltier than most American IPAs; it has that buttery English texture. There is subtle citrus in the finish, and it has a surprisingly thin, but smooth, mouthfeel.
POSITIVE	Appearance= Nice head, came up fast and stayed for a while. Color is yellow, little on the dark side, I would guess 4-5 SRM. Bubbly  Smell= Definitely got a biscuity aroma coming off the head with a little bitter metal aroma as well. Possibly a hint of sweetness tosses in there too.  Taste= Light malt taste, the focus is on the hops which are sour with again a little bit of that metallic taste going on. That same hop flavor continues into the short finish  Mouthfeel= Well carbonated, thin but not watery, quite nice.  Drinkability- Light, peppy, and very drinkable, could see myself downing a few. I can see how this got watered down to make the beers I used to drink back in the day
NEGATIVE	Got this while driving from PA back through to Cincinnati at West Point Market in Akron, Ohio. Per the employee at the store, this ale is only distributed in the Akron area, but I'm not certain I believe that 100%.  Appearance: No freshness date seen. Poured from a bomber it my traditional pint glass. Pour a clear, bright pale yellow with the slightest tinge of purple, definitely a unique look. A brief, ultra-white fizzy head disappeared quickly leaving what looks like a flat 7up. No other carbonation lingered.  Smell: Smells like a super-sweetened raspberry, not natural. Further sniffing brings the slightest wheats or bready malts.  Taste: Flat! This is beer? Wow, to me it tasted like a flat cream soda with no bite whatsoever. Vanilla, craminess and the slightest artificial candied raspberry flavor detected. What was this, a flat raspberry Zima?  Mouthfeel: Flat and wet, no dryness detected. No carbonation. Blah...  Drinkability: Sorry, no thanks. I'm glad I had the opportunity to try it for the sake of getting another fruit/vegetable beer review under my belt, but I won't be getting this one again.
POSITIVE	12oz bottle into a tulip:  A: Yellow to gold in color with a two finger white head. Great retention with a ton of lacing, great clarity.  S: No question about what style this is, funky pine and citrus come wafting from the glass. The yeast makes it's presence known with a hint of strong booze.  T: The taste does not let down. Hops are in the forefront, piney, resinous, and citrusy with a touch of spiciness. The back side is slightly boozy with a hint of toast. Dry and bitter on the finish.  M: Full bodied and well carbonated.  D: This a quite a drinkable DIPA in my opinion, wonderfully piney and tropical funky.
POSITIVE	I enjoyed this change of pace. Not too sweet, the natural sweetness of cinammon is well blended by ginger's pungency, and some spice from nutmeg. Ginger is usually off-putting to me, with few exceptions. This was one. Too much for one to finish the bomber. The mouthfeel is easy, and it is not thick. The beer smelled winter warmer.May have enjoyed it more at a supper.
POSITIVE	Batch #2, 2009 vintage, poured into nonic.  A - Pours black with a fingers worth of tan colored head. Some lacing, no retention.   S - Slight bourbon, vanilla, chocolate, toffee.  T - Same as nose...milk chocolate, malts, caramel, vanilla.  M - Full, rich and smooth, slight carbonation.  D - So smooth but I think I prefer regular BORIS.
POSITIVE	Pours a dark brown, it can look black if the light's not so good. The head poured out to a couple fingers deep, and lasted an acceptable time before lacing down.   Smell is slightly better than average all things considered. There's a slight carbony character that I find distracting and mildly unpleasant. Otherwise the malt is nice, and there's also something that I can describe best as unsweetened baking chocolate. Hop aroma noticable but not notable. In the flavor the carbony part becomes more pleasant. The hops are more prominent than they were in the smell, and while hardly knockdown-strong, they provided a pleasant extra bitterness and balance to the malt and roasted barley, which are fairly standard.   Carbonation is moderate and the mouthfeel is creamy. This seems to me to lose some mouthfeel as temp approaches the mid-high 50's, so I like to drink this one a bit colder than other porters. Everything comes together very well. It has flavor but not doesn't demand undivided attention like a lot of other good beers; it goes down extremely smooth, I could drink this all night.
POSITIVE	22 oz. Dark gold/orange pour, a nice layer of whitish head. Retains well, laces ok.  Herbal and resiny pine mainly in the aroma. A little spiciness to it as well. Barely a hint of malt.  Taste has more going on than I thought it would. Herbal piney hops, only mild grapefruit. Burnt toffee, brown sugar. A spiciness to it again, with just the faintest onion powder. Nothing like Gubna though. Finishes with quite a bitterness and fairly dry and clean.  Medium bodied, carbonation brings prickliness to the mouth. A little harsh, but some of that is from the spicy nature I think. The abv is not really present and not real warming either.  Interesting, probably wouldn't get it again, but another solid brew from the Frog.
NEGATIVE	I've had this ale several times in the past and remember it fondly, so I though I'd do a review this time around. In doing so, I learned something about this brew that I hadn't realized before.  As usual this ale poured an ample three fingers of cream colored head which comprised both fine and medium sized bubbles. The head had descent staying power. There was a slight turbidity to the beer with an apparent yeast halo in the glass. There was nice lacing throughout my drinking occasion.  The aroma was of resinous hops, malt and ripe fruit (apricot?).  The flavor was piny hops, fruity yeast, alcohol, brown sugar and bourbon. There is a nice bitter/sweet balance with alcohol and malt sweetness and hop bitterness. The flavor is strong and robust. It is very appealing upfront ... but, there is a very strong bitter aftertaste to this ale which I had never noticed until now. Coming from a person who loves intense IPA's this is an unusual comment.  Drinkability is average to below average due to the aftertaste I previously mentioned. In addition, the ABV. would likely limit mass consumption of this ale at a single seating. Still, not a bad beer to enjoy from time to time.
POSITIVE	Huge head, almost out of control. Took about 8 pours to get it all in there. Apricot colored body. Just off-white head. Slowly works its way down in lumps becoming as thick as mouse.  Piney citrus hops throughout. Very fruity, even some hints of lemon coming out. Feels like it cleanses the nostrils as I inhale the hop aromas.  Nicely balanced brew. Lots of caramel maltiness. Pine hops really dominate throughout. Only initially bitter then goes down smooth leaving only a hint of flavor upon the tongue. Sweetness pervades the senses a little longer. Finishes with a bit of earthyness. Lots of flavor for an IPA, with a bit more bitterness this could stand up to many DIPAs out there. A bit of alcohol sneaks its way in as well. Reminds me of a Stoudts DIPA but without the alcohol level and bitterness.  Full bodied. Coats the mouth well. A bit too much carbonation as evident by the overwhelming head. Drinkability is good. The flavor seems a bit up front. I'm a hop head but I don't see me having too many of these in a row. A good one per night IPA.
POSITIVE	On tap at Horse Brass, 7.9.2010, $4.75 imperial pint.  One finger creamy white head, medium-fast dissipation with some lacing. Reddish amber clear body, no visible carbonation. The nose is spicy, piny hops and caramel malts, battling for attention, nicely balanced. Taste is a bit of malty sweetness upfront, firm malt backbone in the middle, and a lingering fairly bitter resiny hop finish. Mouthfeel is pretty full, not much effervescence, fairly dry, resiny and a bit sticky. There is some pretty serious hoppiness in play here, not overly bitter. Looking forward to comparing this with the bottled version.
POSITIVE	I thought this was a novelty beer, which I rarely think of trying. I love Monty Python so I decided to give it a try. I was very delighted with the taste. It went well with meatloaf and baked potato meal I made last night. I would definitely recomend this ale.
POSITIVE	Thanks to Dan and John of the Dan and John Beer Page for giving me a 16.9 bottle of this wonderful beer  Reminscent of Paulaner Munich Lager; it is a very light lager with mellow but assertive hops. Subtly smooth with no harshness.   A triumph of the gentle touch.
POSITIVE	Pours a clean golden color with a white head that does not last. Aromas of a European hp and a sweet malt. Tastes about the same with with a dry end. Not much of an aftertaste, but a good palate clensor. Easy to drink, good for a game. Light and refreshing.
NEGATIVE	The aroma invites sweetness, there is initial caramel sweet followed up immediately by all IPA-level hops. Big malty head. A good bitterness. Amarillo and summit hops. A bit of toasted malt.Smooth drinking with suitable carbonation.Fresh and satisfying.
NEGATIVE	Got a good 12 oz-er bottled in January 2006. Pours a hazy, bourbon color with a small, white good. Pretty good retention. Sweet aromas: toasted barley, caramel, molasses, wood, bourbon. Nice taste to it: the bourbon again, caramel, woody, like drinking a decent bourbon with a barley center. Slight fizz on the mouthfeel, but overall nice. A decently drinkable beer, nice and easy, although not exceptional.
POSITIVE	I poured this beer into a stella artois glass.  Its appearance whas the plae golden hue I expect from beers of this sort. I didn't get much smell from it. Perhaps my nose is too stuffed up at the moment. Or perhaps its just not working...or perhaps the beer doesn't put off much smell.  I like this taste. I has a hint of hops, not the kind in the pale ales I enjoy but a hint none the less. Its a sharp crisp taste that finished nicely. I like this beer after I have done alot of physical labor. Its kinda like drinking water, but its better than drinking water because it has all the nice things a beer has in it. The mouthfeel is kinda spritzy. I think that is the best way to describe it. It has a carbonation to it that is spritzy when you drink it cold.   I think this is quite a drinkable beer.
POSITIVE	22 oz bomber bought for me by a friend at Jungle Jim's by a friend of mine. Poured into a Terrapin 22 oz snifter.  A: Pours a jet black and appears completely flat when you initially start pouring. A beautiful brown head rises slowly as you finish pouring. Unfortunately, it disappears much faster than in rose. The small ring of bubbles left behind tries to leave lacing behind, but it doesn't stick to the slanted sides of the glass. The score would be higher if I judged in on those few seconds with the head.  S: Huge roasted malt aroma. There is a bit of chocolate aroma as well. It smells very good.  T: Wow, what a bold yet smooth flavor. Chocolate roasted malt flavors typically are more aggressive than this. Is there oatmeal in there making it this smooth? The hops are just enough to balance what would otherwise be a very sweet beer. The alcohol is very well hidden in this one. It is a very tasty stout for sure.  M: This is a very full bodied beer. It almost seems like you could chew it. Nice level of in mouth carbonation gives it a creamy feeling as well.  D: This one is a bit of a sipper due to its thickness and full body. However, there are many RIS beers that are much more aggressive than this one. For the style, its an easy drinker.
POSITIVE	Poured into a sifter, it has a jet black, almost oily appearance. Very slight brown head dissapears almost immediately. Decent lacing. Looks the part of a big ass IS, I just wish it retained a little bit of the head though.  Smell is a lot of sweet malt up front. Comes through a lot better for me than in a lot of other examples of the style. Coffee/Chocolate is there, but relatively muted... overall probably one of the more pleasant "sweet" smells i've found in a beer.  Taste is subtly sweet upfront, slightly bitter chocolate/coffee in the middle, and finishes with a little hop bite in the end to offset the sweetness (make no mistake though, this is not a "hoppy" stout). A wonderfully blended taste where it really feels like all the flavors have come together. No "off" flavors at all, and none of the slight lactic/sour finish I get in some Imp. Stouts.   Mouthfeel is the real standout here. Incredibly smooth and creamy without feeling too heavy. For the size of this beer, it is very easy to drink, and in that sense i think it is really the benchmark for the style. Never feels boozy or hot.  As a whole, this might be my favorite "normal" Imp. Stout. It drinks incredibly smooth, is sweet without being sticky, is creamy without being overly heavy, and blends together the traditional Imp. Stout flavors as well as any other example of the style I can think of. I was quite happy to be able to buy this beer for 10 a 4pack, I just wish there was more of it to buy. Drink this beer!!
NEGATIVE	This is a very malty sweet beer tastes more like an amber or brown. It is not true to the IPA style the sweet alcohol flavor dominates. Even for a DIPA it is syrup not much hop flavor. I would not buy this beer again.  A - good amber color S - ok mostly sweet alcohol  T - sweet and boozy  M - thin light carbonation D - low at 10% and too sweet and cloying
POSITIVE	Pours an orangish gold in appearance out of the bottle. Smell is wonderful of very piney hops. Head rises two fingers and is very white and pillowy in appearance. First sip reveals a slightly grapefruit hops profile with a very soft water background. This makes the mouthfeel creamy. This makes the second Founder's beer I've found with this creamy mouthfeel. A trademark of theirs perhaps with the local water? A little too bitter to be extremely high in drinkability. A very good beer. Founders is deserving of some good publicity.
NEGATIVE	Appearance- Very dark and robust. Forms a nice creamy head that dissipates   Smell- Definite notes of the roasted and chocolate malts. Very inviting.  Taste- Has a bittering taste upfront that transitions to a very smooth aftertaste. Very light and creamy on the palate for the last 2/3 of a drink. Lots of chocolate malt notes in the taste. Very full favored yet with an easy after taste.  Mouthfeel- A little harsh and ever so slightly unbalanced. Probably the low point for me on this either wise outstanding porter.  Drinkability- Very good. You can easily drink two or three of these in one session.  Overall - Very good example of this style. Definitely a little more bittering then some examples of porter but I really like the overall experience. Another very good beer from the Founders folks.
POSITIVE	A. Pitch black, not even a sign of any highlights around the edges. A dark tan head that dissipates slowly and leaves some nice rings around the edges. The perfect look?   S. Wow, this is the most coffee and chocolate I think I've ever smelled in a beer. The mocha scent is deep and very rich.   T. Unbelievably, this may be the weak point of this beer. It is labeled as an oatmeal stout but I'm not sure I get that. The bittersweetness of good oatmeal stouts like St. Ambroise, Barney Flats, and Sam Smith's is absent. It still tastes great, but just not quite like a proper oatmeal stout. Perhaps it's the absence of this that makes me slightly disappointed in the flavor. Still, this is a very nice tasting brew. Initially the mocha/chocolate flavors dominate. Very rich, dark, and quite good. The finish is marked by a drying bitterness that is much more reminiscent of the coffee than beer. Add that to the fact that the high alcohol content(8.3%) is hidden better than any other beer I've tasted of this strength and you really do have a fantastic "breakfast stout."   M. Thick, chewy, and almost devoid of carbonation. Not quite as creamy as I would've liked.   D. As mentioned, for such a strong beer in terms of alcohol, it is amazingly drinkable. I mean, I can't even perceive it. The roasted bitterness is also restrained just enough that it doesn't take a toll on your taste buds. Quite amazing to see a beer like this that is so drinkable.
NEGATIVE	Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a weizen glass.  Appearance: Decent carbonation for the style. Hazy golden yellow with a modest white head that doesn't last for long.  Smell: Bland. The smell of the wheat malt is there but it doesn't do anything to wow me.  Taste: I don't know exactly why, but this seems kind of off for the style. Perhaps too much barley and not enough wheat, perhaps the wrong yeast was used.  Mouthfeel: A bit dry, kinda oily.
POSITIVE	A well balanced ale that should indeed bring pride to the brewer. Nice pour of golden to copper. Maintained a slight head when poured into a pint glass. Slight hop smell, not overpowering. Stronger smell of malts. First sip was similar to the smell... noticeable hop character, lots of malt character. Overall well balanced and very drinkable. This is a beer with character from the picture on the bottle and the bottle cap that is made to look like a baseball. Good beer for the beginning to the middle of the evening to start kicking things up, depending on how you do things. Not too dry, considering. Be wary though of the ABV as it is of course higher than a lot of beers. Definitely worth a try.
NEGATIVE	Poured into my quasi-stange (a 14-ounce ex-plum jam jar). My bottle is labeled as containing 5.1% abv, a negligible difference from the 5.4% stated on this website. Clear dark russet with a lumpy cloud of khaki foam. Smells unmistakably like a toasted sandwich with shaved smoked ham and melty smoked gouda (God, I bet that sandwich would pair superbly with this beer). Deeper whiffs reveal a bit of a worty malt scent, but really the only aroma that matters here is the smell of meaty smoke. This smoked pork flavor powerfully introduces the taste and lingers throughout the middle of the sip, at which point the faint hops and bready malt flavor of the Maerzen beer comes through briefly. Then a rather strong mineral taste seeps in, lasts through the finish, and then disappears in a cloudy, smoky aftertaste that lasts about half a minute. Sticky webs of lacing hang about. After a bit, the smoke flavor takes on more of a "been breathing through my mouth at a campfire" character. Medium body, slightly chewy, overall dry mouthfeel. This is really unlike any other beer I've ever tasted. I've had smoked porters before, but they ain't got nothin' on the smokiness of this specimen. It's truly fascinating. It strikes me as something I'd only crave from time to time, and only on certain occasions. Nevertheless, I could see this beer really growing on some folks' palates and becoming a regular choice for everyday drinking. Simply put, a fascinating beer.
NEGATIVE	22 ounce bottle poured into a tulip glass. Sampled on a crisp Fall night.  A: Clear orange/bronze body with a bubbly thin head. Some lace and retention stuck around initially, but by the end of the glass there was absolutely nothing left. No more head or lace. Pretty bland looking beer but initially it was one of the more impressive looking Pumpkin Ales I've seen recently.  S: Allspice, nutmeg, cinnamon and sweet caramelized baked pumpkin flesh. A caramel malt sweetness and dry malts come in towards the end of the aromas. Sweet, spicy and a bit of pumpkin.  T: Fleshy pumpkin puree up front, wonderful spice accents of raw cinnamon, nutmeg, clove and allspice. A slight sweetness accompanies but doesn't overwhelm at first. Faint bitter notes and distant hints of vanilla on the back end. As this warmed, I felt like the flavors became increasingly sweet and artificial. Not enjoyable so much.  M: Lower to mild carbonation, somewhat thin with a crisp and clean finish. A bit of sweet pumpkin sticking around in the linger.  This was a nice beer, and in terms of flavor, perhaps the most likely contender to take on Pumking I've tasted this year. However, I still think this one falls short. The flavors are intense but not as balanced as they could be. Not to mention it got worse at it warmed.
POSITIVE	12oz bottle  Pours a golden yellow/orange color with a medium sized white head. Nothing spectacular in the nose, some good fresh hop notes, lemon/orange skin, with a well balanced pale malt backbone. Balance is key in the flavor of the beer also, although for my tongue i could use some more hop character. An awkward metallic bitterness appears late in the finish and on to the aftertaste. Definitely high drinkability here but not one i would purchase.
POSITIVE	Poured into my pint glass the beer is dark blood red with black edges. Three fingers of tan head blast to the top of my glass. After some settling, thick gons of lace remain all around the rim.  The aroma is black coffee and roast malt up front. Hints of chocolate and bitter hops come through after some warming.  The flavor is mainly bitter black coffee. Some roast malt can be picked out but the bitterness seems to drown everything else out.  Medium to light body. A touch slick and thin.  Overall a subpar porter for my money.
POSITIVE	A: Pours a murky red-orange. Really interesting to look at, no other beer I know of looks quite like this. The small, slighty tan head does not stick around too long after it is poured, but never disappears completely. It does lace somewhat for a high alcohol brew.   S: A total malt overload with alcohol to cut through the sweetness. It smells a lot like raisin bread. There is a bit of spice and bitterness coming through as well. Quite earthy, woody, and complex.  T: Not nearly as sweet as I thought it was going to be. You do get a distinct raisin bread taste just like you smell. And the alcohol is actually really well hidden for a malt forward beer. I think dirty bastard has more sweetness and alcohol than this one (although they are two different styles). The hop bitterness is pleasing and helps to clean off the palate. It really is quite enjoyable, quaffable, and hard to put down as it is a very interesting and pleasing taste.  M: Medium body. Sticky. Decent carbonation.   Overall I really enjoyed this offering from Founders. It is much more complex that I can put into words, and it is not at all alcoholic like the other reviewers have said. Beautifully crafted and the quality is outstanding, as always.
NEGATIVE	Appearance: Dark cola-brown. Fine bubbles form a fine off-white head. Retention isn't great.  Smell: Beef jerky or grilled hot dogs. Peat. Toasted marshmallows. Faint coffee grounds. Reminds me of a campfire.  Taste: Heavy smoky flavor with a sweet foundation. Acidic hop-like bitterness, although I am not certain hops are even used in this style.  Mouthfeel: Fairly light bodied, but creamy enough. Moderately chewable.  Drinkability: I don't like this quite as much as I liked the Aecht Schlenkerla Marzen, which I feel was a little bit more complex. Still, this isn't bad and is great for cooking (thanks to pixel for the awesome barbecue sauce recipe!).
POSITIVE	Look is a very golden yellow pretty Brits and vibrant  Smell is high booze, sweet, fruity, has a certain gang to it.  Taste is buttery, strong yeast funk to it, a fruity sugary up front.  Mouth is pretty good carb bit of a sting to it  Drink is ok but would get old after quite a few of these
POSITIVE	A: Dark tan head that lingers for minutes. Dark brown in color with red highlights when held to a light.  S: Malty with toasted nuts. Toffee. Some floral hints.  T: Dark toasted malts are front and center. Chocolate and toast are present too. It's really good!  M: Smooth and creamy...just great.  D: Yes, very drinkable. It does not feel heavy afterward...even after three pints. Highly recommended.
POSITIVE	A - A nice golden yellow with carbonation racing to the top, good lacing  S - Malts with a hint of hops lingering  T - Very refreshing, nice and light and smooth, has a nice hop flavor for a lager  M - Nothing special to report, sorry  D - I could have this at any time, so light and tastes great!
POSITIVE	This beer almost opaque... a touch of red light passes though. Has a quickly dissipating tan head that leaves some traces of lace behind. Aroma is a mixture of coffee, chocolate, and dates. Flavor is quite rich and complex... almost like an imperial stout, but without some of the vinous qualities and a little lower in alcohol. I found chocolate and coffee mixed with dark fruits and a pleasant maltiness. The mouthfeel is full and creamy, and the carbonation is low to medium. A very nice stout.
POSITIVE	Consumed 9/17/09- from notes.  Brown 12oz bottle poured into a pint glass.  A- Deep black, like black hole black. No light even at the edges. Very tight bubbled half finger mocha head that faded almost instantly. Virtually no lacing.  S- Very rich and roasty. Light coffee smell in there too.  T- Almost a perfect match to the smell, just bolder.  M- Very slick, a little thinner than it looks but still medium bodied.  D- Super sessionable, I was trying not to rush and it was gone in no time. I picked it up as a single but I'll be looking for a six pack next time!
NEGATIVE	Served on draft at canary in Jamaica plain. Served in a pint glass. Cool.  A. Off white head and a murky amber body.  S. Sweet candy and floral hop.  T. Nice piney hope front and a nice sweetbgrain finish. Good rye bread flavor.  M. Medium  D. Very hoppy for style. Kind of drowns out the malt.
POSITIVE	Review 100 for me. hanks to LostCook for this one. VERY generous.  Poured into a snifter. Dark, dark brown. Almost black with a fingers worth of tan head. Head becomes a bubble crown.   Nose is pretty amazing. The sweetness of the maple syrup sticks out right away. Then a big wave of roasted coffee shows itself. As it warms I get more dark chocolate and fruits. Some woodiness rounds it out. Each whiff is slightly different and exciting.  Taste is almost equal to the nose. Sweet maple mingled with coffee, dark chocolate, some vanilla, and a little heat from the alcohol. Amazing stuff.  I like the mouthfeel. Some what thick and the syrup allws the flavor to coat the tongue.  Overall this beer lives up to everything I had heard. Count myself very lucky to score a bottle here in Colorado.
POSITIVE	A - Poured yellow with a massive head.  S - Smells like an IPA due to the dry hops T - Malty sweetness turns to a bitter hop ending. I found that the bitterness tuned down after the first couple of drinks. MF - a bit thin and carbonated D - This was a great dry-hopped pale ale. This was a bit bitter for me at first, but as it warmed it became quite tasty.
POSITIVE	Nice corked and caged bottle poured into my Delirium Tremens.  Very nice pour, a very nice offwhite head that is fluffy and very aromatic. A ruby brown color, not too dark, with a really nice redish hue in the light and a copper/tan head.  Smell - the hops smell young, as though the finishing hops was really added at the very end of the boil, or an insane was put it. Smells a bit like Kent, but not sure.  Taste - This is a really great aged barleywine, and definitely has the ability to be aged for a while. Nice malts mixed in the the flavor from the barrel, actually really well balanced. Many time a lot of breweries want to make a beer that is barrel aged - this is one where the marriage of barrel aged and a nice barlwywine go together without err.  Overall - this is an excellent brew. I hesitate to give it more than it is worth right now as I believe that this will benefit tremendously from some time in the cellar. As mentioned before, the hops smell very young, and with proper aging and patience, this has potential to get very new characteristics.  Find these, but try them in a few months. You will not be disappointed with this now - but you should love it in time.  Cheers.
NEGATIVE	Having not had this beer in well over 1.5 years, I decided to give this another try. Served on-tap at, poured into a 12 ounce goblet.  A: Ruby copper colored body, fairly clear but definitely has a bit of haze. Small off-white head that didn't last too long, nor did it leave any real lace on the glass. To style, it looks alright; nothing spectacular but touches above average.  S: Deep dark, rich caramel malts, brown sugar, molasses and a definite boozy element. Not overwhelmed by any one quality but towards the end the oak is more noticeable. Fresh, matured oak wood creates an additional layer of depth but doesn't take the aromas deep enough, in my opinion.  T: Initially there's nothing on the front of the palate, instead it's consumed by the boozy bite from the swallow. Another sip, along with some palate adjustment, brings forward the dark and rich flavors. Molasses, burnt sugar and dark fruits (fig, raisin) are halfway in. The back end and finish leaves with a strange astringency from the oak. Overly woody and a bit out of place it seems. The alcohol doesn't fuse with the wood notes like other great wood/barrel-aged beers do.  M: Fairly well carbonated and a bit thinner on the palate than I would have recalled or liked. Not watery but not the feel I was hoping for in an Old Ale.  For me, this style is certainly hit or miss and while I don't think this was a complete miss, it wasn't a dead-on hit either. There are some really nice complexities in the beer but also some very tangent flavors. There doesn't seem to be a mastered balance in the flavor profile, but it still does have qualities that make it enjoyable.
NEGATIVE	Pours a murky ruby to blood in color with a bubble gum pink head that builds to a finger and then recedes to nothing quickly. Aroma is a mix of sweet raspberry puree along with a lemony tartness. Taste is much the same, like a not quite ripe, tart raspberry, there is some raspberry sweetness underneath that slides across the back of the tongue, but the tartness is dominant. Carbonation at first is a bit sparkling with a crisp effervescence, this dies down as it warms but there is still a bite at the back of the throat. Reminds me very much of another tart raspberry beer except for the alcohol content. The alcohol on the chalkboard at the pub stated 10.3 and it is almost non-evident, very well hidden/balanced. This is definitely not one I can do many of both because of its strength and its strong fruit flavors, but it captures the essence of raspberries very well and was a nice festive one to have after belgian waffles this holiday morning.
POSITIVE	A: The beer poured with a large off white head and a dark ruby color. A decent amount of lacing was left behind from this truly beautiful beer.  S: Very fruity, lots of hops, lots of sweetness. The smell was a bit strange at first because I expected plain old hops. Regardless, the smell was great.  T: Very fruity and sweet up front, great bitterness in the middle, and some dry bitterness at the end. This beer was nice and sweet with a lot of fruit flavor. Exceptional.  M: Well carbonated, dry, crisp.  D: This beer didn't taste anything like 7.9% which means I can drink more of it.
POSITIVE	Home Run!  Founders hit it out of the park with this one. Pours a raspberry red in color with some nice carbonation bubbles filling the top of the glass. Smell is tart raspberries. Taste is much the same. Amazing enough, I didn't tire of it by the end of the bomber. This is a very easy drinker, you get no hints of the 12.3% ABV. This was a real treat.
POSITIVE	Happy to see that Hoppin Frog has found it's way to DC. This is a big delicious stout, as you'd expect. Pour is dark brown, near black, with a half-finger of tan head that dissolves down to a thin film. Just a hint of lacing. Nose is big - chocolate, roastiness, some smoke, alcohol (although not too strong). Flavor is likewise - big flavors are chocolate, smoky roasted malt, and sweet brown sugar. This is a roasty RIS, that's for sure, not just a straight up sweet stout. Only fault I have is that alcohol; this one might benefit from being put down for a year or two. Overall though, very nice RIS, if a touch on the pricey side.   $7.90/De Vines/22 oz
POSITIVE	Served chilled in a tulip glass, from a twenty-two ounce brown bottle. Poured a beautiful cranberry red color. Almost an inch of soapy, bubbly, pinkish red colored head formed. Pretty quickly faded into a small ring in the glass. It did leave small spots of thin lace on the glass. A big nose full of raspberries, and plenty of dry alcohol. Almost Chambord like. Taste was pretty much the same. Tons of thick fresh raspberry flavors, sugary sweet with almost mouth puckering sourness. Finishes rather smooth with quite a bit of throat and body warming alcohol, and pretty dry. Has a nice, full bodied, smooth mouthfeel. Plenty of tingly carbonation felt on the tongue. Pretty good drinkability, but I choose to enjoy it sip by sip. Pretty damn good in my opinion. Didn't know what to expect coming into this, but was pleasantly surprised.
POSITIVE	Pours a very nice deep orange with a big blossoming head that leaves some real nice lacing,aroma lightly smoky from the yeast with some tropical-like fruitiness.Taste is very juicy and fresh tasting with that light smoke flavor in the background with some real nice fruitiness.I real winner in my book from Stoudts I would drink again for sure.
NEGATIVE	Bottle sample thanks to Milos.A deep amber body crowned with a slightly off white cap. Bready nose has caramel, cereal, figs. Quite sweet with a medium bitterness that makes this fairly drinkable. Medium bodied, creamy,lengthy sweet finish. Thanks again Milos!
NEGATIVE	Pours a dark reddish brown, with a 1/8 inch head that fades rapidly to a very thin, spotty cap, leaving behind minimal lacing. I really like the color, but the lack of head retention is a bit disapointing, even for a this high abv beer.  Smell; very belgianesque, with candied sugar and somewhat yeasty. The dark fruits are pleasant, with cherries and plums, but there's also some bubblegum and a little banana.  Taste; the bubblegum and bananas come out a bit more strongly in the flavor. The candied sugar has a significant presence, and the cherries and plums make a nice appearance as well. Not quite as good as the nose, but still nice. Mouthfeel is on the thin side, especially with the lack of carbonation to help out. Drinkability is not bad for such a big beer.  Overall this is a beer I definitely preferred on tap as opposed o the bottle, but I still found it pretty enjoyable. Can't wait to see what Founders decides to bottle next.
NEGATIVE	For a light beer it's not all that bad. I'll drink one if it's handed to me but I'm not going to necessarily ever look for it (not that it's hard to find). Darker shade of gold so it's not as pale looking as many other light lagers. Sweet, grainy/hay taste, watery but also nothing bad either. Really, actually, one of the better light beers I've had.
POSITIVE	A: dark black nice tan lingering head. S: deep dark coffee flavors and a nice light maltiness with some chocolate. T: Big coffee notes with hints of molasses and chocolate. Very sweet with little licorice notes. M: nice medium bodied, very drinkable stout. Taste lingers but not super wet. Very good, very solid, comparable to w'n'b, but more coffee and fresher in this instance.
POSITIVE	What's amazing is this isn't a lambic, tart cherries carry the flavor. Appearance is like ruby red grapefruit juice with a light pink tinted head, fine bubbly carbonation forms evenly with lacing down the sides of my glass. Aromatics offer up tart cherries more so the peels bringing alcohol and sweetness together along with the smell of evident grain infused within potent tart cherries. Flavor is excellent it lands some where between a sour ale and some cherry flavor jam. Reluctantly sweet and sour is thrown my way, but in the mix I find cherry peels carrying some booziness and some light cereal grains blending so well with the juices of mother nature. What an excellent blend touch of vinegar like acidity in the lightest vinegarette imaginable. Sweet syrupy layers of cherry sweetness quickly fade to dry tartness excellent creation very interesting like cherry cider. Great stuff I remember Rubaeus, right up there with that fruit ale. Founders doesn't offend I detect real fruit with a balanced profile mouthfeel is light at times with a reduced simple syrup border at times. Carbonation is perfect that's where everything carries out so well, quite the experience here. Girls will dig it and beergeeks will try and figure out how they did it. Drinkability is nice I don't get tired of the tartness or the cherry sweetness a great yin and yang offered up in a glass this one is good for your chee.
NEGATIVE	I drank this porter in the backyard over a campfire so I must admit, it went straight from the bottle to my lips. Overall it was a decent porter. It's flavor was just right - not overbearing and not tasteless. My biggest downer on this beer was the mouthfeel - I would love for it to have been creamery. That said, this is a porter where you could enjoy a sixer if the occasion called for it.
NEGATIVE	a- deep copper body with a thin head  s- blast of malt, toffee, caramel, burnt sugar, prune, some banana too  t- a bit boozy, very similar to the smell, nice sharp attack with ample malt, finishes very full with a dash of hoppy bitterness  m- thicker than expected  o- first time having a scotch ale, pretty satisfied and feel it is a great example, personally too malt forward, though I'm sure that is indicative of the style
NEGATIVE	WOW this is kinda bad...in a word...yeah so um ok...appearance was semi nothing...it poured a very light clear color and the can it came in looked like the cover for some lame japanese cartoon...the smell was not apparent at all i tried so hard that i managed to inhale some of it through my nose...i wouldnt recomend that...it stings...so yea moving on the taste was not very apparent either, carbination and a water-esque taste with a hint of bitterness. The mouthfeel wasnt much better than the rest of it. The mouthfell was very watery and carbonated. Drinkability was a 2 and thats only if you wanna get smashed on a low budget.
POSITIVE	Pours a dark ruby hued brown with a thin tan head. Nose is malty with an almost cardboard tree kind of thing going on. The first thing I thought when I took a sip was: boozy! Thankfully that seems to fade away as time goes on. What I get after that is a thick malty backbone with a sweet earthy edge. Peaty edge on the backside. Full flavor profile, not a mass of complexity. Feel is smooth on liquid and carbonation is lower. After the booze calms down here this gets better.  Thanks to tburkhart for this one.
NEGATIVE	It's pronounced like "Keeper". One more sample from the Beer Traveler's pack brings us to this brew from Poland. On to the beer:  Clear straw color as it's poured, it's a light blonde with a good head when it settles into my glass. Not surpisingly from its green body, there's a bit of skunk, but it clears out for a straw and grainy aroma. Tastes like a pilsner with its herbal and hop flavors, but a bit dumbed down. It leaves a lemon aftertaste after each drink. It isn't bad overall, but I expected a little more on a bottle that read "Pils.".
POSITIVE	A- Pours a midnight black with one and a half fingers of nougat colored head.  S-This smells familiar... smells a lot like many Black IPA's I've had: notes of chocolate with pine, some orange and a hint of roasted malt.  T-Rich, dark, sweet and slightly bitter chocolate at the forefront with some bitter pine, and some dry orange and a spicy pepper/alcohol note on the finish.  M-This could be one of the thicker beers I've had, it has the viscosity of syrup, with low carbonation and a drying, warming sensation in the back of the palate/throat.  D-The alcohol is simply not present besides it's warming presence in the feel. Way too easy drinking for a 12% beer, I've had 8% stouts that drink hotter than this. The taste is solid, but I wish there was a little bit more complexity there.
NEGATIVE	poured into a stemless wine glass,this beer is almost pink,looks similar to a rose.overall looks nice.  smell is of tart cherries,cinnamon,a little bit of pie crust.palate is tart cherries and biscuity malt.reminds me of drinking cherry pie.  mouthfeel and carbonation are moderate.overall this is a really good fruit beer.
NEGATIVE	On tap at the Pike Pub and Brewery in Seattle. Served by a most excellent bartender with a bald head in a pint glass for around $5.  The beer looks decent in the glass. The biggest issue I had with the appearance is the haze - I'd like a bit more clarity in my double IPA, especially if it's coming from the West Coast. But the copper-orange colored beer looks nice and has a white head that quickly recedes to a film. Not enough lace either. That being said, this is appetizing enough.  The smell is full of citrus notes from the hops, balanced by a full malt note. There's some grapefruit and orange, plus some sugar and a touch of booze. Overall the expression is great, but the malt could be toned down a bit as I found it distracted from the hop aromas, which should be the stars of the show.  The taste has much of the same going on. There's some huge notes of grapefruit, orange, and pineapple. The bitterness peaks just as the malty base becomes known. It has good balance between malt and hops, but the malt is a bit "wet" and slightly old tasting. I appreciate the fact this isn't another Pliny clone, but I could stand a bit more emphasis on the hops. A bit of booze emerges at the end, but is relatively well hidden.  The mouthfeel of Pike's Double IPA is probably the best part of the beer. It's medium bodied with a nice carbonation that lets it be creamy without becoming sticky or syrupy. This beer was enjoyable and would satisfy a drinker's hop fix. But, for me, the West Coast style just works better without so much caramel.
NEGATIVE	Wow, this thing is a monster! Pours reddish-orange but my particular bottle had very little head or retention. It did travel cross-country but then again several other beers did and they still poured perfectly. Smell is of hops, alcohol (but only a little) and a strong sweet caramel. Smells like a Barleywine. Taste is good. Taste is of hops and nothing but hops. At times there is a bit of a malt backbone that tries to make an appearance with a bit of caramel but the hops beat it down. A thick, oily, and warming sensation as it does down. Overall this is a very well crafted beer. I have to say I've had several beers that have a much lower ABV where I notice the alcohol more. I've heard people debate on what catagory this beer should be in. As for a DIPA or Barleywine I really dont know. All I know is that this beer has a hell of a kick to it and you should drink this warmer and a bottle should last you about 2 hours or so. Sip and enjoy!
POSITIVE	Sampled on 2-25-07  Pours a nice bright orange with a quickly dissipating head and lacing that follows the level of the beer down.  Smell is of floral hops, small amounts of citrus and pine.  Taste is good, a lot of hop complexity without being too bitter, but with an earthy aftertaste that keeps this beer from being better.  Mouthfeel is very good, a little syrupy, what you want in an IPA.  Drinkability is good, earthy aftertaste wears on after awhile.  Overall, not the best American IPA I've had (aftertaste), but I'll chalk that up to personal taste and rate it on the other characteristics.
POSITIVE	A: dark brown with bright white head. minimal head fades quickly, leaving some lace, but not enough, bah..  S: bbq. seriously, the touch of sweet, slightly smoky maltiness reminds me of a mix between bbq chicken and a nicely done pot roast. my first rauchbier so tough to judge much, but approximately what i was expecting, and pretty good.  T: again little experience to go on, but wish i had more.. well balanced, nice maltiness up front, touch of caramel and breadiness balancing the middle-finish touch of smoky bbq, finishing dry and fairly crisp really, with some touch of hoppy bitter just on the after-taste. leaves the bit of sweet bbq in the mouth just a bit, while staying crisp.  M: pretty chewy, thick and smooth. good amount of carbonation just to make it crisp enough  D: again, i know i'll have to come back to this once i've tried more rauchs, but definitely tasty and sessionable. going great with my extra sharp cheddar mac and cheese.
POSITIVE	Appearance - Black liquid with a dense tan head. Lacking a bit in color.  Smell - Chocolate, cream, toast and a hint of coffee. Sweet and mellow, very inviting.  Taste & mouthfeel - Mild milky sweetness with just a touch of roasty bitterness. Hints of chocolate and toffee with a bittersweet finish. Not bland, but very mellow and balanced - one of the gentler imperial stouts I've had. Soft carbonation. Creamy but not exceptionally thick. Very good stuff.
POSITIVE	a) Mostly clear, burnished copper/chestnut. 1cm off-white head, good bubbling  s) Ham hocks, touch of chocolate, and grain husks.  f) Wow...outstanding. Every smoked thing I've consumed... from ham to lapsang souchong.... makes an appearance here. Slight chocolatey sweetness as well, hint of ash.  m) Quite light, crisply finishing, with room for smokey characters to play.  d) Lovely drink.... I haven't consumed more than one at a time, so not sure of the long-term effects of smokiness.
POSITIVE	12 ounce bottle in a snifter  A: Pours alot darker then I expected, amber almost brown, great head.  S: malts take over the aroma, but there are hops in the background.  T: wow, this is great I have not had anything quite like this. cocoa, hops and alcohol, it is more hop forward than expected from its appearance and smell  M: quite a hop bite, thick full body  D: it drinks well, good thing I got 2 bottles I am going to hold on to the other one till next year and revisit this one i feel it will age well.
POSITIVE	Poured a very nice bright orange, sparkling in the sun light in BRBP's outside seating; no head and very little lacing, though. Nice deep malty scent, with great sweet malts and a nice caramel aroma in the nose. Excellent flavor, with great caramel tones to a nice thick and sweet maltiness; slight hints of apple in it. Went down very smooth, extremely crisp and clean.
NEGATIVE	Serving Type - Bottle  Appearance - Very golden yellow, pale. Very little head. Some carbination also.  Smell -Strong fresh hop smell. Nice pineapple,orange kick with floral odor also.   Taste - Well everything was going so well up til this point. Very dry, bitter taste. The hop taste is bitter, almost no citrus flavor to them. Almost has a pilsner taste to it. Im not getting any kind of spice flavors either. This beer aint for me  Mouthfeel - I hate the aftertaste. My tounge has this bitter bland taste like ive been eating wax. Doesnt do a thing for me.   Drinkabilty - Not for me. Got a 4-pack, drank one, got 3 left that will be offered to visitors.
NEGATIVE	Poured into a standard pint glass.  A - Cherry mahogany colored brew with a small layer of froth on top. Lacing was quite nice.  S - Brown sugar and toffee dominate the nose, with some caramel malts showing through.  T - Big malty flavor, rich and sugary. Little to no bitterness, but a noticeable alcohol burn is present. Aftertaste reminiscent of cherries.  M - Full bodied ale with a low carbonation level. Very dry.  D - A little too boozy for me, but there are some redeeming qualities. Worth a try.
NEGATIVE	I tried this ruby tinged dark copper IPA with a fast fading head at The Bier Garden in Asheville, NC. A malt and floral hop aroma wafts up, and then vanishes quickly to a light hop smell - Not very IPA-like. The malt is lightly sweet with a light herbal quality. The hops possess a grapefruit and mild lemony bitterness. The malt is a little grainy and slightly mealy (though not overly so). A hint of mint can is detected within the aforementioned herbal quality. The sweetness unfolds as the glass empties. This isn't a bad ale; it's just not IPA enough.
NEGATIVE	the remains of a beers of the world pack received for christmas  a: Decent white head, reasonable retention. Pale golden in color.  s: A metallic aroma covers much of the aroma. Some watery grain under that.  m: medium carbonation and light body  t: clean malt flavors, light sulfuric hops, and a gentle hop bite.  d: easy enough  it IS a light lager, and it's decent, so no real problems with giving it some relatively high scores
POSITIVE	A-pours a dark red with a decent head.  S-Very hoppy..not unpleasant at all. You can smell the nutty character in the bouquet.  T-Very hoppy initially with the nuttiness and rye flavors coming through at the end.  M-I was surprised at how thin this beer felt given it's hoppiness and higher abv.  D-It's very drinkable...I made the mistake of bottle drinking a couple of these and for some reason that amplified the rye/nutty characteristics and made it un pleasant. Out of the glass it was stellar.
POSITIVE	appearance: The pour from the import style bottle gives a 0.5" bone white head that soon becomes a thin ring and a layer on the surface. The beer is a ultra-clear pale golden in color.  smell: Very "pilsner" in aroma, with clean German pale malts, a touch of grassy noble hops, and a slight sulfuric aroma. Easily noticeable, yet light enough to be called subtle, is a hint of that distinctive Aecht smoke aroma. If this wasn't such a light beer, the smoke would be easily overlooked.  mouthfeel: The carbonation is on the border between medium and high, and the body is light.  taste: Clean, pale German malts are pretty much even in strength with a subtle, natural hardwood smoke flavor. I get just a touch of noble hop flavor, mainly after the stronger flavors have subsided. Following the initial flavor rush after the swallow, the flavor becomes just slightly metallic. A light bitterness then kicks in, lingering with just a touch of metal and smoke in the finish.  drinkability: Very easily drinkable  Picked up a single bottle from Sam's Blue Light in Durham. I was told there that although this beer contains no smoked malt, it is made in/on the same equipment with which Aecht makes their rauchbiers, and in turn, picks up some of that characteristic.
POSITIVE	Review No. 150  Served into a 10oz snifter.  I was lucky enough to drink this right next to Dave Engbers.   Pours a muddy brown. Along the lines of a cola. Head was nill. Smell was f'n amazing. Loaded with bourbon. Sweetness from maple syrup. This beer in my mouth was so silky smooth. The taste started sweet then quickly went to a salty cashew. Unbelievably good. For a 10% beer it went down the hatch with ease. In fact I had three pours in a 45 minute span.  Easily in the top ten of the best beers I've ever had. Search it, seek it, destroy it. Your life will forever be changed.
POSITIVE	A: peach yellow/orange body, finger white head,  glorious lacing  S: BIG grapefruit/peach nose, nice fresh pine  T: sweet peach/grapefruit, pine/earthy, long bitter oily finish  M: med body, big sticky/oily mouth  O: OH MY WORD! Founders has done it again. It is shocking that this is an IPA, this is the  quality level of some other breweries  DOUBLE IPAs. I would recommend this to ALL HOP HEADS.   DELICIOUS, SEEK IT OUT!
NEGATIVE	Appearance is DARK and clear. Smell is hoppy and very nice. The mouthfeel is creamy, thick and heavy. The taste is better up front and in the back of the mouth. Bitter start with a slight sweet finish. Overall this is a strong beer in flavor and in ABV. This beer will go well with anything HOT..
POSITIVE	Poured from the bottle into a pint glass. Pure walnut opaqueness dark as brown can get on the body without being black. This really nice borderline thick syrup pour also. Head is really tiny maybe a finger at most, but a great coffee espresso color looking head with tight bubbles. Leaves about 2mm collar throughout the glass for a good while. Minimal lacing.  Toasty oats and malt, with faint milk chocolate on the nose. Very nice smelling. This has to be the only Oatmeal Imperial stout beer I've whiffed that actually smells like it has oats in it. Love the bouquet feels like that malt shake is coming.  As for taste, big chocolate boom, and mild carbonation. Expansive feel in the back palate of an thick anisette aftertaste with a not to big alcohol heat but noticeable.  Pretty good mix of flavors and feel. I'd have again, another winner for drinkability from Hoppin' Frog.
NEGATIVE	Appearance: Dark reddish brown amber color.  Smell: Not as much nose as I expected, but it was nutty and a little fruity.  Taste: Surprising amount of taste after not detecting much in the nose, but it is a little watery and maybe that could be contributing to the weak nose. Caramel malts, earthy mild hops, grains and nuts. Flavors are balanced, but mild and not as much hop flavor as I expected.  Mouthfeel: Quite smooth.  Drinkability: Decent.
NEGATIVE	Bottle poured into a nonic pint.  A- The 1-finger tan head drops a little too quickly to a full lace, but a little shake or swirl will bring it back. The body is a little hazy and thoroughly brown. Good rings were left on the glass.  S- Quite sweet initially, maybe even berry-like. There was a combination of chocolate and brown sugar with hints of molasses or even maple syrup. The chocolate and brown sugar really stood out as the beer warmed.  T- A little roasty grain. Caramel sweetness. Chocolate notes. Hopped just enough to take the sweet edge of things. I don't know if sour is the right term, but a bit of "twang" permiates the flavor. It's a little long in the finish.  M- Fairly significant carbonation provides a real bite. Pretty light bodied otherwise.  D- Something I'm glad I tried, but not something I'd seek out. As far as an American Brown Ale, it's a little lacking. That said, it's nice to see a Mexican beer that isn't a blonde lager. If this was on the beer list next to the usual suspects of Mexican beer, it would definitely get the nod.
NEGATIVE	Nice beer, glad I met it. Medium/dark golden hue with a full finger head that quickly left leaving a minor ring and a touch of cling. Aroma had a slight maltiness to it. Medium body and carbonation. Taste had a slight malty hint to start but quickly switched to the cascade hops and a citrus end. Very slight syrupy mouthfeel.
POSITIVE	I have no idea why I picked up coffee in this one when it doesn't seem like anyone else has  A - hazy straw body with no head and tiny bit of white lacing  S - sweet coffee and caramel with some hazelnut notes  T - sweet coffee and floral hop notes  M - Medium body with medium carbonation  D - Pretty good. Coffee was unexpected but welcomed addition
POSITIVE	Wow, this is one messed up label. My 11-year-old son doesn't want to even look at it.  The pour gave me a one finger, rocky head atop a hazy yellow body. Didn't expect the haze - but not put off by it either.  Aroma was of massive grapefruit, with hints of orange zest. Pretty nice combination. Makes me wonder what my taste buds are getting into.  Taste was a huge blast of intense bitter pine and citrus, with hop resins thrown in. IBU's are VERY apparent in this one. Good thing I'm a hophead. Throughout the consumption of this beer, the bitterness grew on me, until by the final swallow I was sorry to see it gone. The citrus had begun to bloom. The malt was a nice support, but the hops were definitely to the fore.  Mouthfeel is a little oily, but a nice body.   Drinkability is deceptive for a brew with this high an ABV. It went down fast and easy, and I could easily have gone for another two or three. Makes me wish I'd bought more. Oh, the woes of one who wants to try as many different beers as possible. Oh well. I know that if I need to bring something to a housewarming or a party this summer, this is going to be it.
POSITIVE	On-tap at Beachwood BBQ, the last one of the day. On to the beer:  Here's a nice breakaway from Belgian saisons. The clean bodied yellow color with sparking carbonation makes one think it's a pilsner, but it's not. The aroma is full of juniper and a little edge of lime. Other spices also work into the nose, and it balances out well. To taste, there is a little citrus, juniper, and lime. The spices are overbreaing as they can be in Belgian saisons, so it, along with its light, smooth carbonated body, make it easy to get down.
POSITIVE	.5L beauty pours an efferevescent amber/caramel with 4 fingers of fluffy tan colored head. A little lacing & head retention  S: Bigtime smokeyness & a little fruittyness as this warms  T: Slight smokeyness, ham or bacon-like up front & some bubblegum. Some fruittyness sneaks in as it warms along with a hint of caramel. Finishes dry, tart, slightly smokey & with a hint of nuttyness & juicyfruit  MF: Medium bodied & hint of oilyness with low carbonation& juicyness  Drinks pretty easy, a nice take on the style that I don't remember having the one weekend I spent in Bamberg. Not as nice as the urbock, but more sessionable & the smokeyness seems more subdued. Tasty!
NEGATIVE	I like this in small doses.  A- Pink in color with a small pink tint head.  S- Strong Raspberry, Spicey hint. Impressive exites you to take that first drink.  T- Again very friuty specifically rapsberry, though you forget that you are still drinking beer.   M- Nice level of carbination, good body.  D- Great brew in small doses. I found it hard to finish a second one.
POSITIVE	My first beer from Cucapa`,their wares are at Bestway here in G-boro.Poured into an imperial nonic a clear rich amber/copper with a very thin almost non existent head.Alot of caramel malt in the nose along with spicy rye and a smattering of citric hops,nice aromas but they could have a bit more punch.Well rounded on the palate with all aspects of the beer showing thru,a big caramel/biscuit base mixed with resiny hops,a decent shot of spicy rye comes in a nice finish.A mellow drinker thats well rounded on the palate,a nice first beer from this Mexican brewery for me.
NEGATIVE	I finally hit the last bottle from the Under 100 BIF monster package sent to me by mikereaser. And talk about under 100 reviews: this one had zero reviews when I received it, and only has one review at the time I drank it. Pretty cool. It was a killer box of beers too, big fat thanks again to mike!  This one pours fairly dark. Opaque dark iced tea color. Very respectable off-white head of medium sized bubbles, but not much retention.  Smells of spices, mainly cloves, not too overpowering.  Taste is rather ordinary if anything. Don't even really taste the spices that I smell.  Smooth and drinkable but to put it bluntly: bland.  Overall: not much to write about
POSITIVE	first off, what an interesting beer. been on my mind for days. so different, so odd, so good? pours a murky, chocolate color with a one finger tan head. BOOM! that smell hits ya. right away, im reminded of my summer quests involving over smoked venison meat. haha. beef jerky, strong hickory? (it says beechwood on the bottle but it smells just like hickory to me), leather, sausage, pepper, tons of spices and clove. oddly appealing to me. like picking up a dirty shirt and smelling it twice. thankfully the taste is not as strong as the aroma. smoke on the water. light, malty, and slightly sweet. BBQ beer for sure. unique and cool. i wouldn't call this one a sipper, more like a sniffer. ha. get this one if you see it.
POSITIVE	Having this beer on tap adds so much to it.   This is trualy a well done porter has every part of it is well done. I keep going back to this all the time. Usually have a sixer in my fridge at all times its that good. Like I said having it on tap though does not compare to having it bottled, if you get the chance have a pint!
POSITIVE	Poured from chilled bottle into pint glass.  A: Deep mahogany - completely opaque with a 1/4 inch creamy chocolate head that dissipated quickly, leaving a tiny collar. Light lacing.  S: Lots of chocolate (blend of dark/semi-sweet), blended with rich dark roasted coffee, hints of vanilla and smoky charred wood, with a light touch of dark fruit sweetness (cherry, prune).  T: Very full, rich - much like the nose; dark chocolates and dark roasted coffee galore up front followed by a mild chocolately sweetness. Finishes with a mild bitterness reminiscent of grapefruit and dark chocolate. Quite tasty, though not terribly complex. Bitterness lessens and sweetened chocolate flavors shine through more as beer warms.  M: Rich and full but a little thin. Good carbonation.  D: Goes down so smoothly - could easily put 2 or 3 of these away. Delicious pairing with blueberry pie - fantastic dessert or sipper beer.
POSITIVE	appearance) an orange/peach color with little head and laciing  smell) a nice pine and hop smell initial hits you but dicipates into more of a medium malt/hop aroma  taste) the taste is that of a solid but not excellent ipa good hop/malt balance  mouthfeel) relatively smooth for abv above 6% wish there was some hop bitterness at the back end, would exponentially improve this beer   drinkability) not overly sweat and not overly bitter and with a reasonable abv this beer goes down smooth and is a good introduction into the craft ipa world
POSITIVE	From a 500 ml bottle. Dark cola brown, near black with a dense head of chocolate like black foam. Aromas are all dark roasted patent malts, a bit of chocolate, coffee, and caramel, and some nice hops in the mix as well. Taste is roasty, with chocolate and coffee notes as well as some greenish hops and some nice caramel sweetness. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and quite nice. Drinkability is damn good. I'm glad this is back, makes me proud to be Polish, and at $2 a 500ml bottle this is a bargain as well!
NEGATIVE	A: Head magically conjured out of nowhere. At the beginning of the pour it didn't look like this beer had carbonation. A small remnant of a dark hay colored head remains. Unfiltered body, rootbeer mixed with pomegranite juice tone.   S: Multidimensional nose of roasted malts, raisin, alcohol and a bit of peet.  T: Oh very nice...very nice indeed. Lets begin from the top. Flavors of bittersweet chocolate, roasted grains dominate the forefront. Strawberry sweetness flows downstream to a solid friendly bitterness. Finishes to a very ash like taste but in a good way. And as it warm, the alcohol esters increase.  M: Body is a bit thin for the style, I could use it to be a bit chewier.   D: Not bad, I would have actually liked it to have been smokier. But I really enjoyed to strawberry alcohol esters it created.
NEGATIVE	Appearance- the body is a beautiful amber, almost red. While the head is frothy and off white. Fairly hazy.  Smell- very heavy hops, leaning more towards citrus and floral. Some rye spiciness. Very IPA-like.  Taste- more like the perfectly balanced ipa than a rye pale. But absolutely exceptional. Citrus and floral notes hit a spicy biscuit malt wall. Fantastic  Mouthfeel- medium body with a prickly carbonation.  Drinkability- the full taste of this beer makes it a sipper. I wouldn't drink more than one. But its not difficult to drink by any means...
POSITIVE	In general, a good doppelbock. Available in Canada: fantastic!  Pours a very dark black/brown, but shows red/mahogany when held up to the light. Big bubbly Guinness-like head, with a little lacing but not too much. Opaque, but some 'floaties'.  Aroma is reasonably complex, although not "blow your mind" or anything. Dark fruits, raisins, and currents, plus bread (the usual doppelbock palette). In addition, some spritzy lemon in there you don't usually get, and maybe a little bit of sweet cake.  Initial sips are mildly metallic. I'm not sure if this indicates that the bottle wasn't fresh... bought it at the LCBO recently, but there's no date on it. Metallic flavours fade as it warms, to be replaced by roasted or burnt chocolate, raisins, prunes, and hints of something artificial, or maybe corn syrup.  Mouthfeel is pretty good, if a little on the thing side. Aftertaste is bready and mildly hoppy.  Wonder if the LCBO still has any of this left...
POSITIVE	Hazy dirty golden in color; surprising, as most in this style have a more orange-leaning tint. The head is thin, even non-existent in a matter of seconds. With just a little swirl a thin sheet of foam revives and there is some lace left on the glass.  Aroma is hop-centric, although on the flowery, delicate side of the citrus spectrum. No nostril-hair burn or grapefruit rind intensity. What appears is nice, clean and enjoyable, just barely on the "imperial" side of an old-school IPA really. Never would've guessed this was a double IPA based on appearance and smell.  At first I thought the taste was as so-so as the appearance and as polite as the smell, but no, the middle to end of the sip finds a flame of fruity hops growing and then flaring, which proceeds right into the finish where a raw grassiness lingers for some time. Maltiness ekes into butterscotch territory, and a firm alcoholic warmth underscores everything above it. Damn near perfect, although not the kind of hop bomb would might have expected.   Mouthfeel is creamy and lightly sticky, not too thick or syrupy but with enough commanding weight to cruise along parallel and in cahoots with the complexity of the flavor.  Definitely not typical, and definitely not as insane as expected, this is one of the most drinkable IPAs I've ever had, and one of the most balanced as well. Be sure to give it a chance and contemplate it carefully before passing judgment. Thanks to super-cool BA kels for the assist!
NEGATIVE	A - Orange yellow beer with a white head that that faded to a thick ring and good cap. Big splotches that stick to the sides.   S - Drank this next to Mathias III, and this one has a lot more focus on dank grass and pine. Almost smells wet-hopped, with some bitter resin on the end  T - Taste is full of pine, wet grass, resin, slight tropical fruit, pine. A lot different than its progeny, Mathias III. Malt backbone adds some sweet notes.   O - Very solid. If you like beers that focus on dank and wet, this is a good DIPA for you.
NEGATIVE	Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a snifter.  A - Dark reddish brown, slightly cloudy. Head is " thick on pour, then fades to ring around the glass. Very little lacing.  S - Inviting mix of malt, smoke and alcohol. Some sweet brown sugar notes.  T - Strong roasted bitterness mixed with smoke. Acrid bitterness in the middle. Dry finish with more bitterness and smoke.   M - Medium to heavy body. Carbonation is restrained and does not lighten the feel. No alcohol burn.  D - Overall much too bitter and full of roast and coffee notes that are not part of the traditional style. I appreciate the smoke, but the rest is too much of a culture clash from what I'm expecting.
POSITIVE	Pours a dark rusty brown with a nice head that doesn't want to stay around, some lacing.  Smells of sweet malts, caramel, dark fruit, some maple maybe?  Tastes like it smells very sweet, molasses, raisins and dark fruit, a variety of spices. Not bad at all.  Thick mouthfeel and very drinkable, the alcohol is barely noticeable. My first Founder's brew, I was expecting a bit more, but I'm not a fan of the style in the first place.
POSITIVE	a- i've had problems with this one gushing from time to time, but normally it pours burnt sienna with a 1" tan head.  s- big on the coffee and oatmeal, a little boozy with a hint of chocolate and caramel.  t- this is one of the smoother-tasting, harmonious stouts i've had. burnt sugar, chocolate, coffee make this one like the kindest mocha you've ever had on a day not unlike this one (-16 deg. F in chicago right now). the bitterness is all coffee-based in this one, little to no hops. a marvelous symphony.  m- almost as smooth as silk, little carbonation once it settles down, but overall tremendous.  d- light on the alcohol compared to most big stouts, you can have one of these and feel relaxed, but not snoggered. perfect for a winter night, like i said earlier.
NEGATIVE	This one pours a dark dark brown color with a small head that left a little lacing on the glass. The aroma was very strong - chocolates, coffee, and some other stuff that I didn't care much for - still decent and very complex. Not being a fan of the average porter taste, I didn't get too much enjoyment out of this one. I'll give it plenty of credit for being very complex and interesting, but the taste was just not to my liking. It tastes like an imperial stout mixed with a porter mixed with rum(?). The alcohol is present in the taste and has a lot of roastedness in the taste.
POSITIVE	Maybe we got a revamped version of this beer as both sierrags and I are hopheads and it takes a good hoppy beer to please us....this was a GOOD hoppy beer.  A-Copper with a light tan head leaving nice lacing behind.  S-Sweet malts meld with the strong presence of citrus and floral hops.  T-Hoppy? Hell yeah! This is a citrus hop lovers beer for sure. Nice use of "west-coast" style hops for sure. Good malty backbone upholds the generous hop bill.  M-Medium body with a pleasant dry finish.  D-Really nice...with a name like Hoppy I was hoping B&F didnt disappoint....they didnt!
POSITIVE	12 oz bottle pours a slightly hazed, copper amber body with a small, ivory colored head that retains well and leaves considerable patches of lace down the glass.  Aroma is dominated by a fierce, spruce pine hoppiness.   Mouthfeel has moderate carbonation and coats the palate with hops resins.   Taste features pine hops up front, with some lemon citrus in the background. Just enough caramel malt to keep this smooth and pleasantly drinkable. The bitter pine hops ease up toward the finish, and a smoothness emerges late in the game. Pine resin aftertaste.  Very well crafted, overall, as are most of this brewery's offerings. This one is for the hopheads. There is a hops cone on the label, afterall, but this one could use a bit more malt character for balance.
POSITIVE	This was by far THE best stout I have ever tasted! The alcohol was barely evident in the taste, and the smoothness of this beer was unmatched by any stout i've had thus far.  This may well have ruined my taste for all other stouts as I'm not sure any other could match, or beat it. But!, I'll keep looking.
POSITIVE	This one doesn't need it, but let me add my two cents to the growing accolades.  Poured from 12oz bottle into a 20oz pint glass.  A: Huge head, Lots of tiny bubbles, retention and lacing both long lived.  S: Grapefruit, spicy/pine, and sweet (hint of caramel maybe?)  T: Bitter up front, but mellows out almost immediately with a blast of many complex flavors, then finishes with slight bitter but doesn't linger. (very interesting and very good)  M: light to medium body and bubbles, bubbles, bubbles. But, as others have said: The heavy carbonation is a compliment here and not a turn-off.  D: While by the strictest definition this is not a session beer. In spirit and taste it is. I could and have drank these all night long. And will do so again.  I highly recommend this brew. I have shared Red's Rye with quite a few people (at least 10 people) both men and women and only one had less than great things to say about it. Everyone else said "Do you have any more?" That's 90% approval right there. What more can I say...
NEGATIVE	I love all things Kirkland and am also a big fan of Costco, but I was a little letdown by their Kirkland branded beers. These beers are being made for Costco by Gordon Biersch, and sadly that lineage is clear from the way these beers taste (ZZZZzzz). I thought the amber was the best of the ones I tried, and is a pretty nice but very middle of the road beer. Aroma is discernible, and is lightly malty and pleasant. Color is a copper color with decent head. Flavor is again lightly biscuity with a barely detectable hop note. Mouthfeel is pretty much akin to a full-calorie macro-lager.  Not bad, but I think so highly of other Kirkland products (their ham is terrific!) that I was a little let down by this line of beers. However, I felt this one was the top of the stack.
POSITIVE	A- Pours a deep amber/copper color with a thick off white foam head that leaves some lacing.  S- Rich sweet bourbon aroma.  T- Huge rush of bourbon whiskey flavor. Nice vanilla bean and oak flavors are present in the finish along with a strong sting of alcohol.  M- Creamy feel with nice carbonation and a medium/full body. The alcohol was a bit too strong for my tastes.  D- Overall this beer tastes just like I expected. This seems to be Dirty Bastard aged in bourbon barrels and that is exactly what I got.
NEGATIVE	Poured into the Sam Adams glass.  A - Pours a dark honey colored almost brownish with a off white head that is about 2 fingers. A lot of carbonation rising up from the bottom.  S - WOW smells liked salami! Its true. Some faint sweet maltiness comes out. Spicy.  T - Very interesting smoked meat taste. Some beef jerky and a bit of pepperoni as well. Im not joking. Some mild bitterness at the end with a bit of dryness. Aftertaste completely smoked! Wheat isn't really coming through some hints of clove but not so preset.  M - Light to medium bodied not too complex but very interesting.  D - Not my favorite style of beer. Definitely interesting and not bad but not my favorite.  Edit: As it warms some of the wheat character is a lot more present with some spicyness and clove character more noticeable.
NEGATIVE	Road kill is your marketing plan? Pours a mostly haze light amber color. Quite carbonated with a big bubbly head that did have some staying power. Though did not last through the tasting and limited lacing.  The nose is on par for an East Coast IPA. Some citrus notes mix with more of a earthy complexity. The malt really comes out with a stronger caramel and some sweet bread notes. Some off yeast characteristics as well. Noticeable alcohol and tropical fruity notes. Some DMS and minor butyric notes as well. Would really like more hops in the nose.  The taste is similar or if not more malt oriented. The caramel backs off as more of a bready and grainy flavor comes out. Some bitterness but doesn't balance well with the sweeter malt taste. The finishing hops have a nice citrus finish with a mix between orange and grapefruit but the aftertaste leaves a soapy almost earthy finish that is a bit off. This is accented with a bit of off yeast notes. Noticeable alcohol and butyric notes.  The body is closer to moderate than light. Carbonation is a bit light but ok. Some soapy notes leaves a slight filmy finish. Overall I would have liked more kettle hop flavors and aromas, and some noticeable yeast notes are bit of a deterrent but easy to drink.
NEGATIVE	Founders- Devil Dancer  Purchased from Capone's- Norristown, PA  A- Hazy reddish orange with a small sticky one ring lacing head. S- Strong fruits, cherry and grape. Thick rich caramel malt with a hint of alcohol. T- Huge burning alcohol with a wallop of cherry, prune, and grape fruit. Big bitter green(wet) hops in the end.  M- Sweet with a burning alcohol flavor until the end where bitter hops take over.  Overall- At first this kicks your ass, but half way through the strong alc calms down in your mouth and the flavor pops.
POSITIVE	BA REVIEW #100  (Saved something a little special for my 100th review)   12oz. bottle, chilled and poured into a snifter, 2011 vintage.  Appearance- Pours black as midnight, one of if not the darkest beers I have ever seen to this day. Gentle pour yields a very small bubbly top that very quickly disappears into the darkness with a very very small ring around the glass, you almost have to search for any type of head left over after the pour, leaving   Smell- Im getting huge amounts of bitter coffee aromas right off the bat paired with that woody bourbon aroma, mild dark chocolate in there as well with some sweet hints of vanilla and a mild touch of roasted malt in the nose.  Taste- Holy shite this thing will put hair on your chest, wow what an adventure for the palate! First off I get a milk chocolate flavour paired with the alcohol bite from the bourbon, very sweet with hints of vanilla in there as well, lots of roasted bitter coffee notes coming through next with a mild touch of roasted malts in there as well.  Mouthfeel- Full bodied and smooth as silk, creamy and goes down as sexy as red velvet cake, very little to no carbonation but the tastes more than make up for the lack of carbonation.  Overall- I think only one word can describe this beer; amazing! It deserves all the hype and score that it has here on BA, this is easily one of the best stouts in the entire word. Everything about this beer is absolutely stunning, from the initial kick of the bourbon in the tastes balanced perfectly by the coffee, chocolate milk, vanilla, and woody flavours to the amazing smells right down to the feel of it on the palate. This is a world class beer for a reason, all other stouts take notes because this is what you should taste like, and hides the big ABV extremely well. Will always search this one out and drink it every day if I could, theres nothing more to say, 5/5, A+ all day everyday.
POSITIVE	Pours a cloudy burnt sienna color with some particulates. 1/2 inch of light tan head dissipates quickly leaving spotty lacing. Smells of caramel, orange peel, and grapefruit. Taste is citrusy up front with a nice caramel sweet malty backbone and a nice dried grass/slightly piney dry finish. Medium in body and smooth with good carbonation and a nice balance. A decent APA with some characteristics that have it more like a weaker IPA, I wouldn't mind having another one of these.
POSITIVE	I poured this beer right down the center of the glass, there was a little head that disappears quickly. This stuff is THICK. This is my second one today, I let this one warm up to room temperature and I am very glad I did. Smell is huge coffee and chocolate. Taste is huge coffee flavor and chocolate. The mouthfeel is super thick and creamy which might be my favorite part of this beer. Drinkability is huge for such a high ABV brew. An all around excellent beer!
POSITIVE	Colossal thanks to ericwo for tossing a couple of these my way! Served in a chalice on Xmas Eve.  Pours an inky black with a thin, off white head.  Nice amount of bourbon, chocolate and vanilla in the snout. Mabye some char as well.  Mmmm. Tastes like a chocolate brownie! The darker, harder corners that are just about to burn. The barrel aging makes this thing so damn smooth as well. Unbelievably silky mouthfeel.  The drinkability is off the charts for a big beer such as this. A good dessert beer for sure, but this sucker will work for me any time, any place. I'm looking forward to sitting on my other bottle another year and seeing how it progresses!
NEGATIVE	200 ml bottle....pours a semi-cloudy brownish with zero head and very minimal carbonation....  the nose was sweet, some brown sugar and spicey fruit....taste was sweet initially...molasses and brown sugar, some spice came through mid-sip, alcohol kick moderte off the back end....mouthfeel was somewhat sticky, almost flat due to the lack of carbonation...a little too sweet and lack of mouthfeel to give it better drinkability  as a side note, this beer was the perfect companion with Pralines & Cream ice cream
POSITIVE	was really excited to pop this one open after all the praises i had heard...  A - poured a rich thick milky black with a thin tan head. really gorgeous. you can see the oaty thickness. in my opinion you simply can't make a more appetizing and appealing RIS. leaves a nice snail trail of lacing on the glass that slowly crawls home.  S - very chocolaty and oaty. nutty and roasted malts but not in the typical coffee and wood way but rather thick and once again oaty. There is a subtle alcohol thing going on in the back ground that refreshes the nose with a mentholated feel.  T/M/D - oh wow. it all leads up to that first sip and no disappointment at all. its a very filling and rich RIS in every way. it has the full bodied thickness of a mature oatmeal stout. the flavor is essentially all roasted malt. it's a meal in a 12oz glass let alone a 22oz bottle. but damn good beer. new style - RIOS. all though oatmeal spin adds some fantastic flavor and body it really is a bit filling. drinking two of these would be like drinking two milkshakes. mmm...milkshakes.  --- EDIT --- 2011-11-06 Cellar Aged BORIS (with "cellar aged 1 Yr" sticker on the neck of the bottle. It is actually probably 2+ years old at this point, but I suppose the brewery released cellar aged version at some point? bottle also had a sticker that says "17497"  a - opened the bottle and filled my cbs snifter. poured sludgy black. not much head and what was there was gone quick. looks thick and delicious. 4  s - dhocolate roasted malts. perfectly mellow and balanced. the roastiness is perfectly paired with the chocolate. also has a touch of a briskness to it. 4.5  t - ah yes...BORIS!!! love this beer. rich thick chocolatey bold roastiness. really well rounded. 4.5  m - here's where i feel the cellaring has done the beer some good. i remember this beer as a monster on fullness and this aged version is quite silky and smooth. much more of a softer oatmeal stout. 4.5  o - overall just a great beer. time does nice for this one...one of my favs. 4.5
POSITIVE	Honey amber pour, with a fluffy head that leaves very little lace.  Sulfury grassy caramel malts in the nose. Not bad, but smells a bit cheap.  Sweet and grainy up front, mellows into an inoffensive bittersweet caramel.  Low to medium bodied, this is a nice drinking beer. Not the best Oktoberfest, but surely worth looking for.
POSITIVE	One of my favorites. This is what I compare other Imperial Stouts to.  what an Oatmeal Stout should be. Smooth and full of flavor. Award winning for a reason.  Well worth it. a must try. I love many beers but too lazy I am only mentioning A+ ones.  Hoppin' Frog is one of my favorite brewers thanks to this awesome brew.
POSITIVE	Pours nearly perfectly into my Sam Adams glass. Appealing dense tan head over a dark amber elixar of thick and rich cooper and garnet. Malty aroma with rich sweetness, almost sugary that slowly fades to mild alcohol mixed with vanilla, oak and very mild bourbon. Hints of toast and caramel. Now this one has that balance right, at least in the aroma. Thick and heavy lacing marks the drinks. So much of the balance stays into the flavor, except the alcohol shows a bit of a bite, with a mild burning and isn't blended as well. Too bad. Flavors pretty much mimic the aroma. They also smooth out in time and seem less harsh, but the emphasis on alcohol remains too great for my tastes. This has a great feel. Soft yet full. Heavier body and very smooth. This actually comes to drink lighter than the initial alcohol blast would propose. Three out of five categories this is a very good beer.
NEGATIVE	Poured from 12oz bottle into shaker pint glass.  Appearance: Very, very pale straw color with a small, think white head that dissipates quickly and leaves no sign of lace.  Smell: Actually has a strong smell for a light beer- sweet grain maybe some corn hints, and grassy hops.  Taste: Begins with grassy hop flavors, finishing with sweet grains and a hint of corn.  Mouthfeel: Thin with sharp carbonation and a watery, refreshing finish.  Drinkability: This is one of the better, more flavorful beers for its style, actually. A beer I wouldn't seek out, but I'd drink it again if it were offered. Of course this doesn't stand up to the best craft brews, but it is a good beer for its style- though there are better light beers out there.
POSITIVE	Pours a hazy orange amber color with a tight, off-white head that leaves a good amount of lacing.  Smells of loads of citrus and pine hops.  Tastes of delicious hops with a solid malt backbone. Hops are characterized by grapefruit and lemon, with some pine resin. Notes of grass appear as well. Malt is subdued, but offers a touch of bread with some caramel notes to sweeten things up. Leans towards bitter as it should.   Mouthfeel is medium with a crisp amount of carbonation.
POSITIVE	Ok...well since I could not make it out to TPH for this gem on tap, I had to pull this one out of the cellar...this bottle is courtesy of the very generous malty. Pours a deep dark black with no light passing thru...a 1/4 finger of cocoa colored head sits there for a few minutes and leaves behind some decent lacing. Huge coffee profile in the nose...like the most freshest Breakfast stout you could possibly imagine. Deep roast espresso, liquor, not much oak hitting me at this point. Yeah...no mistaking this one for the regular Breakfast Stout...immense coffee with a beautiful blend of vanilla, oak, and bourbon...gets better with each sip honestly. The malt sweetness is divine and masks the alcohol very well...it does warm you up quickly though. Mouthfeel is thick and creamy...carbonation low and great for this brew. Definitely a sipper, but I would never get bored of this flavor...simply divine. Too bad the bottles did not make it to our area...there is always hope for next year.
POSITIVE	This beer seems to make it to every RIS fan, and it is worth what you trade/buy for it.   Poured into a tulip glass. Smell was amazing, and what I expected after wanting to try it for some time. Smell of chocolate and roasted malts swirled throughout the glass. Oaky and and slight bourbon floated on the palate. Genuine beer lives up to its reputation. Small head lingered for the first few sips. Great beer to chill to. Smoother and sweeter as it cooled down. Great 'til the last sip. Savored every moment.
POSITIVE	A - Pours a thick black color with a thin caramel head. Leaves a coffee colored ring that almost encircles the glass.   S - Scents of dark chocolate, roasted coffee and dark fruits. Reminded me of figs.   T - Taste overcomes with dark roasty chocolate and some fig fruit taste.  M - Well balanced and smooth. You can feel the thickness of it on your tongue.   D - A very tasteful stout. Should of gotten more of these.
POSITIVE	Appearance  Hahahaha! The pudgy Quaker Oats baby on the label just had me laughing my a** off. Sorry for the irrelevant remark, but that is some funny s**t!  Anyway, the beer pours a dark, murky brown thats almost black in color. The head is heavily-tanned and leaves some nice lacing.  Smell  The nose is very, very bitter and laden with spent coffee grounds along with bakers chocolate and maybe a pinch of brown sugar. Man, is this a good smell. Its not roasted malts but more like pure used coffee.  Taste  This tastes as good as it smells. It is very dry and bitter and, again, like a mouth full of coffee grounds but without the granular texture. There is a bit of milky cream in the taste that I missed at the nose. It truly is a stout for breakfast and, seriously, would taste well over cereal.  It also reminds me of a chocolate martini, if youve ever had one of those. This really is quality all the way. Its not malty at all and is in a class all by itself.  Mouthfeel  This is on the large side of medium-bodied, but still medium-bodied, with a nice creaminess in between the cheeks. I really enjoyed the fact that it didnt finish with a sugar rush like some examples of the breakfast stout style.  Drinkability  This is not one to guzzle or session but more to sip on like I do with my morning coffee. Its one of the better stouts that Ive had.  Comments  Big thanks to one of my favorite trading partners, garthwaite, for sending this one my way.
POSITIVE	I tried to pour this one into a Duvel glass but broke it when it slip out of my wet hands - already a mark against this one! Then poured into a Piraat glass (no sense in risking my other two Duvel glasses). The color is a cloudy pink grapefruit color with a light head despite the hearty carbonation. I really had to pour it with vigor to form a head on this one.  The smell is grainy with absolutely no fruit aroma whatsoever. I was expecting to be knocked down by fruit esters but alas nothing. I think Founders should have added some cherries to the final boil and maybe even add some crushed fruit to the bottle to add a little more cherry essence.  The flavors are amazing. You obviously get cherry but you also get tart citrus, dry pinot grigio notes, oaky chardonay, and dried fruit. If this were wild fermented it would be a major hype beer - something to think about Founders.  Mouthfeel is light but a touch undercarbonated for me. I would also like a more creamy consistency with the fruit beers - Boone does this nicely. I would imagine this would be fantastic on tap with nitrogen.  Drinkability is high because it's fruity, cold, and light in the mouth. On a hot day this is a great summer beer.
POSITIVE	Thanks to zoso1967 for supplying this tasty brew!  Appearance: Poured from a 12oz can into a large wine glass. This beer ranges in color from golden at the bottom of the glass, to ruby/amber at the top. There's a nice pillowy, khaki one-finger head that recedes at a snail's pace. Great lacing clings to the edges of the glass. Some moderate carbonation is visible in the glass.  Smell: Citrus and pine hop aroma is offset by some sweeter fruit scents and nice caramel malt presence. I'm also getting a touch of bready influence.  Taste: The hops are pretty unrelenting in this one. The malt holds its own though, and breaks through the bitterness a bit at the end. There is actually a touch of sugary sweetness just as the bitterness wears off. The influence is brief and barely finds its way through the hops, but it is a nice counterpoint to the bitter onslaught.  Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied and extremely well balanced. The hops are strong enough to state their case, but subdued enough to let the other flavors have their turn.  Drinkability: A very solid, session-beer contender. I love the can too!
POSITIVE	A nice six pack. Available to me when I went to Illinois  Pours a nice ruddy brown with a creamy head and good lacing.  Nose is hops spice and grapefruit.  Taste is really nice with good strong hop profile, grapefruits and spice. A hint of malt and a sweet finish.  Really creamy mouth feel, which is a favorite.   Easy to drink and very good offering.
POSITIVE	A -copper with a small head from an aggressive pour  S - sweet malts and grapefruit hops, with a dash of pine  T - hops, hops, and hops (no wonder considering it is brewed with 10 hop varieties). Very sweet malts are balanced by a boatload of citrus, followed by piney, hops. This is pretty sweet and not very bitter, which is a good thing given the amount of hops in this thing. Surprisingly, the 12% abv is extremely well masked.   M - smooth and full...goes down too nicely for a beer of this strength  D - for a triple IPA, this was a lot more drinkable than I thought. As mentioned, it wasn't too bitter or over the tops with hops; rather it is sweet and well-balanced. Very drinkable and delicious for a beer of this strength.
POSITIVE	Beer pours orange/copper in copper is color with a nice 1 finger head that fades to a slight lacing. Decent lacing left in glass. Smell is very floral with a grapefruit/citrus aroma. Sweet caramel malt is also present. Initial taste is a sweet caramel that is followed by a nice citrus/grapefruit taste that finishes slightly grassy. Mouth feel is good, not too much carbonation and alcohol is well hidden.  A good beer. Not sure I like it more than the Centennial IPA they offer, but that's me. The hops are nicely complemented by the sweet malt in the beer but not too much overpower what should be the focus of any good DIPA...the hops.
POSITIVE	A 750 mL corked and caged bottle purchased at the brewery about a year ago. Since then I've cellared it in my basement.  A: The stout opened with a pop, a nice start compared to the BA Old Abominable that I had last weekend. After the pop, a thick head formed in my glass, approaching 3 fingers of bubbly goodness. The stout is a deep brown-black color lacking any form of clarity.  S: The nose is relaxed, lacking a big defining scent from either the double stout or the barrel aging. What does come out does so as the ale warms and has a pleasing chocolate-bourbon combination. It doesn't sound appealing but it really is.  T: The stout is silky sweet, lacking all any abrasive biting characteristics. Soft chocolate flavors define the stout side. They are sweet with a darker, burnt taste that is not overly bitter. Mid-sip the whiskey barrel flavors becomes apparent, wiith a strong vanilla presence that has touches of buttery sweetness. Not a great deal bourbon-wise, but what does emerge is pleasing. I like the subtlety of the barrel, it is not as in-your-face as some versions are.  M: The barrel aging was done conservatively and I really appreciate that. The vanilla flavors are a nice attribute as a result of that aging. The stout has mellowed out significantly, greatly assisting the feel.  D: The high alcohol is well hidden, rarely popping up. The interaction between barrel and stout is well done.
POSITIVE	12oz bottle poured into a goblet  A: Almost pitch black with just a hint of brown. One finger of head that quickly fades to a ring around the glass.  S: Very nice. Smoke and peat start off, almost like I'm smelling a scotch without the alcohol. In the background, I get a hint of dark cherry. The more I smell, the more dark cherry I get. I get some coffee and a bit of milk chocolate, too. Intriguing, and quite nice.  T: Wow. So complex. Again, lots of peat and dark cherry. It's well supported by some hop bitterness and a healthy portion of dark and milk chocolate. This is unlike any smoked beer I've ever had. I usually love the bacon bombs, and even though this is far from that it's quite amazing.  M: I wouldn't change a thing. Fairly thick and silky smooth with good carb.  O: I am extremely surprised by this beer. I have been passively seeking it out for some time, but I had no idea it'd taste like this, and no idea I'd like a beer so much with this flavor profile. Far beyond expectations. This is not your run of the mill Smoked Porter.
NEGATIVE	Well I've passed this brew over a few times, but after seeing some hype on the threadmill concerning this brew, I figured I'd try this one out finally...  Poured this one into a newly acquired cognac sniffer I got from work and it doesn't look too bad. Only mildly hazy (I expected total opaqueness, but I can see through this brew a bit. The head presentation is minimal, but with a finger thick foam that dwindles to fine lacing in no time of an off white color.  The aroma is thick with grapefruit hops aroma, a lot of caramel malt quality, and a dry aridness all the way around.  Taste wise the caramel flavor coats the tongue quite a bit, with a thick syrupy sweetness that warms the palate quite. The hops kick in immediately after that split second and prick my taste buds with spruce and a kick of bourbon like flavors.  Altogether this is a rich complex beer with lots of alcohol kind of tainting the beer. I like this beer, but the domination of the ethyl is a bit much.
NEGATIVE	Poured a 500ml bottle into my New Belgium globe.  This beer pours a clear tangerine orange with almost no head even though I gave it a vigerous pour. Big fish eye bubbles started but nothing after those dissapeared. No lacing and no head retention. Not a good start but I've seen beers come back from that. The nose is, well, sweet. Not a good malty sweet, almost like a Karo syrup sweet. Like a fake sweetness. Not much else. Just a hint of graininess. Mostly watered down Karo syrup. The flavor is right up the same alley. Sweet Karo syrup with just a hint of lemony hops and just a tiny big of graininess on the back end of the palate. Really, not that good. The mouthfeel is neither good nor bad. Not really anything. More or less like drinking a glass of water. Overall, all I can say is I need to stop picking up bottles for their bottle caps. You have a tendency to grab crappy beers.
POSITIVE	Presentation: A very distinctive looking, and rather uniquely sized bottle at 1 Pint, 9.87 fluid ounces, or 765ml if youre into metric units. A single orange label on the front has a picture of a rather attractive blue eyed beauty decorated with ears of wheat. Simply described as Stoudts Weizen, Unfiltered Wheat Beer with no additives or preservatives. A smudged, For best flavor drink by date, which looks like 11/2/03.  Appearance: Slightly hazy looking golden-straw color with a large frothy white head. The head soon snap, crackle and pops itself away to a thin covering leaving no lacing at all. Medium levels of inherent carbonation.  Nose: A floral wheaty nose with a slight candy aspect to it.  Taste: Sweetish malts with a wheat grain feel in the beginning. Floral aspects mixed with a hint of cloves and some banana tinges. Finishes with a light citric sweetness in the end. Lots of flavors, that never wane.  Mouthfeel: A very lively feeling on the tongue at the start rescinds as the levels of carbonation falls. Medium in strength.  Drinkability: Another winner for me, I thoroughly enjoyed finishing off the entire bottle all on my own whilst sitting on the balcony.   Overall: A solid Weizen, which is an easy drinker and certainly exhibits many aspects of a finely crafted brew. Thanks to NF for this one.
POSITIVE	A musky glowing russet brown with a slim capping of tanned froth. Keeps a good collar with a few straggly branched arms of lace sticking across the glass.  Astounding aroma of maple, honey, oak soaked bourbon. Heavy, heavy, inviting as hell, warm whiskey tone to this sucker. Wow. Wonderful.  Smooth and warming with a good source of whiskey tones behind some maple, honey, vanilla, and white grape accents. Tenderly toasted malt background but huge in malted girth and warmth of gooey rich and thick caramel, maple, toffee, and minor fruityness all encompassed by one very nice powering warmth of whiskey oaken woodyness. No real finishing qualities however as it slides off the back end with an unwanted speed before the warmth sets in with just a slight backburst of crisp vanilla and left over whiskey wood.  Feel is warm, and more warm, and more warm. Strange how some beers with more then 9.3% seem to have no omff while this screams it. Big, bold, and beautiful; rich, smooth, and full. The only set back is the forementioned finish which is escapingly ghostly and parting in a manner that throws a curve in its overall, powering presence.  Be that as it may, that is what makes this quite a drinkable, dandy treat. For if it were all but power and strength, this would not be as easy to handle and may as well just be whiskey at that point.  A very nice Old Ale. Fulfilling and dreamy.
POSITIVE	Pours black and thick, almost syrup like, and has a hint of head that quickly diminishes.  Smells of coffee, vanilla, chocolate, perhaps a bit of biscuit.  Taste is a nice bouquet of flavor. Maple syrup and caramel make up the sweetness that great you at first. The chocolate and vanilla dance around letting you know that they're there, but not quite sure of where in the mix they come in. It's sweet but gives way to a dose of malt and plenty of coffee in the end.  Fills your mouth, and your gut. It's a smooth, thick brew.  Obviously this beer is awesome. Period. I kept thinking about pouring it over pancakes.
NEGATIVE	Having recently had a rauchbier on tap at the other side, this one caught my eye today in the beer store. 16.9oz brown bottle. Pours a chestnut brown with visible carbonation and small whitish head that quickly dissipates. The smell is great, smoky as expected immediately calling to mind backyard bbq's and fireplaces. Taste follows especially up front but back end has some smoother maltiness. Agree with other reviews that mouthefeel is somewhat thin and would not be able to go for more than 1 of these, but an excellent beer nonetheless.
POSITIVE	1/2 liter can.   Pour puts a golden bright lager in the flute...decent 2 finger white frothy cap, fair retention, good lacing. Well carbonated.   Aroma of herbal-citrus bouquet under bready malts ( very decent aroma).   Medium bodied, soft mineral mouth feel...meaty pale malt backbone.   Starts a tad sharp from the carbonation ( too sparkling/spritzy) but once past that you can chew into the bready Moravian malts...then the balance from both saaz and Lublin hopping comes in and you get a nice bread and lemon decernment under a more creamy mouth feel. Finishes crisp and clean with the bittering dropping right off to leave a light bready-biscuity taste and virtually no sweetness. The 5.2 ABV makes this a very drinkable and satisfying beer.   This is an above average Polish lager and I am surprised I like it as well, if not more so, than Okocim Zagloba....and at $1.75 for 1/2 liter you wanna know this is gonna be in my fridge...it's a bargain at that price.
POSITIVE	a: if it were any darker it would be black instead of brown. no head or lacing just a little mocha colored ring on top.  s: bourbon, bourbon and more bourbon. there is also a little coffee and vanilla in there but mostly bourbon.  t: wow more bourbon. the coffee peeks thru a little, very well blended.  m: nice and smooth, a little burn from the alochol. has a full body with a creamy feel to it.  o: very impressed with the balance of this beer. i was expecting to be doing shots of bourbon but this is so much more.
NEGATIVE	On-tap at O'Reilly's during Think Tank.  A: The double IPA is golden and translucent, a nice looking ale that sits patiently (with a stream of bubbles) in the tumbler. A half a finger of white head lasts for most of the glass, leaving lace behind.  S: The nose is loaded with orange and citrus fruits, ripe and sweet. Biscuity malt is present but the boozy intensity of the bitterness is the star.  T: Initially the hops fire on all cylinders, delivering orange and citrus flavors, a dash of pepper and heat. Mid-sip, the biscuit becomes more evident before the hops come roaring back with a vegetal finish, very pulpy. I was on board until the finish where the ale seems to slide off track.  M: The mouthfeel is strong, especially upfront. The latter stages have a nondescript hoppiness that is nowhere near the bite of the front.  O: A good DIPA that meanders. Come for the first hop blasts that it offers.
NEGATIVE	on tap at the brewery, arrived with a fairly minor light tan head, muddy medium brownish amber, a few sips reveals nice looking window paines of lace. Mild leafy hop nose. Easy drinking IPA, respectable hop presence, but not ever reaching above a Brit. style level. Magnum, Simcoe and cascades advertized here, but the hops seemed a tad muted to call this one an AIPA. Perhaps "Vermont style", but not close to a freshy SD style IPA. Eh, worth a try but nothing special going on here.
POSITIVE	Pours a deep, dark mahogany color - clear with a lush, frothy head that begins leaving stringy sheets of lace before I even have a sip. Deep, smooth dark fruit aromas along with toffee, chocolate, alcohol, and a bit of licorice...very dark and vinous overall. Huge, rich, malty sweet flavor - alcoholic dark fruits and toasty malts. Molasses and toffee covered purple fruits. Big, smooth, and slick.  This is a particularly rich Baltic Porter. Very dark, dense, and well crafted.
POSITIVE	500ml bottle bought from GapWines, Belfast...  Poured a deep coppery orange / amber colour... light creamy tan head poured fairly thick then faded quite quickly to light layer. Light lacing... Sparse carbonation...  Aroma - Lightly toasted caramel maltiness, biscuity, nice juicy fruits (oranges, pears, figs, some raisins), some nutty sweetness, grassy, light spicy / floral hops, some bready notes, light cinnamon traces...  Taste  Nice juicy tart fruits (oranges, apples, light figs, some grapefruits), light toffee sweetness, definite nuttiness, spicy hop bitterness, some nutmeg notes, toasted bread, nice biscuitiness..  Feel - Initially sharp then mellows out....Medium body... Very very quaffable - a perfect session beer...  Overall - A world class bitter - one of my favourites... Recommended !!
NEGATIVE	12 oz bottle poured into nonic pint glass.  Whoa! The IBU's in this beer must be through the pint! I'm pretty happy I found a few rack spots offering a few brews from this brewery. I only read about Stoudt's brewery/restaurant & pub a few days ago and assumed it was sit in/take out only, not distributed. Glad I was wrong.  The APA from Stoudt's is amber-orange, and forms a strong, egg white, robust head with excellent lacing. The smell is a tiny bit sour, a little more sweet. The taste is pretty bitter, with a lot of hops handling their business. They're more dry than floral, with some grapefruit characteristics coming through in the finish.  The head retention is one of the most notable elements to this brew. The taste and overall feel is unquestionably first in line. Cheers!
NEGATIVE	This double ale was new in Atlanta so I bought a bottle from Total Wine, poured into a pint glass:  A: Dark brown color, finger-width of head with minimal lacing  S: Roasted with malty undertones, a bit of hops is there too  T: Also savory, like soy sauce with dry finish.   M: Medium bodied, carbonation was biting enough  D: Definitely not a taste I'd like to repeat, too roasted, not malty enough, and hops only contributed to bitterness.
POSITIVE	A: Appearance is amber color with light, off-white head that has good lacing.   S: Aroma is heavy citrus with a slight caramel sweetness and floral hop notes.   T: Taste has prevalent citrus flavors especially grapefruit and lemon with a sharp, piney hops throughout.   M: Palate is light to medium-bodied, slightly watery, lively carbonation, and a bitter finishing.   O: A very good IPA.
POSITIVE	Pours clear reddish dark amber with slightly off white head with good retention, patchy downsliding lacing. Aroma is smoked ham and sausage with hints of caramel malt; it is interesting that this beer I bought in Latvia has much more intense aroma than the beer I had in Schlenkerla Tavern in Bamberg a few months ago.  Taste is rich with intricate combination of rich smoked malt that clearly dominates, but is not overpowering other flavours, ham and oak with semi-dry finish and faint smoky aftertaste. Mouthfeel is medium with less than moderate carbonation and subtle alcohol warming.  Amazing beer with excellent drinkability.
NEGATIVE	Bottle into Sam Adams lager glass.  Pours jet black with a dense, one finger brown head. Head gradually turns rocky and pitted, eventually settling into a nice creamy cap after a long time. Solid brown walls of lacing - this is how a porter is supposed to look.   Nose is light espresso mixed with some delicious hot chocolate action going on.   Espresso up front, a bit of roasty acidity along with a light hop bitterness, with some nice cocoa emerging around mid palate, surrounded by an expanding, roasty, coffee presence. Licorice makes its presence known as well. Interesting and complex - the light roasty acidity seems to accompany every aspect of the taste, wrapping itself around and moving between the other flavors. Maybe a bit too much. Still, nicely done.  Mouthfeel - medium bodied, very softly carbonated, gets a bit watery as it warms, which is a disappointment. Lighter body than expected (and preferred) as a result. Wateriness means the drinkability score suffers a bit too.
NEGATIVE	Pours a darkish brown/red without much head. Lacing shows up down the glass. Smell is of smoky meat. Extra smokey bacon was my first thought. Tastes of smoke and a little malt. Has a slight peaty flavor. Really quite smokey. Slight bitter finish. This is my first Rauchbier and boy is it like nothing else. Still not sure if it is a style for me. Drinkability is limited because of the strong smoke. If you like real smokey flavors, I think you would really enjoy this. It was a little too extreme in the smokiness for me but I am glad I tried it.
NEGATIVE	Presentation: 12 oz bottle into an nonic. Big thanks to "beveritt" for bringing this back from god knows where.  A- Quite hazy light copper. Pours with ~1/2 a finger of off-white head, which fades quickly into a thin smattering of islands. Poor head/retention. Minimal lacing.  S- Somewhat herbaceous hopiness. Slightly sweet notes, and hints of grainy/corn emerge as the beer settles and warms slightly.  T- A bit cidery, slightly tangy citrus-peel bitterness. Ok, but not quite coming together.  M- Moderate carbonation. Moderately light feel with a fair amount of hop oil slickness.  D- Decent. Not terribly interesting in smell or taste, but would be easy enough to mindlessly pound a few..  Future outlook: OK and drinkable, but nothing to crow about...and not available here....so no future outlook...
POSITIVE	A: pours a pale gold with a 2 finger white head that reduces ro a thin film and leaves some decent lacing. Tiny particles visible on close inspection.  S: very intersting olive oil, rosemary-like aroma (smells like a fresh baked specialty pizza crust!). A bit of grassiness in the backgroud as well.  T: Again, quite prominent herbal flavours thats are semi-sweet and quite buttery as well - all around, a good maltiness to this beer and not too much hopping.   M: light and quite creamy, good amount of carbonation and a smooth, somewhat oily finish.  D: this is a very interesting euro lager - I like it because it is very different - less hops, more malts and a herbal aroma and flavour that provides for a truly unique taste experience. I would definitely reccoment that all BA`s try this beer. It reminds me somewhat of the Fraoch Heather Ale... quite nice indeed.
POSITIVE	Poured into a Weizen glass.  A: Super cloudy deep straw. A big eggshell head starts strong and sticks around. Leaves a fair amount of lace.  S: Lots of lemon and clove, plus a bit of banana.  T: Tart and dry. Starts with a dry biscuit flavor. Bitterness is there with a mild lemon and clove bite. Banana resides in the background. Finishes with a lingering clove flavor.  M: The body feels grainy, with a high level of biting carbonation.  D: A nice Hefe overall. I'm glad I picked it up.
POSITIVE	A: Thick and oily pour. Faint head that disappears pretty quick.  S: Molasses, dark fruit and chocolate and roasted malts.  T: Can definitely tell this is a high abv beer. A hint of coffee in the flavor but the chocolate prevails over that and the dark fruit flavor. Little hop bite in the end.  M: Not as heavy as it looks and there is some alcohol warmth that I enojoy.  O: I like this stout alot and if I could do two reviews of one beer I would do a aged one these also.
NEGATIVE	Appearance - A nice ruby brown with a tiny short lasting tanish head.  Smell - An interesting woody scent mixed with whiskey and A scent of currents and grapes. Alcohol in the scent is a little heavier than I like but otherwise pretty good.  Taste - Woody with a good malt base. Lots of whiskey and alcohol taste here. Some raisen or Currentlike fruitness too. Good bitter chocolate flavor as well.  Mouthfeel - Nice and smooth and creamy with low carbonation. Very nice feel to this fellow.  Drinkability - Too much flavor to drink more than one in a night but a pretty good old ale. I will have it again.
POSITIVE	Tasted on 09/02/11. From notes:  Appearance: Pretty significant white foamy head that struggles to stay around but fades within a minute or so. Small layer sits on top as it goes down. Medium-gold, with the slightest haziness. Moderate amount of lacing.  Smell: Mainly hops, with lots of spiciness and some fruity notes. Malt and wheat are both present and add a toasted, biscuit-like aroma. Light lemony-citrus aroma as well.  Taste: Opens with a rather mild bitterness and spicy hop flavor, followed by some sweet pale malts and wheat. The wheat is relatively faint but its inherent characteristics are unmistakable. Fruity notes really take over the finish. Sweet in the middle, but overall well balanced.  Mouthfeel: Full, almost creamy body with a very soft but active carbonation. Alcohol is not present at all. A bit of a wet and lingering, slightly bitter, and almost sticky finish.  Overall: I had a hard time deciphering this beer, though I'm not really sure why. Probably warrants a second taste. I guess Id call it more of an English IPA with a twist, or even just a rather hoppy pale ale. The hops are there, the grain bill is great, but as a whole this beer is lacking oomph. Not displeasing in the least, but not really fantastic at the same time.
POSITIVE	Thanks to jzmaxson27 for trading me this beer!  A: Very, very dark brown. Pretty much no light can get through any part of my tulip. Not much by way of head. Brown colored and immediately dissipated.  S: Primarily I smell coffee and rich dark chocolate. It's incredibly inviting.   T: First thing this does is remind me of my daily morning black, french press coffee. Huge, beautiful bitter coffee flavor. This is immediately balanced by some of the residual sugars and the rich maltiness. This turns into some milk chocolate. Finish is long and bitter that's mostly dark chocolate but does have a hint of hop bitterness.  M: Huge body that's incredibly smooth.  O: Totally lives up to the hype! I'd put this a step above Speedway. It's extremely complex when it warms, but even the outright flavors of chocolate and coffee are so rich and delicious.
POSITIVE	Poured this 16.9 oz. undated brown bottle into a .5L becker. The dark tan head rose to over 4 fingers before I had to stop pouring. I waited a little while before I was able to complete the pour. Head was massive, a tight latte-like foam that slowly faded.  Smell was impressive too. Clean toasty grains. Hints of molasses and metal. Faint soy sauce aroma. Wood. Multi-layered and interesting.  Taste was like a puzzle...so much going on here and so much fun to decipher. Toasty roasty malts are up front. While the meek hops wish to rise the sweet malts gently disuade the assertion. Chocolate covered raisins and cherries are present. A bit of cough syrup flavor is noted. Alcohol gently appears in the flavor and smell as is warms. Slightly smoky aftertaste.  Mouthfeel is smooth and slightly slick. Low to medium carbonation.   This brew is very complex in aroma and flavor. Rewarding. The alcohol is 8.3% ABV but it is very well hidden. I feel it but the ETOH smell and taste are barely noticeable. I would recommend this offering.
POSITIVE	Pours almost black with red tints a creamy head, nice lacing, and good retention.  The aroma is of black coffee, dark chocolate, roasted malts, and citrus tang.  The front is of dark chocolate and coffee,caramel, and roasted malts which melt away for a dry, crisp, citrus finish of grapefruit and orange rind. Nicely balanced.  A bit thin, but overall smooth and easy to drink.  Very interesting balance and enjoyable beer.
POSITIVE	Aecht Schlenkerla Eiche  500ml Bottle into Balloon Tulip  Amber orange with a large off white head. Clinging lace as it settles.  This beer smells like glazed ham in the nicest of ways. Smokiness is sweet with hints of crispy sweet glazed pork skin, maple smoked bacon with hints of toffee.  Flavor follows aroma with the same "meatiness." Full bodied with huge hits of sweet oak smoke, crispy bacon and roasted ham. The sweet maltiness evens out the savory quality of this beer and balances nicely.  This paired nicely with the steak salad I was eating. Fantastically flavorful and unique--Schlenkerla makes the best smoked beers in the world with this one as a shining example of how to do it right.
POSITIVE	A: hazy golden orange, diminishing white head, decent lacing. S: citric, floral, spicy hops and doughy/yeasty malt. just a bit muted overall. T: lightly sweet crackery, bready pale malts are balanced out by a smooth hop bitterness. a bit astringent in the dry, crisp finish. hop flavors linger a bit. M: light bodied, frothy, crisp, drying. D: very drinkable, a nice summer-y beer.
POSITIVE	22oz bottle poured into a Duvel glass.  A: Jet black. Opaque, no light gets through this bad boy. Descent tan head that dissipates down into a thin ring around the glass. No real lacing to be found. I'd assume with an oatmeal stout, imperial or not, that I would get more head and lacing.   S: Pretty much what I find to be a standard RIS smell. Dark chocolate, some burnt sugar, dark fruit, but a pleasant oat smell once it warms up. Nothing to complain about here. Almost like an oatmeal cookie, a chocolate raisin oatmeal cookie.   T: Reminds me of kahlua. Dark chocolate, coffee, and some booze. I'd love to say I taste some oat in there but I'm getting too much booze. Wasn't there when it was cold, but now that it has warmed up I'm getting more booze.   M: Medium body, fairly viscous. Coats the tongue well.   D: This drinks very well for an Imperial Stout. Goes down smooth and has lots of good flavors.   Not my favorite but there is nothing bad about this beer really. I bought this while I was out of state and probably would save my money or buy something else if given the chance again. Not bad but doesn't stand out to me. Good beer but not great. Rather have a Stone IRS any day.
POSITIVE	Bottled in 09  Purchased through West Lakeview Liquors, Chicago, Ill.  Price - $13.99/4-pack  It's cold as hell out there today and I needed to come home to a winter warmer and this was on the menu.  Appearance: Pours heavy with lots of body and plenty dark. A cinnamon colored head forms but quickly fades. Quite viscous like warm syrup on flap jacks. Little to no carbonation.  Smell: Aroma consists of milk chocolate, molasses, licorice and dark fruits.  Taste: A thick coating of burnt chocolate and caramel covers the tongue followed by some hop bitterness. A delicious experience.  Mouthfeel: Creamy and silky smooth. In the end finishes dry.  Drinkability: A couple of these in one night is plenty to warm the bones on a chilly night. A great representation of the style and available without camping out in line.
NEGATIVE	Poured into a tulip glass with a hazy caramel brown with a nice light tan/off white head. Aromas are pretty much all bourbon. Lots of vanilla, caramel, and candied orange peel. Very boozy, but more subdued than just straight bourbon. Almost no "traditional" beer aromas make it through. Taste is about the same. Lots of bourbon flavors: vanilla, caramel, candied orange peel. Lots of alcohol flavors. Again, almost no traditional beer flavors in this. Full-bodied, but pretty smooth mouthfeel. A little syrupy, but not cloying. Drinkable in the flavor dept., but at 10.2%, it is a definite sipper or night cap.  Great beer. Not sure I could have more than one in a night, but this is a great alternative to regular bourbon.
POSITIVE	This brew poured out as a black thick looking liquid. The head was brown in color with a light lacing. The smell of the beer was heavily roasted with some burnt wood aromas in there too. The taste of the beer was good, it was roasted and bitter with a light sweetness in there too. The mouthfeel had a good oily thickness to it which was nice. It left a good coating in the mouth too. Overall this beer is pretty good.
POSITIVE	A: Pitch black... huge tan head... infused with moderate carbonation... sticky lacing is left behind  S: Yumm... Bitter chocolate, smoke, coffee, malts and oatmeal  T: The roasted malts take on the wonderful characteristics of coffee, bitter chocolate, licorice... The flavor profile has a nice hearty earthiness too it... a dash of hops and char toward the end  M: Thick, creamy... full bodied and mildly carbonated  D: Not quite as drinkable as some of the other Imperial Stouts prove the style can be.
POSITIVE	A- Poured into a pint glass. Nice hazy golden color leaving a little head that went away quickly. Lacing around the sides of the glass from swirling of the beer.  S- Fruity hop smell (pineapple) with a very faint malty background. I only caught a whiff of it come one or two smells.  T- Crisp hop bite from the start to finish. Pineapple and citrus overtones come through very nicely as it lingers after you swallow it.  M- Little heavy the whole way through. that's not a bad thing though. Oily resin covering over the tongue which locks in the hops flavor after swallow.  D- Overall, pretty good Founder's product like usual. Since Hopslam is around 7 or 8 dollars more I would rather drink this and have a good DIPA.
NEGATIVE	500ml bottle in a straight pint glass.  Appearance: Deep copper, crystal clear with a long-lasting, mousse-y cream coloured head. Fine carbonation.  Smell: Strong toffee aroma. Slight hop nose - but only very slight.  Taste: The toffee sweetness in the aroma almost instantly gives way to a harsh bitterness on the back of the palate. Hints of toffee and almost a tobacco-like undertone. Very crisp and dry, leaves a slight coffee aftertaste.  Mouthfeel: carbonation is apparent - very spritzy on the tongue. Perhaps a little thin.  Drinkability: The dryness makes this quite quaffable.
NEGATIVE	Poured into a pint glass. This stuff pours thick...syrupy thick. No carbonation or bubbles are given off on the pour, and a half finger head only shows itself several seconds after the beer is in the glass. Retention is ok, but don't expect a lot of lacing.  The nose is fantastic. Initially, I get a huge blast of fruits, so much so I immediatly mistake it for an IPA of sorts. After a while, the sweet maple syrup comes out, and man does it smell good. Bourbon creeps in more and more as it warms. Smells great.  The taste is a let down, I'm a little disappointed to say. Way way way too hot in my opinion. There isn't enough character in the base beer (wheatwine) to match the intesity of the bourbon and alcohol. Alcohol stings the tongue, and sweet maple syrup and malts dominate.  Mouthfeel is thick and chewy, sticky even. It would be smooth if not for the sharp alcohol sting. Drinkability suffers because of the heat, but this isn't terribly hard to sip.  Overall, this is a mammoth of a beer. I definitely think this will benefit from some aging, as personally I think it's too hot now. This might be the first Founders beer that I didn't particularly care for when it is fresh, but I'm sure I'll love it farther down the line. Expect a re-review in a year or two.
NEGATIVE	12oz. bottle, chilled.  Pours a pale yellow, has a decent head that leaves a bit of lacing. Has a slightly skunky aroma, not very pleasant to me. Taste is typical pilsner, slight amount of hops, nothing special. Average level of carbonation with a light mouthfeel, high drinkability at 4.4% abv. This is a decent pilsner, but not better than a comparable domestic, reminds me of Beck's.  I'm sure if the Alstrom bros. are right then it used to be much better before the brewery was bought out by the macro companies and the formula was changed.
POSITIVE	Appearance: Light straw color and very clear. Head was about a finger high when first poured and very light and foamy. Excellent lacing.  Smell: Dried malts and sulfur.  Taste: A nice malt flavor with a little hop to balance it out. A slight hop aftertaste gives it some bitterness, but also gives it a nice crisp feel to it.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied and crisp.   Drinkability: This would be a good summer beer for those days by the pool.
POSITIVE	Appearance- thing white lacing along the the top of the surface, no carbonation to be seen, nice amber red color,  Smell- very slight malt and nice citrus and fresh hop smell, grapefruit and floral hope smell  Taste- sharp citrus hops and a long bitter finish, very nice hop flavor with a very slight twinge of malt, nicely and strongly hopped but it doesn't cross the line as to becoming to bitter, long enjoyable finish  Mouthfeel- creamy and smooth with very little carbonation, very nice feel  Drinkability- Highly drinkable thats for darn sure, I find this to be an excellent example of what i expect from an IPA, the finish is fantastic and the balance is very much what I enjoy, walks that fine line of what I look for as being strongly hopped but with still a balance to leave me wanting more then one, definitely a beer I will have many more times and recommend as a great example of the style
POSITIVE	I've wanted to try this beer for years. Kudos to my wife for buying me several bottles. The beer is an utterly black liquid with a chocolate-milk colored head. Thick, viscous, and dense. Wow, what an aroma. Coffee, oatmeal, roasted grains, hops, barley, booze, and wet earth. Nice, very nice. The taste is similarly intense. Full and rich, with a notable warming. It's bitter and dry, with a slightly slick oat note. Full and heafty mouthfeel. This is a seriously good stout.
NEGATIVE	A - this wee heavy pours a dark amber/brown color with a finger thick of caramel colored head, too hazy to note any carbonation  S - mmm, i love the smell of a good wee heavy, that great sweet smell of dark fruits like dates or raisins with that darker molasses/brown sugar sweetness mixed in, there also seems to be a vanilla hint was well, all atop the subtle hops that are not carelessly drowned out  T - the taste is far more balance than the aroma, the hop bitterness and the amalgamation of sweets are artfully interwoven, both characteristics persist throughout the taste and to the aftertaste  M - the sweetness lends this beer to a smooth mouthfeel with no intrusive sharpness or offensive traits  D - all this rsults in a high drinkability, a great wee heavy, Founder's got it right, only the above average ABV holds it back
POSITIVE	Hazy light copper hue. Head recedes into a one fingered, pitted cream white layer. Loose lace remains. Assertive wafts of pink grapefruit flesh and smashed pine needle upfront in aroma. Secondary are notes of peach like esters and light toffee. Robust, clean and inviting aromawise. Incipient in flavor is cuspate hop bitterness, which lends a transient, puckering dryness. Sweetness ensues promptly, in a combination of sugary caramel and slightly underripe tangerine. As the beer warms, gentle butterscotch hints bolster the caramel malt backbone. Moderate in body for style, with a dangerously fliud and brisk mouthfeel. Finishes with an apricot skin and hopped vanilla sugar cookie notes lingering agreeably. Satiating alcohol warmth surfaces after a deliberation. An excellent DIPA overall with superb drinkabilty. A quintessential example of the style with its citrus driven flavor profile and sturdy, yet dryish malt backbone. Top notch, and an instant DIPA favorite of mine.
POSITIVE	Paid $1.70 for a single at Ludlow Wines in Clifton...  The beer pours a clear golden base, decent sized head, good retention and no lacing on the glass. The aroma is banana heavy with other notes of wheat and clove/cardamom.  The taste is refreshing during the summer-time, low carbonation, very crisp with little aftertaste; tastes just like it smells. Excellent feeling in the mouth and yes, session, a great session beer!  Final Thought: Solid offering as usual from Stoudt's, but I was hoping they would try an mimic a Bavarian hefeweizen over this unique brew... oh well, it works!
POSITIVE	A - Near white head, 1 inch goes to disk fast. Lots of cling lace. Murky golden color.  S - Brine, malt and a touch of bitter.  T - Beautiful mix of deep sweet malt, booze and killer hops. Yum.  M - Medium to full body, lots of carb, big feel in the mouth, finishes surprisingly clean.  D - I could see myself drinking this one till it hurt.
POSITIVE	Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a tulip. Coppery golden in color. Medium, off white head. Moderate retention. Clear, oily lacing sticks to the glass. Aroma dominated by earthy hops and malt sweetness. Honestly the aroma has a bit of an "aged" smell to it. People into aging beer (like myself) know this familiar aroma. Sharing this one with cheesemoose and we both agree, this one isn't fresh. (purchased this week at Total Wine in Charlotte). Still tasty, just not what i expected. Wish it had a bottled on date. We just cant find one.
NEGATIVE	On tap in a shaker pint. Near black with mahogany highlights. A bit of head, a bit of lace.   Massively sweet and boozy nose, a concoction that's obviously malty but with some odd adjunct qualities. Holy mackerel, this stuff is sweet, a wave of malted milk and lemon-lime soda. Burnt and harsh woody flavors are in direct contrast rather than providing any sort of balance. Medium-thick with a lowish carbonation that does little to keep things moving along. By far the worst beer I've had from what is normally an enjoyable brewery.
POSITIVE	Beautiful color that can be best described as burnt amber. The body was clear and was topped with a foamy tan head. The head thinned out, but never quite died. The aroma is that of an intensely smoky grill sprinkled with sugar. The sweet and acrid smell hit me at an arms length and nearly put me into a higher orbit with its intensity every time the glass touched my lips. The taste was just as good as the smell with a caramelized sweet maltyness and a smoky bitterness. There were some mildly grassy hop presence, but that was only a secondary pleasure. The mouthfeel was full and satisfying, and the smoky aftertaste lingered on forever. Very good and intricate beer that is the best of the Rauchbier offerings in my opinion.
POSITIVE	Pours out really black, with a little off-white head. The aroma is very sweet, of things like molasses, brown sugar, and caramel, along with a slight hint of coffee. Not so much of the dark roasted notes that I might have expected. Can't quite detect the alcohol, although there's a bourbon note there too. Upon tasting I notice the bourbon, some fermented fruit, and it leaves a slightly smoky aftertaste, and not much in the way of hops. Overall, it could have more punch to it. I wouldn't have guessed that this was a double stout. In the mouth it's fine, but a little thin if anything. All that said, it went down well, maybe too easily for a stout.and it was enjoyable. There are definitely better stouts out there, but this was alright.
POSITIVE	12 oz bottle purchased as a single at the Vintage Cellar in Blacksburg, Va. Appearance: Pours a clear and radiant orange amber body with a one finger, ecru tinted head. Excellent retention and an exceptional patch lacing effect. Aroma: Profound aromas of fruits, hops, and malts greet the nose. Quite a melange here, with fresh orange pulp, red apple skins, grapefruit, and pine sap, mingling with malty caramel and some saffron. Very nice array of tropical fruits also includes papaya and pineapple. Mouthfeel: Medium bodied, with restrained carbonation, some oily hop resin, and some vanilla creaminess. Taste: Fruity hops are dominant, with lots of grapefruit and orangepeel bitterness. Excellent balance is provided by a sweetbread maltiness. Accents of saffron, cotton candy, and vanilla add a surprising complexity. Lots of tasty flavors here, but the finish has an ideal grapefruit and pine resin bitterness. Drinkability: Wow! This one is a beauty. How do they conceal the 10% abv so well? Tasty and well balanced, dangerously drinkable. One of the best Double IPAs around.
POSITIVE	Appears a deep, dark brown, nearing an opaque black. Crimson and copper highlights show when held to the light. The off-white cap slowly fades away and leaves streaks of webbing around the glass. Smell is of ripe, dark fruit, cocoa, mocha, espresso, green, citrusy hops, and a touch of anise. Taste is of the mentioned aromas with the standout cocoa and mocha java flavors coming to the forefront. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, lightly carbonated, and really smooth in the finish.
NEGATIVE	Well this is not my favorite style of beer for sure but wanted to give this one a try,pours a deep amber with pretty light head.Huge smokey aroma like being next to a bonfire almost,taste is deeply smoked like smoked ham or sausage the beer has decent dry ending.Smokey and slightly sweet harsh on the taste buds for awhile I am sure a classic example but not my thing.Gave it a good rating however knowing this one is about as good as it gets for the style.
POSITIVE	Poured out as a nice deep brown color with a yellow white head on top. The lacing and retention are pretty good. The smell of the beer is very malty with a slightly sweet aroma. The taste of the beer had an earthy flavor to it with lots of malt in there. The mouthfeel has a good thickness to it. Overall I think this beer is very good and worth trying.
POSITIVE	Pours a murky brown color with a tan head. Head falls to nothing. Not much lace.   Aroma is of candied malts and mild alcohol. Some fruit notes. Does smell a bit like a Double.   Starts off with the sweetness of the malts quickly followed by a mild alcohol taste. Ends with a hop flavor that lingers on.   Smooth mouthful quickly gives way to a sharp bite. Mildly carbonated.   Fairly easy drinking and s nice attempt at the style. Worth trying.
POSITIVE	26 oz bottle.  This is a copper colored beer with amber highlights. It pours with a tan head that displays good retention. The aroma is very hoppy, with strong floral notes. The taste is balanced with malt and hops. The malt displays just a touch of sweetness, while the hops kick in a decent bitterness in the finish. This is a traditional English-style IPA, and as such does not exhibit the over-the-top hop levels of the American IPA. The mouthfeel is solid, and the drinkability is very good.
POSITIVE	Pours a dark orange/gold color with a light off-white head that fades away fairly quickly while leaving good bits of lacing .  Aroma is very citric with a lot of lemon upfront, but also gives way to a sweet malty tone in the back.  Taste starts off with a nice balance of caramel malt and citric hops. Lemon is most prominent with grapefruit present to a lesser degree. Immediately in to each sip, the caramel and bready malt comes in. Not as hoppy as I normally like for my IPAs, but the balance was pulled off so well that I found it to be quite enjoyable all the same.  Medium body and medium carbonation. Again, not what I normally look form in an IPA, perhaps a little too malty for my preferred taste, but a more balanced IPA is good to have every now and then. I would drink this again in an instant, just not if I was having an intense hop craving.
NEGATIVE	12oz bottle, cellared about 16 months.  A: In my snifter, this beer is black with a thin, ecru head with rather poor retention. Reddish highlights  S: This really smells like an oatmeal cookie. What a treat! There's some milk chocolate and a mild bitterness, but the oatmeal character is unique. Faint oxidation is present, slightly cardboard-like, but to my nose, it works well with the strong oatmeal aroma.   T: Opens with a lot of oatmeal flavor with a strong, balancing bitterness. Again, there's a slight cardboard-like flavor, this time I'm not too crazy about it. Bitter chocolate is strong, and dominates on the finish that's strangely watery  M: While slick on the palate, the carbonation is a bit high and detracts from the experience. The body, while present with heft, is surprisingly watery. The finish is bitter and robust, pleasantly so.  D: I was hoping I'd like this more, but I guess I'll stick to lagers from Stoudts, all of which have been excellent
POSITIVE	A: Poured into a pint glass, it appears oil-like as it glug-glugs into the glass: thick and black. A thin wisp of brown head appears on top of an opaque black body. That film of a head disappears quickly, however, likely a victim of the 8.3% ABV. No lace left behind.  S: First impression, not surprisingly, is of the coffee. Roasted coffee beans and just plain coffee. As it warms I get more of a chocolatey smell, but coffee is the dominant scent throughout.  T: Roasted, even slightly burnt, coffee. Husky roasted cereal grains. As I drink it more, the roasted acidity subsides and I begin to get more chocolate -- both dark chocolate, with the commensurate bitterness, and milk chocolate, with its sweetness. The chocolate becomes more pronounced as it warms, though the coffee and roasted barley-like bitterness never entirely subsides. Bitterness on the finish and lingering afterwards. ABV not even in the picture.  M: Definitely full-bodied. Chewy, creamy and smooth all at once, if that's possible.  D: 5.0 all of the way.
POSITIVE	poured cold from the tap at yogi's a semi opaque deep amber brown to a standard pint with a hint of a head that's gone before it hits my coaster. spotty ring of lace after each sip.  extremely subtle sweet malty aroma. brown sugars.  brown sugars, molasses, hints of scotch whiskey, dried cherries, raisins.  big bodied, medium carbonation, sweet with no bitter presence.  drinkable - yep, but it's sneaky.  overall - great example of style - 2nd only to NEBCO wet willy.
NEGATIVE	Poured from a 1 pint 9oz bottle (with no freshness date) into a standard pint glass.  A=This beer is very nice to look at. It poured copperish to reddish amber. It poured an off white head with slightly brown hues to it. It was huge and very lumpy with great retention. Lots of sticky lacing was left on the side of the glass.  S=Rather unremarkable. I picked up a little malty sweetness, but not much else.  T=The taste redeemed the araoma some. It tastes of buttery sweet malt and caramel, almost like sweet bread. There is a slight hop bite to the finish and a spicey alcohol to warm the palate as well. I also, noticed some metallic notes in this one as well. However, it did leave a bit of a skunky-bitter aftertaste. I am not sure if this is due to the beer being past its prime as there was no freshness date. I must say that I was disappointed with the hops in this one. The volume was turned way down in regards to the Holy Hops.  M=Moderate character with the right amount of carbonation.  D=Not bad. Not great either. I hope this one comes through a little better on the next bottle. Perhaps, I was expecting too much.
POSITIVE	Shared with walows, from his cellar. Thanks beer geek girlfriend! You are the best.  It's a perfectly delicious Oatmeal Imperial Stout, and totally sexy pouring out of the bottle. Smells good, tastes good. It's thick, viscous, and luscious. But the best part: I love the way it slinks across my tongue.
POSITIVE	A 2009 bottle poured into a sam adams perfect pint glass.  Appearance: Pours a cloudy, dark reddish amber with a small layer of off white head. Some lacing.  Smell: Sweet malt, dark fruit, vanilla, some warm alcohol and bourbon.  Taste: Sweet malt with some caramel and vanilla. Incredibly smooth bourbon with some brown sugar and a slight alcohol burn in the finish.  Mouthfeel: Medium body with smooth carbonation and a dry finish.  Overall: The age has done this one very well. Extremely smooth and complex. I'll definitely have this one again.
POSITIVE	Had this on tap at a special tasting.  A- Pours a deep black color with a thin mocha head that leaves some mild lacing.  S- Huge aroma of roasted malt and bourbon. Vanilla bean and oak scents blast through and can be smelled even across the room!  T- Big rush of bourbon initially which mellows into a combination of vanilla, oak, and bittersweet chocolate flavors. Roasted malt and coffee in the finish. The bourbon and alcohol are both apparent but not bothersome.   M- Big and full bodied. Low carbonation with a lingering roasted/vanilla bourbon aftertaste.  D- Overall a huge brew with a nice bourbon flavor that wasn't over done.
POSITIVE	12 oz twist off bottle  A- pours a ruby brown color with nice vibrant red highlights. A decent white head forms and leaves a bit of sticky lace. No visible carbonation...is this the trend with Founders?  S- Fresh hops, sweet toasty malts, hints of cherry and apple and a nice rye spicyness about it.  T- Very fruity, malty/grainy/rye character at first, ripe fruit notes, good hop bitterness, citrus notes and sweet floral feel. A chocolatey aftertaste mixed with some hop bitterness upon the finish. Awesome.  M/D- Medium body, good over all complexity and a great amount of carbonation makes for another delicious, easy drinking session beer from Founders.
POSITIVE	A solid IPA with nicely assertive citrus hops notes that mellow into a moderate bittering as the beer progresses. The higher abv is well integrated in the flavor profile and a bit deceptive - lulling you into thinking several of these in a session would be a good idea.
POSITIVE	500ml bottle 8.3% ABV  A- Pours a nice dark walnut brown with a soft beige-y head. Head dissipates quickly leaving little lacing.  S- Initial sharp tang of dark fruit tang with a medicinal-malt follow-up. Not the most pleasing smelling beer.  T- Not the beer I expected after smelling it... Extroidinariry complex but balanced. Initial flavors of chocolate and caramel with notes of vanilla, burn sugar and toast. Sweet malt, with subtle piney-hop finish.  M- Smooth, medium body. Alcohol in the finish that's not overwhelming despite 8.3% ABV- leaves a warming feeling going down.  D- A nice fire-side warmer. 500ml bottle that can be split or consumed solo.
POSITIVE	Pitch black, with a mocha colored, two-finger head. The head is short lived but leaves some decent lace.  The aroma is sweet and roasty. Smoky, with cocoa, roasted malt and dark chocolate. It smells delicious.   The beer is a bit lighter than I expected, but it still has a good medium body and a slightly creamy texture. The flavors are smoke, roasted and burnt malt, coffee. It then transitions to lots of dark roasted malts with a sweet cream character. The finish introduces some bitter flavors from the hops and the aftertaste is like a heavily creamed, dark-roast coffee. A really good stout.
NEGATIVE	Simple gold with large bubbles clinging to the glass and miniscule ones racing up to the pure white cap. If this beer uses O'Fallon Unfiltered Wheat as a base beer, then why is it perfectly clear? (note: the beer does become mildly cloudy when the final ounce is added to the glass). The semi-creamy head is a bit watery and leaves evanescent lace as a result.  If the nose is any indication, the brewery added more than the 'touch of peach' that they claim. On the positive side of the ledger, the peachiness smells natural, like the fresh fruit. In addition, it doesn't overpower the underlying wheatiness of the ale. There is no real negative side. Even as one who isn't thrilled with peaches, this is a wonderful peach beer nose.  Unfiltered Wheat is supremely uninteresting beer and does nothing to distinguish itself from the legions of bland APWAs being brewed across America. Wheach is here to provide a much needed kick in the ass. As in the nose, the peachy flavor has been added in just the right amount; it's neither too subtle nor too aggressive.  The problem is, though, the beer tastes harsh for some reason. I expected soft, wheaty and fruity. I'm getting ragged, bitter and peach pitty. Something other than the simple addition of 'natural (peach) flavor' had to have been added to get from Unfiltered Wheat to Wheach. My natural dislike of peach isn't an issue here because I've given several peach beers good scores.   The body is acceptable and actually hits most of its marks given the base beer and the style. It's closer to light than to medium, holds up well with warming (which is more than I can say for the flavor) and is acceptably carbonated.  Wheach (an infinitely superior name to Pheat) was a nice idea that didn't come off as well as it might have. I'm all for jazzing up a lackluster American Pale Wheat Ale, even if peach is the flavor chosen, but I can't help feeling that something went wrong with this particular beer. Smoke is still the star of the O' Fallon Brewery.
POSITIVE	Swore off all drugs and alcohol with this one on 5/14/2005. 16-oz. pint at the source.  1/8-inch crust devolves quickly to a Petri dish growth of covering with some fits and starts of stick and lace. Cant say much about the hue other than black, pitch black. Caramel sweet and chocolate malt hits the nose straight on, followed by a nutty roasted character and a slight, lactic chocolate note. Malted chocolate on mouth, but cleared out by the roasted malt and flaky oat. Toffee and chocolate flavors stick on the mouth pleasantly, and overall a medium-bodied offering.  Solid, rock solid pour. The Beantowne Espresso uses this as a base, with the coffee added to it.
POSITIVE	God, Kilt Lifter is an overused name.   But, hey, this is a pretty good American Scotch.   Peaty, round toffee, with a very amber malt--big nodes of brown sugar and caramel and the finish is more sour than sweet or bitter. It's much earthier than your typical American Scotch, but this makes it much more drinkable.   It packs a punch but it isn't zippy or burny. Some people might be put off by this, but I'm not convinced that a strong alcohol presence is a necessary component of a Scotch.
NEGATIVE	Poured from a bomber into a shaker pint glass.  A: Clear, light reddish-amber color with one finger of lofty off-white foam head. Moderate lacing remains on the glass.  S: A faint combination of floral and piney hops that also feature some toast and mixed fruit.  T: Begins off-dry, with malt-focused flavors of toasted bread and caramel that increase in sweetness. Hop aromatics are floral but muted. Astringency emerges in the middle as acidity peaks at a moderate level. The finish possesses diminishing qualities encountered earlier, mainly floral hops and esters, with moderate bitterness.  M: Medium viscosity, slightly sticky on the palate, with moderate carbonation.  D: If a brewery that cans most of their product puts a beer in a bottle, does that mean it's special? In this case, the answer is no. It is a very malt-focused IPA that features an underwhelming smell and some rough flavor edges. Ultimately Caldera's standard IPA wins out, with this beer as a hybrid IPA/DIPA that just lacks characteristic abv and hop intensity. This mis-step does little to shake my confidence in Caldera, considering the mastery shown in other beers such as the barrel-aged Mogli or their rauch bock. I do have to question the source of their interest in this particular recipe.
POSITIVE	Pours a nice orangey-brown color with just a tiny bit of quick receding, white head.   Spices are ridiculously pungent. Get a lot of cinnamon, cloves and ginger and not much else.  Taste starts of sort of bready and ends with a cornucopia of the spices in the nose. A tad sweet but not all that sweet and no hops to be found.  nice carbonation, fairly light and refreshing.  Very good pumpkin ale. On the pricey side but so is every beer in DC :)
POSITIVE	Thanks to Bryan from Louisville.  A- Pours an orange/red that has just the slightest haze to it. A small head, about a half finger, recedes rather quickly and leaves just a small cap on the beer.  S- Big sweet malt greets the nose right away. A little bit of roastiness in there as well. Some hops meld well in there too.  T- Sweet caramel and malt on the forefront. After the initial burst of flavor that roastiness comes into play and just the slightest bit of hops. Just a touch of honey at the end  M- Medium bodied but it is a touch on the thin side. Good carbonation and a nice smoothness on the end of the beer.   D- A good refreshing beer that has good flavors. Nothing too overpowering makes this a good summer time beer. I have a few more offerings from BBC so I am looking forward to what they have to offer.
NEGATIVE	Thanx to nopucophop for sending one of these my way  A: poured a black like motor oil with absolutely no head present and honestly no lacing either sticking to the glass.  S: yup.... there is plenty of bourbon to go around with brown sugar, oak notes, slight, spice and toffee notes. I did get a little chocolate and roastiness but for the most part the bourbon dominated the nose.  T: like the nose the bourbon takes over the palate but does give a little room for the brown sugar, oak, vanilla, and chocolate, to take a peak. it also seemed to have coffee on the tail end of a sip but had cocoa coming through as well and slight hop character as well.  M: the brew was full body with a very low amount of carbonation which was sweet, silky, slight chewy, bitter, and boozy finish.  D: it drank pretty damn good considering the ABV on the beer and was really living up to all the hype. I have to say that it is a beefed up regular breakfast stout and is a brew you definitely have to share with friends.
NEGATIVE	Pours a murky brown with a towering white head. I do detect strong banana, clove, and yeast in the nose combining with a nice sweet and slightly toasted chocolate malt presence. A touch acidic when I taste it...very light. There is a touch of chocolate and caramel malts coming through. Any other flavors seem to be so subtle that the acidity makes them indiscernible. Rather bland...disappointing after the towering eye candy of a head that for a moment was remniscent of the guinness cascade. Not terrible, just bland enough to be a let down.
NEGATIVE	Had this beer on-tap in a small canteen in central Prague a month ago. It was so cheap I couldn't believe my eyes when paying for this pint--just 12KC or 20 pence (Sterling Pounds)!!  It pours a rocky and foamy white beerhead, settling rather fast to a thin layer of medium bubbles... golden/light honeyish colour; medium-rich carbonation. The nose is very softly malty with light, lime-like fruity hops and soda-biscuit and dough's softly sour note. On the palate, again a lot of soft malts arrive in full force, with a light, delicate hop flavour at the back--no particular bitterness detected in the finish, while chewy, bready flavour is more noticeable towards the very end. It's basically a thin-bodied, mild-flavoured pilsner, with a bit of watery mouthfeel in the end. Straight-forward and much more boring than Pilsner Urquell, albeit very thirst quenching especially when served on tap.
POSITIVE	Appearance: clear reddish amber / orange color with a two inch creamy head that lasts nicely. Light lacing develops during the session.  Smell: bread, ripe red fruits, and a bit of yeast.  Taste: bread, overripe black plums, caramel, yeast, and a mild bitterness. A simple dry hearty beer here.  Mouthfeel: smooth and dry throughout. Hint of crispness at the end. Bread and caramel linger softly on the tongue after swallowing. Medium bodied.  Drinkability: very good. Personally a definite session beer for me, one of the better brews from Cooperstown.
NEGATIVE	12oz bottle with a Bottled On Date of 05/10/11. Pours a dark brownish ruby color with a half inch of head. Zero lacing. Smells sweet with some malt, booze, raisin and berry aromas. Taste is a sllightly boozey, malty sweetness. A hint of smoke. Somewhat medicinal at the end but its not too bad. Its a decent Wee Heavy but the medicine taste is now starting to get to me more. Still a good beer. Overall, I'd buy it again but a 6 pack would take me a while to finish.
POSITIVE	a: This was a clear pale golden color. It was served to me with a medium sized white fluffy head, with decent lacing.  s: Smells of muted piney hops with hints of lemon and pepper. The alcohol was noticeable but not obtrusive. The malts lent a candied sugar aroma.  t: I was surprised by how much I liked this. It wasn't as hoppy as I expected, they tasted mostly of pine with some nice citrus undertones. The malts had a caramel, grainy taste to the them. The alcohol might have come on a bit too strong, but I welcomed it on a cold rainy day.  m: I couldn't believe how thick this was! It almost had the body of barleywine, very thick and silky. The carbonation was spot-on as well.  d: This was a pretty good one-off beer from Stoudt's but I think I'll stick to the regular lineup next time.
POSITIVE	This is a review of the 2011 batch, I have drank this since 2008.  A- Every year the appearance is the same to me, very black with minimal carbonation.  S- that coffee is the most pronounce smell of this beer to me.  T- Nice and roasty, I have had this since 2008 and I feel 2011 is lacking that nice mellow bourbon burn.  M- This beer always has a great mouthfeel, thick, creamy and all you can ask for in a top notch RIS.  This beer does deserve a lot of hype it gets but if I were you stay away from the 2011 vintage, I feel it is lacking.
POSITIVE	A-Dark brown with a medium light tan head. Left decent lacing.  S-Light roastines and a bit of chocolate. A faint whiff of hops filters through.  T-Roasty malt and chocolate flavours blend nicely and then fade into a bit of bittersweetness. A light hop tingle at the end.  M-Medium body with a slightly dry, silky smooth finish.   D-With what Utah brewers have to work with, nothing more than 3.2% ABW, I cannot complain about this beer. Nice roasty flavour and an easy drinkibility. As their slogan states...Why have just one?
NEGATIVE	At the expo.  Poured cloudy and hazy light golden with hardly any head. Hmm, this is different for a wheat I guess. At least the banana is pretty prominent though! Lighter notes of clove and bubblegum, but mostly banana and wheat twang. A solid hefe with a smooth and crisp mouthfeel. Nothing that offends the palate here. Will revisit.
POSITIVE	Pours a nice ruby color with an off white head. Leaves some nice lacing.  A nice sweet hoppy smell, not what I expected.  I would never guess this is a doppelbock. Doesn't taste like one at all, but in a really good way. Very hoppy throughout with a nice malt backbone that comes through especially in the after taste. Very tasty, I'm going to hunt down a case of this stuff if I can.  Good mouthfeel, less body than you would expect from a doppelbock, but at this point I should not even be thinking of this as a doppelbock.  Great drinkability.
POSITIVE	Stopped in to get a growler of this but it was about to kick so they were only doing pours of it, unfortunately.  A - Black beer, bit of tan head that stuck around for a bit and left some nice spots for a big stout. Pretty nice looking.  S - Lots of chocolate, coconut, bourbon, vanilla, barrel. Nice roast and dark fruit, really has a lot going on. I feel like the comes through a little too strong and needs some tme to settle down.  T - Taste is really good, lots of chocolate, coconut, dark fruits, roast. It's pretty sweet, pushes the limits of being too sweet, but it's good. Beer drinks a little hot and boozy, needs time to cool, my biggest complaint about it. Still, very nice complexity and flavor.  M - Full bodied, lower carbonation, almost chewey.  O - Really nice beer, if this is the beginning of their barrel aging I'd say Haymarket has a ton of potential to kick out some really great big beers. Would love to drink this again, particularly after it's had a bit of time to sit.
NEGATIVE	bottle from a bottle shop in auckland. pours a nice black darkness with a bit of head and some decent lacing... Nose has a lot of smoke on it, and an odd vegetable smell. Hops are subdued, which may be the odd vegetable smell, more along the lines of a pea smell... Taste is not so good, i am looking for a date on this bottle, and it is one of the few i have seen that does not have a best by date... seems old. Hops are not really there, though they dont really taste stale either.... just seems like they are missing. possibly some english style hops in there, but the American Black Ale is wrong. A bit of coal, and some smoke on the palate as well, but the main thing this is supposed to have, it is completely lacking.  mouthfeel is medium, well carbed, nice on all fronts but where it needs to be. Big failure, in my opinion.
POSITIVE	Poured from the bottle a dark rosey amber with a thin white head that dissapated quickly. Smell was dominated by hops pine and floral with a small amount of citrus in the nose. Taste is floral orange and lemon up front with a small amount of malt in the middle with a dry finish of pine and cut grass hops. Mouthfeel was a little on the thin side for a double but habd decent carbonation and body. Drinkability was nice very clean and crisp IPA. Would have another but not my favorite of this style.
POSITIVE	Little smell thick tan head head fades quick lacing Coffee,  chocolate  Coffee and chocolate bitterness Light alcohol aftertaste Odd oatmeal aftertaste (same as Ten Fiddy) Goes down easy You can sip if you like or drink normally (depends on your mood) Smooth effervescence Very little smell...faint alcohol, oatmealiness and chocolate malts  This is a hugely enjoyable beer for me, but in small amounts. Not much of a noes which is concerning.  EDIT: I know that "odd" taste now (after reading some other reviews) - liquorish. I say odd because I'm not terribly fond of liquorish (I hate it on it's own), but I know w/o it the entire flavor profile would change. So although I say odd, I'll have it no other way.
POSITIVE	On draft at Barley's in Asheville. Black pour, smallish tan head. Very roasty aromas, heavy malt and espresso. Good coffee and chocolate flavors, licorice and roast malt as well. Very solid medium body. Drinkable stout. Straight forward, not the most complex, but not bad.
NEGATIVE	Bottle sample thanks to Milos. Very dark amber with a thick beige cap. Sulphury nose leads to burnt sugar, caramel, figs, alcohol. Very sweet, reminds of caramel malts with pit fruits, very little bitterness. Full bodied, oily, syrupy and creamy. Seems way heftier than it is in terms of ABV. Interesting to try. Thanks Milos!
POSITIVE	22oz bottle poured into a tulip glass  A: Pours hazy dark red-orange with just over a finger of fairly tight white head. Good retention, leaves decent lacing.  S: Pine, candied fruit, caramel. Very sweet smelling, this one could be fading.  T: Hops are definitely on the down swing. Upfront I get pine, slightly dank orange and herbs, a little grapefruit, and floral notes. Not too bitter or sharp. There definitely is a good bit of caramel sweetness, but it isn't so much so that it's offensive. Fairly wet finish with a little bit of lingering bitterness.   M: Medium body, moderate carbonation that fizzes out quickly and leaves a smooth and nearly effervescent-free finish. Fairly resinous and an adequate level of bitterness.  O: This actually isn't too bad for a now fading IPA. I could see this being pretty solid when fresh, maybe even great. At this point now it doesn't seem that old (maybe 2 months to 3 months) and is certainly enjoyable.
NEGATIVE	Poured a slightly chunky, dark auburn color with a medium sized, light orange/tan head.  Smells like dark fruits, caramel, and a slight alocoholic aroma.  Taste is sickly sweet with a malty syrup, raisins, piney hops, and a slightly burnt caramel sweetness. Warm alcoholic burn similar from quads.  Well carbonated, quite thick and a bit syrupy.  Drinkability is slightly hampered from the syrup thickness and alcohol content, but nothing quad lovers couldn't easily handle.
POSITIVE	A: Jet black colored with a small mocha head that will rise upon swirling in my snifter.  S: Nice roasted bittersweet chocolate slightly boozy but not too overwhelming.  T: Very nice dark chocolate with a bit of molasses underneath.  M: Thick and creamy. I wouldn't say overly thick but it definitely feels nice as coats your tongue.  D: Pretty good for a nice sized stout. Very nice flavors and and pleasant to drink will be bringing me back to this one quite often!
POSITIVE	Pours straw yellowwith a large foamy head that stays around and leaves plenty of lacing on the glass.  The smell is clean - floral and honeyish.  The taste is of a crisp bitterness balanced by a honeyish sweetness. Slight grassiness. Nice balance in a medium body. Sweet, fairly dry finish. Fairly creamy and smooth.  This is a nice, easy drinking "sessionable" lager. Tasty, clean, crisp and refreshing.
POSITIVE	Wow!! Breakfast in a bottle. In fact, I made it a point to try these ( as a four pk., one at a time.) in the morning as a breakfast beer. The beer pours a black as black can get with a small for a stout head. It dose cascade quickly, so its a short show and she's ready to go. Lace is alittle thin and wispy.   The aroma is of expresso like coffee bean and oatmeal. The taste carries the oatmeal in the taste as well as the coffee, bakers chocolate and alcohol.  The beer is very drinkable, thick, and chewy but not intrusive. The mouthfeel is smooth, sweet but with a burnt dryness left behind.  Overall breakfast in a bottle? You Bet!!
POSITIVE	I am not sure if I had this on tap or cask. I am assuming since I had it at the keller it was on cask. The body is light amber brown with a red hue. It had a creamy head with good follow through lace. The aroma is a deep smoke and wood scent. The flavor was like eating meat and drinking a beer it the same time with some subtle hop tones. It was light bodied and went down easy.
POSITIVE	Enjoyed this beer from the comfort of my living room watching Saint Ralph. From bottle to pint glass.  Appearance: Served a reddish light brown with a pink head.  Smell: Very raspberry.  Taste: Pretty tart and pretty good.  Mouthfeel: Smooth and easy.  Drinkability: Pretty good fruit beer.
POSITIVE	12 oz bottle purchased as part of a case from Green's in Columbia by a friend of mine. Thanks again Dan! Poured into a standard pint glass.  A: Pours a jet black with no hints of any colors even when held up to the light. The head was extremely short lived but was a beautiful chocolate color when it was there. The ring of bubbles that does remain leaves a bit of lacing on the glass.  S: Vanilla, oak, bourbon, coffee, and dark roasted malts all join together to make a wonderful complex and inviting aroma.  T: I hate to do it a bit of an injustice by saying see the smell category and change aroma to taste, but it is perfect for this one. What an incredible tasty and complex brew. The vanilla and bourbon make it a real special treat to me.  M: It is a bit thinner than I would expect for the style. The oak also makes it a bit harsh in the mouth for me even though I like the flavor it gives it causes the mouthfeel to suffer a bit.  D: The ABV is well hidden, but you still naturally want to sip this one to savor it. With that said, it does drink easier than quite a few of its style competitors.  This is a great brew and worth all the accolades and posts it gets. Once again a big thanks to Dan for getting a case for myself and a friend to share. I have traded quite a bit of it away for some other gems to various local buddies. I am pretty sure I am going to keep the rest of it for myself.
POSITIVE	Into a tulip, pours a lovely copper amber with a quarter inch off-white head, nice lacing in dots, arches and spiderwebs. The aroma was a bit perplexing to me, for some reason full and boisterous one whiff, dull and receding the next. That said, plenty of woody port wine, some brandy, some dark fruits, some other stuff that my dysfunctional nose is having a hard time distinguishing.   Taste is full and malty, some nice alcohol warming drifts through. Some caramels mix with resinous hops, honey oozing around, rum soaked dark fruits through the finish. Mouth is full, warm, a bit slick with nice, fine carbonation. In all, quite a tasty beer, rather enjoyed it.
POSITIVE	I had a 12 oz. bottle of 2010 KBS at Armesby Abbey in Worcester last night. This was my first time with KBS, but I've been a huge fan of Breakfast Stout for years. Poured by the bartender into a Founder's Tulip.  Appearance: Rich, deeply khaki tan head on top of a slick looking black body. This one looks rick and deep. Hardly a shred of light can cut through this guy.  Aroma: I get a very boozy, dark chocolate whiff right off the bat. Warms the nostrils. Not so much coffee flavor here, but a nice host of roasted malts are in the scent too.  Taste: This is a very unified, complex tasting beer. I think the alcohol melts all the flavors together. There is indeed a lot of dark chocolate bitterness that get complemented well by dark fruit and roasted malts.  Mouthfeel/Drinkability: This may be the slickest feeling beer I've ever had. It is chewy and warm, but hardly what you'd call viscous. There is a strong lingering taste to this beer, but it mostly comes in the form of a boozy heat, not cloying body. One of these will do you just fine. Probably no need to drink for than one of these in a night. Just too rich, boozy, and nuanced to have more than one.  Overall: I really loved this beer. I'm glad I've had it now so I can compare it to regular FBS. This one definitely cuts down on the coffee presence, but the boozy heat adds a different dimension to the overall flavor profile.  33 Beers Flavor Chart (5 high to 1 low): Alcoholic/Solvent: 4.5 Dark Fruit: 4 Citrus Fruit: 1 Hoppy (pine): 3 Floral: 2 Spicy: 3 Herbal: 3 Malty: 5 Toffee: 4 Burnt: 3 Sweet: 3 Sour: 1 Bitter: 3.5 Astringent: 1 Body: 4 Linger: 4
POSITIVE	You can almost hear the creaminess of this beer as it pours into your glass. The slightly dark one inch head bravely mimics the dark copper hue, and the large hexagonal bubbles lingering in the bottle are a sight to behold. This beer looks very appetizing.  One smell of this rauchbier and youll understand why they call it that. The smell of smoked meats immediately brought me back to the corner Metzgerei in Germany.  My nose has not let me down. The sweet aroma of smoked meats easily translates into welcome flavours, with a perfect balance of malt and hops. A very well-rounded taste.  Contrary to what you would expect from the taste, the beer is slightly dry and light bodied with a nice level of carbonation.  Overall this is a wonderful beer on every level. The look, smell and taste all come together to make you feel right at home in Bavaria - even when youre thousands of miles away.
POSITIVE	Fluffy inch-thick head, excited bubbles moving swiftly up the liquid, copper-sunset gold, big and wavy lace strips...all the makings of a great IPA, looks-wise.   Aroma doesn't favor either hops or malt, but provides an equal balance of both. Kind of fruity, kind of candy-like. Grassy hops ride underneath the malt sweetness. Clean and quality aroma.  Big gooey malts hit first, with a controlled sugar sweetness, then those hops lay down long and wide on the tongue, and stay throughout the finish. They're piney, and certainly a huge part of the flavor, but they're balanced absolutely perfectly by the chewy caramel-like malt. Reminds me of many a Northwest IPA.   The big flavor is only helped by a gooey, creamy texture. Just enough carbonation prickles the tongue, but the slicker, mellower, rounder characteristics rule over anything else, making the whole experience even better for it.  Holy crap, this is an excellent IPA. There aren't many others that perform better...you can't go wrong here. Founders comes up with another mighty ale.
NEGATIVE	Found at Eagle Provisions, NYC. Very decent for its style, it has a decent dark appearance and malty aroma. Quite drinkable, nicely malted not sweet, balanced with some moderate bitterness. A bit of smoke in taste and average mouthfeel, I taste caramel. .
POSITIVE	Appearance - Pours a dark copper color with a small head that vanishes quickly.  Smell - Almost smells like wine.. Some type of fruitiness, maybe grape and citrus. Some caramel hints too.  Taste - Very sweet.. kinda citrusy. Malty with notes of caramel. Not very bitter at all for being a pale ale.  Mouthfeel - Pretty thick with very little carnonation.  Overall - This is very good for being a pale ale.
POSITIVE	Six generations of the Trum family have run the Schlenkerla Brewery Tavern in Bamberg Germany since 1405. Something very special lives here, and has done so epically since day one; the Aecht Schlenkerla Rauchbier Mrzen is a smokebeer of unparalleled quality and distinction. Banberg is the original home of the rich and powerful smokebeer, and Schlenkerla may be the most visited and traditional brewer of them all.  Aecht Schlenkerla Rauchbier translates to English as Original Schlenkerla Smokebeer, and since I first tried it, it has held a special place in my heart. It is undeniably unique with flavors that would drive some mad, and others mad with utter pleasure. The rich and penetrating smoky flavor is achieved by exposing barley to the intense aromatic smoke of burning beech wood during malting. Before kilning was mastered, this was really common practice, and most beers at one time were somewhat 'smoked'.  Really, the Schlenkerla is definitely not everyones bag, and as you read on you will see why. But those who do like this beer love it!  The Marzen comes in a 500ml bottle at 5.1% abv and is widely available at the LCBO. It is actually a lager, not an ale, contrary to what you may first perceive. But Schlenkerla does used bottom fermenting yeasts and ages it in oak in 700 year old cellars. The power of this beer comes not from its yeasts, but rather from the smoke, as you will soon find out.  In fact, you will find out the second you open this bottle. Immediately, before you even pour it, smoky bacon and charred wood will pour into the air engulfing your senses. While you could serve this beer at cellar, or even room temperature, I think it is best cool around 12C (54F). All the rich aromas and flavors are extremely potent when closer to warm, but it is still a lager and shows great refreshing characteristics and smooth crispness when cooler. Also, this way you get the best of both worlds; but pour at your own discretion.  Poured into a tall deep pint glass similar to Schlenkerla's own, it builds a richly brown mahogany beer with deep reds, amber and a golden haze. Carbonation is noticeable in the beer but not out of the ordinary. The head stood fluffy and dense a good two inches above the beer - creamy and off white in color, it is filled with air and also much power. Retention is excellent, and even by the end of the beer I was accompanied by a reasonable foam - not film, foam.  The nose is just crazy. The name Smoke Beer almost doesn't do it justice, it should be called crazy smoky sausage beer! But this is also what will ruin it for some people right away. But don't be timid. Forget about any prior conceptions of what beer can or should be. Just let your self go and focus solely on your senses, they will guide you to the light. The nose is wide and open with huge smoke flavors, hickory, smoked sausage, bacon and toffee. It is supremely rich, but absorb it and you will find caramel malts, biscuit, more toffee, a touch of earth and hayfield, then always the reminicent scent of campfire.  Don't prepare yourself for drinking this beer. Don't contemplate it, don't worry about it, don't over think it. Just let your mind relax and let the Schlenkerla sooth you. It enters your palate powerfully, but at first with softly rich and warming malts. Caramel and dark toffee mix with brown sugar and molasses for a moment as waves of smoky layers begin to make their way in. They are not pounding or aggressive; the beer is 5.1%, so you should not expect to be mutilated by its strength.  The first smoke I get is smoked sausage. It is powerful, with earth, herbs and some warm spice, maybe pepper. Next comes pure smoke and charred wood with hints of oak and malt. You can almost feel the smoke; it is very smooth and elegant. Yes, elegant. Even as potent as it is, it seamlessly orchestrates its way over your palate tickling all the right senses in all the right places. Some bitterness is detectable to add a touch of balance, but this beer by definition is unbalanced, and I love it for it. It is bold and beautiful in every way; it is very deserving of its rich heritage and loyal following.  The mouthfeel is easy and Soothing. Regardless of all the smoke, it still feels fresh and quenching, especially at the cooler temperature. Maybe quenching isn't right, but it is extremely satisfying and pleasurable to drink.  It can be hard to pair this marzen with food, but it can also be easy. Richly smoked cheeses, roast beef, ribs, pulled pork sandwiches, fried potatoes, and absolutely anything barbecued is a natural match for this magnificent beer. No doubt, it is one of my favorites, and will always have a place in my fridge.
NEGATIVE	Umm...this has some problems. First, highly overcarbonated. Wants to escape it's earthly bounds from my pint. Second, a very weak smelling stout. Weak coffee and chocolate at best. I'm being generous.  The taste. A lot of fizz but very little bang. Weak on flavor , strong on bubbles. Mild coffee and dark malt. Perhaps I got a bad batch but this is just horrid.
NEGATIVE	A: Poured from a bottle to a pilsener glass. Had an amber-red color and a cloudy texture. There was a decent amount of head and some OK lacing.  S: What I mainly picked up from the smell on this one is the alcohol, though some of the malt came through a little. Not very pleasant.  T: As with the smell, the alcohol pushes its way to the top. There's a hint of maltiness, but the alcohol is so oppressive it's kind of unbelievable.  M: A below average amount of carbonation and a slick finish. Medium-bodied.  D: I tried this one just for the experience of trying a Lithuanian beer. It seems to exist solely for the purpose of getting the drinker completely wasted, not for the enjoyment of drinking. It's not a nice beer to drink.
POSITIVE	This beer poured a nice medium amber color and formed a off white bubbly head that left some lace in a circular pattern.  The was medium amount of carbonation present.  The aroma was of spice, malt and a slight hint of alcohol.  The flavor was of malt, spice and a hint of clove.  The body was touch light for this style, but not bad.  The finish was a little astrigent and had elements of the alcohol.  A nice beer and one of their better ones.
NEGATIVE	Pours with color that is dark red with a bit of a haze, and a very nice tan head, that falls to a little bit of lacing.   Definite aromas of alcohol, toffee, and bread. Which you would expect with a Scotch Ale/Wee Heavy.   The taste has a bit of a malt. You can surely taste the alcohol notes up front, with some cocoa and bit toffee coming in the finish. Making it bitter and crisp.   Mouthful is very good as well, some scotch ales over play the alcohol, or they compeletly forget to put it in. This brew is pretty good by Founders. Its a heavy/strong brew that is easy to drink. I picked this up in a Founders Variety pack...would definitly pick it up again.
NEGATIVE	A - Clear and copper in color. Barely a thin little head.  S - Mostly cherries with a malty backdrop.  T - Cherries, watery and slightly sour with a bitter finish  M - Highly carbonated with an aftertaste reminiscent of an artificial sweetener.  No. Can't see myself trying to drink this one again.
NEGATIVE	Poured into a pint glass at Vermont Pub & Brewery.  A- Golden yellow with a finger sized white head.  S- Wonderful aroma of piney hops and citrus fruits.  T- Big let down as compared to the aroma. There seemed to be something missing. Very simple with not much flavor, just a watered down bitterness.  M- Medium to light bodied with some carbonation.   D- Would have been very drinkable if the taste followed the nose. Still a decent IPA.  Overall, highly disappointed in this beer. After taking a few whiffs, I thought I was in for a solid treat. However, this did not happen. The beer just seemed to be lacking some key ingredients and just fell short.
POSITIVE	In Akron this weekend for a wedding. Picked this one up from the brewery.  Pours a wonderful golden copper with a thin off white head. Has a wonderful aroma of fresh picked hops right off the vine. (not overwhelming of citrus or pine resin but quite nice.) taste is very balanced between malt and hops. While not as bitter as a traditional DIPA/IMPA it is quite enjoyable. Glad i grabbed several of these as is was not distributed to SC.
POSITIVE	fresh growler from the brewery this afternoon, poured into a straight sided pint glass.  A- light honey colored with a hint of an orange tint. Bright white head, which leaves fantastic lacing down the glass.  S- a slight sweetness, but mainly dominated by citric/piney hops. There is something a little extra to the sheer "density" of the aroma.  T- Simply put, fantastic. This is one of those benchmark beers for the style. Complexity abounds, from the sweet interplay of the malts and the hops that start a bit grapefruity, but turn a little piney and a little floral. There's even some tropical fruit aspects to the hops. It's a bit boozy throughout the sip, but it just fits the overall taste intensity of this beer. The finish is very, very long, and very, very good.  M- if you need to know what a creamy mouthfeel is for an IPA, drink this. light/medium carbonation  O- Love this brew. A must try for any double IPA lover.
POSITIVE	750 mL bottle, purchased June 2008, opened 22 Feb 2009.  Divine. These artisanal Belgian brewers continue to impress -- nay, wow -- me. Just when I think I've got the corner on the style potential and profile, I unturn another stone and discover another winner with something new to say.  Appearance: Unassumingly beautiful -- like a shimmering pumpkin in an evening glow. The color of Earl Gray tea, with lots of unflitered goodness swimming through the glass.  Aroma: Rich, mellow malt up front, with generous doses of wildflower honey, bergamot, and a faint twist of piquant hops. Smells like it might be overly sweet.  Taste: A joyride of rich malty warmth, with a twist of apricot, nectarine, and bergamot. Not too sweet at all, it is a garden of malted delights laced with a hint of well-placed subtle hops on the edge.   Palate: A tad bit sticky on the way down, but it tastes so damn delicious that I never want the bottle to end (which, at 9%, is a dangerous proposition!). It warms as it traverses the gullet.  Overall: I must replace this bottle twelvefold. I don't know what the 9 months in the cellar did for this one, not having tried it fresh, but my God this is an amazing beer. A keeper for sure! Oddly, I'm thinking good, rich Mexican/Latino cuisine with this one -- not your generic bean burrito, mind you, but the real authentic stuff, like homemade Mole sauce over wood-baked chicken, or those fried-and-baked taquitos that my Costa Rican nanny used to make. (Drooling on keyboard....) An artisanal cheese plate would be splendid here as well -- or baked brie.
POSITIVE	500ml bottle, shared, into 8oz glass: from notes. A: A good head retention, with a deep brownish body, that was dull and cloudy. lacing present. S: The main aroma was a smoky, roasted nutty malt. Deep, medium aroma, off aromas of cooked food, meat or vegetables. M/T: The body is a medium to full bodied taste, no real sweet flavors. Good amount of carbonation, with a nice malty character. Smoky off tastes, a very good intense smoked beer. D: This is a smoked beer that is not over the top smoke to the point that it would not be enjoyable. Good example of the style.
POSITIVE	($1.79 16.9oz can @ Total Wine in Kennesaw, GA).  Appearance: Pours a deep yellow body with a thick, though quickly diminishing white head. The cans are delightful. Gold, with an inlaid design.  Smell: Light breadiness in an aroma that is heavy on the Saaz with a nicely aromatic blend of spice and floweriness. Faint, faroff hint of diacetyl.  Taste: Buttered bread flavor with a light hint of honey followed quickly by a bright burst of Saaz hops bringing a floral spicy taste and just enough bitterness to keep things in check. Finishes with a lingering spiciness.  Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. Soft carbonation.  Drinkability: Well-balanced and makes for easy drinking. It's nice to have this available in cans to avoid any detracting skunkiness.
POSITIVE	A- Reddish-bronze in color with minimal head and sticky lacing  S- Some piney hop notes with a roasty zing underneath the hops   T- Some piney floral hops mixed with some roasted malt. The alcohol is well hidden. Pretty delicious   M- pretty full mouthfeel that has good balance and carbonation  D- Great tasting brew that stands out because of its unique style. Try one!
NEGATIVE	Thanks to Rageagainst123 for the trade!  Appearance: Pours a light brown with a couple fingers worth of head. Foam disappears to leave a layer of head that sticks around for a while. There is a decent amount of lacing as you go as well.  Smell: Coffee and a malty aroma are dominant here. Not much else, but what is there is decent.  Taste: A roasted coffee taste up front, which is joined by a malt taste toward the end. The sip is followed by a slightly unpleasant bitterness that lingers in the mouth for too long.   Mouthfeel: A bit thinner than I would have liked. The bitter aftertaste tskes away from this aspect as well.   Drinkability: The bitter flavors are too dominant here. If they were toned down and the roasted coffee was given the spotlight, this beer would improve quite a bit. If you enjoy this beer, though, this is a beer that you could drink plenty of given the smoothness and low ABV.
POSITIVE	Popping the cap revealed a bit of a gusher in the 22 oz. bomber, but when poured, the carbonation was reasonably in check and the head was about three finger thick. The body was very cloudy, burnt umber, and quite opaque when held up to the light, which was a very unusual trait for the style. The aroma was like raw pine resin and very nose singeing, which is the way I like my Double IPAs. The taste was bitter up front with a metallic tinge, surprised with the intense caramel malts evident as a very hefty backbone, and displayed a long earthy finish. The beer felt thicker than average in the mouth with a creaminess imparted by the yeast. I picked this up at Green's in Columbia, SC, during a recent visit, and it did not disappoint.
POSITIVE	2009 batch 3 version (thanks to jwjon1 for sending this one), poured into a Saint Arnolds sniffer, we did a side by side comparison with the Crusher version.  Appearance: Black with a thick mocha head about a finger thick, which quickly receded into a thin ring around the side of the glass.   Aroma: Coffee, chocolate, roasted grain, vanilla, and bourbon. I preferred the aroma in this version much more. The bourbon barrel aging added the extra complexity that the other version was missing.   Taste: Chocolate, coffee, bourbon, and alcohol. The flavors were kind of messy and a little bland, this might have been due to the aging.  Mouthfeel: Lighter body and mouth feel then its non-BA brother with medium carbonation.  Overall: I preferred the non-BA version to the BA version. The enjoyed the aroma of the BA version more but the flavor and the mouthfeel of the non-BA version was better in my opinion.
POSITIVE	I had this after drinking at a number of other pubs earlier in the evening and was kicking myself that I hadn't started at the brewpub first. I easily could have drank this all night, and if my wife could drive a manual transmission, I would have had another. To be honest, I almost missed this on the menu and was about to order something else when my eye caught the description and I noticed it was a saison. This was a beer entered into the microbrew festival. Basically it was a recipe that was passed around to a bunch of places and they all brewed the same thing, and this was theirs.  I was drinking it on their patio at night, so the lighting was odd and it was tough to get a clear idea of the color. Overall it seemed a hazy copper with a light colored head. Wonderful aroma that was sweet, spicy and citrusy just begging to be drank.  The flavor on this is just unbelievable. I had just come from a Belgian brewpub down the road, and this was better then what they put out. Wonderful malty sweetness, more then a hint of citrusy flavors, and a hint of spices present that really all worked great together. Medium bodied but nice crisp finish with a bit of lingering tartness.   Of all the beers I have had at the BRBP, this could be my favorite so far. I find it unfortunate that this may be a one time production, and hope they will offer this again on a more regular basis. I hope to get back there and have some more before it is gone for good, and just may have to send my wife over to pick up a growler. Fantastic and should not be missed.  Edit: I don't mean to imply that the Brugge Brasserie had made the same Saison when I say this was better then what I had there. I was trying to convey that Broadripple Brew Pub, known more for their English style ales, had on this occassion outdone the Brugge Brasserie with a Belgian style ale, at least compared to what I had had earlier that evening. I point out this comparison because the Brugge makes some truly fantastic Belgian beer and wanted to stress how great this beer was.
NEGATIVE	Now that the weather is getting warmer I wanted a light beer to enjoy in the evening. Pislner Urquell is an easy drinking beer with a crisp toasted malt flavor. It pours a clear yellow color with a white head that quickly fades to almost nothing. An herbal aroma with some light toasted malt mixed in greets you before each sip. As said before, this beer is crisp with a toasted malt flavor and a mildly bitter hoppy finish. The thin body helps this beer go down easy.  I typically drink lagers in the summer due to their light body and drinkability. This beer would be good at a BBQ or at a time when you just want something to enjoy without the flavors overpowering you.
POSITIVE	Pours a slightly hazy honey color with a short tight creamy head that settles into a solid ring. The aroma is of grapefruit hops; fairly fresh and juicy. The aroma is not as strong as I hoped but its nice. The flavor is all juicy hops with grapefruit being the main flavor though some light pine pops through. The hop profile focuses on the flavor not the bitter, which I enjoy. The malt is fairly light and takes a way backseat to the hops. The malt seems quite light for the style but it works. The feel is moderate with tingly carbonation, finishes slightly bitter. This is a very yummy pale ale. Nice hop profile with a light malt makes this extremely drinkable. This beer showcases what hops can taste like without bashing the tastebuds. I could easily kill the 4 pack in a short amount of time.
POSITIVE	Mmmm...this amber American Winter Warmer is darn tasty....sweet with a softly hoppy nose and body. really easy to drink so I had another pint.   Very nice and I liked it a lot. Nicely caramel with the hops keeping the malt from going overboard. Doesn't coat the mouth so it's tasty in that good way without being smackingly overwhelming.
POSITIVE	Comes out of the bottle a deep, opaque coffee sable with an average tan head. Rich, smoky, chocolaty, coffee-ish aroma has just a touch of sweetness and is very appetizing. Rich flavor is rather sweet and slightly bitter, and has woody, fruity and coffee components with a hint of unsweetened chocolate. Texture is fairly smooth and nicely fizzy with a firm but not fierce bourbon bite.
NEGATIVE	Poured from the bottle into a Weiss Glass  A - Pours a hazy gold with a two-finger off-white head. Head is gone about a minute after the pour. Leaves no lacing.   S - A bit of Coriander and orange peel on a sweet malt background. A bit musty as well.  T - Sweet upfront with malt and Coriander. The body of the beer is well balanced, but comes of weak and uninteresting despite the Coriander and hint of orange flavors. I think the yeast is coming away tasting musty, which isn't helping this brews cause... Coriander and sweet malt as the beer passes over the back of the tongue, leaves a sweet-orange aftertaste with a hint of bitterness.  M - Light bodied with moderate carbonation. About as expected.  A distinctly average offering here from Kirkland. The lack luster appearance put this brew on the wrong foot from the get go, and may have influenced other areas a bit. Not really bad, just so weak, textbook, and average that I won't be bothering with this beer in the future unless of if it were handed to me for free on a hot day. Plus the macro offering of this style (Shock top, Blue Moon) are better and more readily available in a pinch.
POSITIVE	Poured this beer from a bottle into a pint.   Good head, fades fast though; not as much lace as I had hoped.  Pours a rich amber color, a bit dark for an IPA; more like a brown ale.  The bouquet was quite pleasent. The last IPA I had had a skunky odor, so I was happy with this brew's aroma; definatly hopped, but not over the top.  Mouthfeel was decent. The brew fills your mouth and rolls around, giving you the opportunity to explore its body and flavors.  Pretty heavily malted, a bit to malty for a traditional IPA, but not bad, as I like the body that malt provides.   Finished with strong hop charachter.   All in all, I am very pleased with this IPA. Very drinkable on a hot summer day. I will be stocking up for July!
POSITIVE	Poured into a 12oz snifter.   Oil black, with a fine watery edge when shown through light. Foamy head with 3 fingers that dissipates slowly, leaving a nice layer on top. Great lacing, with clinging lines the whole way through.   Earthy roasted malts brings bittersweet cocoa and mild coffee aromas. Pleasant.  Nose is deceiving, as when it warms, the roasted malts come through rather strong on the palate. Unsweetened chocolate / coffee flavors predominate with a spicy hop finish balanced against a nutty return.  Watery mouthfeel in the beginning, though lingers through the mid taste and into the finish. Alcohol is off course absent in the taste, though you get a nice warming effect towards the end of the glass. With a mid-high abv, one or two is enough.   A very very nice porter, and a new favorite in my book. Honestly, a top notch porter, nutty and complex though drinkable
POSITIVE	Appearance: Strawberry blonde, with a creamy, tight lacing that hung on tight.  Smell: Very herbal and piney, I wouldn't venture out to say Nugget or Chinook, and Pat the brewer didn't want to name the types he used, but he did say it was a mix of West coast favorites. I don't think it was cascade, not citrusy enough. It also had remnants of ripe red fruits...  Taste: Just malty enough, discreet carbonation, smooth as silk, respectable hop prick that clings on the tongue and doesn't let go. In a land not known for their IPAs, this one stands out.
NEGATIVE	Poured from a 22oz bomber into my Dogfish Head shaped pint glass. Kind of a creepy label with big hop cones banging down your door out in space...  SAE/ECE Amber liquid, not quite clear with brighter amber highlights. A pale buff/cream crown of soft peaks recedes to a lasting finger, leaving behind crazed webs of fine sticky lacing.  Brewed with 100% Centennial hops at all stages and this shows - the signature C-hop bitterness is hinted at in the aromatics along with a blast of citrus, spicy evergreen, and floral scents.   The palate is likewise suffused with whole-cone dank hemp-y goodness with hints of orange zest, grapefruit, and an almost cedar-like woody/earthy element that is at least as much a contribution of the hardy (hearty?) malt backbone as it is derived from the hops - an unapologetically NW-style IPA, malt forward with a suggestion of wet stones and cocoa in the bitter, fruity finish.   Medium-full bodied, oily, almost sticky mouthfeel with moderate carbonation and a touch of warmth from the alcohol.   Some astringency in the finish makes it a sipper, and overall I think it does better with food (grilled salmon comes immediately to mind) than all on its lonesome.  Not as well balanced as their regular canned IPA, but that isn't the point of this series.
POSITIVE	A - Pours a hazy golden orange with small, thin head  S - Very, very good smelling. A good amount of grapefruit hops and peach, a bit of pineyness in the background.   T - Very, very sweet at the beginning, a lot of grapefruit hits right up front with mixtures of peach and orange before fading into floral and bitter pine hops.  M - The bitterness of the beer leaves the mouth a bit dry and parched. It seemed to kidnap all the moisture in my mouth. Cannot at all feel the heat of the alcohol, it's hidden very well. I do feel that the balance is just a bit off--a little more bitter than I would expect.  Overall - A great DIPA, I felt that the bitterness detracted just a bit from making it truly outstanding, as it felt like there was a little bit off in the balance. But a very, very good DIPA
POSITIVE	12oz bottle poured into a pint glass.  A: Dark body. Two-finger tan head leaves quite a bit of lacing.  S: Roastiness and smokiness.  T: More roasted malt. Slightly smoky. A hint of bitter chocolate. Even some citrus hop flavors.  M: Silky smooth with just enough carbonation.  D: I've generally found that porters don't do a whole lot to hold my interest. But this is one of the better ones. Recommended for fans of dark beers.
POSITIVE	amber in color with copious amounts of carbonation bubbling up toward the surface throughout. Nice white head on top, maybe an inch and a half before settling down to coat the inside of the glass for a minute. Interesting aroma, mix of grains, light bready malts, and a touch of a grassy, herbal hoppiness. Nothing crazy here but nicely balanced. Same could be said for the flavor, nice pale taste, light bready notes balancing a herbal sort of hop. Lightly sweet with a decent amount of carbonation
NEGATIVE	Thanks to BA schellsbeer for sharing this one with me!  Pours a dark brown color with ruby highlight with some tan foam that left very little lacing. Aroma of dry chocolate, some dark fruit, slightly sour smelling. Sweet flavor, slightest hints of coffee, rum soaked fruit, raisin, dark chocolate flavor is nice, but not overpowering. Slightly sour taste as well. I think this bottle might have some age on it. Nice creamy mouthfeel, carbonation is just right. It was an ok brew, but would probably be much better fresh. Drinkability stays low because of the funkiness and high ABV.
POSITIVE	12oz bottle poured into a snifter - fridge temp - 2008  Appearance: Pours a motor oil black right from the pour to the glass. The head is a slight 1/8" tall brown color, with little retention and slight lacing.  Smell: Wow. This is a whole new realm for me. It literally smells like a sweet cup of fresh coffee. Roasted coffee beans, milk chocolate, and some roasted malt. Wow.  Taste: Roasted malt, dark chocolate, and plenty of coffee flavor. This beer really does pay homage to coffee. Quite a roasty flavor.  Mouthfeel: Roasty like coffee with a nicely dry/sweet balance. The beer isn't cloying with sweetness. Slight boozy finish.  Drinkability: A very fine RIS. It absolutely screams with coffee, so you'd better enjoy it. I could drink a bunch of these, even in the morning for a quick pick-me-up. Awesome
POSITIVE	Looks decent, but the smell seems too malty, and not hoppy enough for an American IPA.  Taste is quite an improvement. Good balance, I can really detect the blending of malt and hops, with the hops adding just the right amount of zest for the malts. Hints of citrus, bread and yeast.  Nice mouthfeel, just the right amount of carbonation. Very nice.  When I had this, it was relabelled as "Opening Day Ale."
POSITIVE	Light roast aroma with malty sweetness underneath. Just a hint of citrus hops.  Dark brown with ruby highlights. Nice full 1/2 inch tan head that last for about the first 3rd of the pint.  Good malt flavor with solid but not overbearing hop bitering. A little bit of roast flavor but not as dry as a lot of examples of the style.  Medium bodied with good carbonation level. Lively and a little fizzy in the mouth.  Overall a good porter. I would prefer a little more roast but there's nothing really to complain about in this one.
POSITIVE	Pours a great copper color with large offwhite head that dies slow and leaves an immense ring down glass. Smell is strong; piney hops w/ citric notes and touch of spice and a sturdy malt base of caramel and some roasted malt as well. Smooth medium body, borderline creamy, with a great citric hop bite and minor sharp carbonation for a cutting beer. Balanced with minor sweet caramel and some roasted/toasted/dry malt feel so you get that pleasure of both citric notes (w/ a touch of pepper or coriander taste) and some sticky sweetness. A real dry, hearty finish lets you know you are drinking a well-balanced and made IPA and while not the greatest beer ever it is rock solid for an IPA w/ that wet, grassy, almost veg like feeling IPAs from the northwest have. A must try for anyone.
POSITIVE	Picked this one up at a gas station in the middle of nowhere, Utah. It was in the secret beer room, and I swear I received some withering stares from some of the gas station's patrons. I bought it to take home to give out to non-ba friends, but ended up drinking a couple because it was pretty good. Good notes of both dark and milk chocolate, along with roasted malt. The 4.0 abv makes it easy to put these away fairly quickly and easily.
POSITIVE	a - see through, but somewhat cloudy. white head.  s - smell is sour and funky. sweet cherries buried deep.  t - same as nose, but in opposite order. sweet cherries on the front, followed by funk and sour.   m - medium body. on the bigger side of carbonation, making it feel lighter and refreshing.  overall - very drinkable. i was expecting something sweeter and fruitier. this is more along the lines of a sour or farmhouse. Its a good beer though. cherry flavor rounds it out well.
POSITIVE	From 12oz bottle to Bruges hybrid glass on 10/14/11 *From notes  Bottle Date: 10/6/11  A: An oil spill in a glass. Dark and brooding - a generous pour yields a dense two finger head. The rentention is impressive, as are the gobs of lacing rimming the glass.  S: Freshly brewed black coffee and melted dark cocoa.  T: Jesus is this fresh: the coffee wrecks immediate havoc on my poor palate. It's like the best damn diner coffee you've ever had, but in beer form. Unsweetened dark chocolate slams across the mid, and the two parts equal an epic whole, as they wash over the finish, hand in hand. This is absolutely fantastic.  M: Liquid chocolate. It coats my mouth, my throat and I'm sure my tummy too.  O: I really can't believe it took me this long to review Founders Breakfast Stout. I've bought cases of this stuff and never once laid down a review? Fail, Rhettroactive.  It goes without saying that this is one of my favorite, easily accessible beers. And having had it both aged and now insanely fresh, I absolutely believe this needs to be consumed ASAP to be enjoyed to it's fullest. Seek this out kiddies, as it'd be a sin not to.
POSITIVE	12 oz bottle poured into a pint glass  A: Rich amber color. Decent sized head which left lacing all down the glass.  S: some grapefruit, hoppy smell, and spices.   T and M: Very smooth at first. Can taste some grapefruit, then spices dominate followed by alcohol and a bitter hop finish that lingers.   D: More bitter than i expected, but this is the first Rye beer that I have tried so I read the description of the style and tried to write my review with that in mind. I would like to get one or two other rye's and see how this stacks up to them.
POSITIVE	A - Pours a clear copper with a good head of thick, dense foam.  S - Sweet malt, resinous pine, grass and a light grapefruit round out the aromas.  T - Big alcohol in this - no surprise there. Big hops - also no surprise. Bitterness isn't overwhelming though. Very sweet, but it's in balance with the other big flavours - pine, citrus, some sweet fruitiness (mangoes and pineapple come to mind).  M - Substantial to say the least. Thick and almost chewy.  D - Very nice. Big flavours that the alcohol doesn't overwhelm.
POSITIVE	Alcohol, some malt bourbon, some cherry, masked  good carbonation, still cheery, very toasty almost charted, inside of barrel,  quick head white creamy lace, dark copper with deep red higlights  bourbon at front front, finished slighlty dry with warm bourbon tinge typical of bourbon alone.   Betty drinkable such a high alcohol beer
POSITIVE	Thanks goes out to a few great traders who have sent me this one  The bottle poured into a tulip glass produced a large two fingers worth of tan head on top of a thick jet black body   Aromas of dark chocolate, coffee, and oats with a nice background of caramel and vanilla this has one of the best smells of any stout I have tried   These tastes like you are eating a big dark chocolate bar while drinking a great cup of espresso with just enough caramel sweetness To keep things from being overly bitter   It poured like molasses nice and thick in the mouth as well with just enough carbonation to keep things interesting   One a night would be my max on this one, but I wouldn't mind drinking this a few nights in a row. A great all around stout
POSITIVE	This version weighs in at 7.5% ABV, decanted into a Duvel Tulip. Above average head retention & lacing  Bomber pours an effervescent mahogany with 2+ fingers of tan colored head.  S: Dirt, a bit of chocolate, & some figs & alcohol as this warms  T: Chocolate, a bit of iron, some leafy hops, & slight fruittyness (think dates, raisins, figs) up front. Roasted grain, earthyness, a whisper of licorice, & much more fruittyness, as this warms. Finishes dry with a bit boozey warmth, & jammyness, & bit of peppery hops, plus some booze warmth. Almost gave this a bump to 4.5 on taste   MF: Medium bodied, low carbonation, & fairly dry  Drinks fairly easy for the style & abv. I'd put this up against Allagash any day
POSITIVE	I'm guessing here, but I've got a hunch that Northern Lights brews an "Anniversary Ale" every year and that 2009's model, #16, is actually a lager. Everything about this beer, from the rich, grainy aroma and taste, to its pale yellow clarity with steady carbonation and white lather says "lager." The mash tun fragrance is delightful, and the flavor is dry and crisp as a $20 bill. The sustained bitter tail is perhaps exaggerated in that overzealous American way. But the beer satisfies heartily.
POSITIVE	Dark, rusty copper, with a sticky, big, light-tan head. Very nice. Smells of honey-dipped biscuit malt and light toffee. Big, resiny, grapefruit hops too. Taste starts out with brief toffeeish malt. Not real sweet. Biscuity base quickly gives way to tangy, acidic, ruby-red grapefruit juice. Hops are in control now! Appetizing bitterness swells into the oily, tart finish. Faint trace of malt, but not much. Medium-full bodied APA. Brash, acidic hoppiness accentuated by refreshing carbonation. A very well-made West coast style APA...from Kentucky. Thanks to kmpitz2 for smuggling this into Utah.
NEGATIVE	The first pour was a hazy red hued caramel color without a head and no lacing, but the last, warmer snifter, when poured aggressively yielded a full finger loose light tan head. A couple of seconds after the pour a thin film of bubbles manages to momentarily stir to the surface. It smells rich and syrupy; caramel malt and maple syrup. The mouth feel is very heavy and syrupy with negligible carbonation. Full flavored, the caramel and honey taste finishes with a salty aftertaste. Definitely a sipper. I really appreciate FFF producing something special to let us all celebrate this significant anniversary.
NEGATIVE	Appearance: Nice big white head when poured into a Hacker-Pschorr Weisse glass. Hazy middle yellow color, lots of carbonation.  Smell: Smells very lightly citric and grainy.  Taste: More light citrus (orange), and grain. not a whole lot going on here, misses many of the flavors associated with a Hefe Weizen.  Drinkability: Not offensive whatsoever, but is missing quite a bit in the flavor department.
NEGATIVE	Thanks to CooperEllis for sharing a bottle of this with me while we worked on the Secret Santa 2010 BIF box we're putting together.  It definitely got me working. Appearance is thick black and ruddy, basically the same as CBS. Smell is bourbon. Although it's tempered by a bit of chocolate and malt. Not too much though. It's a very heavy smell. The taste is like the regular base beer ... plus hints of bourbon. Could be leftover from the nose and not really in the beer itself, but the effect is the same. Finish is clean and it leaves you warm inside.  The mouth is full, carbonation low but its thick enough to coat the palate. I have to knock the drinkability though. I appreciate the regular Breakfast Stout (although a different beer) more than the CBS/KBS stouts because I feel like it got the booze right. This is too much. Without a doubt powerful though.   Side note: I want to make KBS and Brooklyn Black OPS into creatures and watch them fight.
POSITIVE	I'm not a fan of overly sweet anything but this beer is outstanding.   A: Pours a pinkish-orangey color. Thick, creamy, light-pink head from the nitro.  S: Smells sweet and fruity, but not sickeningly so.  M: Creamy mouthfeel.  T: Amazing. Fruity, but not too sweet. The two years spent aging in bourbon barrels give it a nice smooth, delicate flavor.
POSITIVE	First off I must offer immense thanks to hoppymeal for sending this and other treats to me so speedily and kindly I owe him big time.  Woke up around 11:00 oclock to day (I dont work until around 4) cracked this immediately after a shower around 11:45 and damn am I happy. Chilled and poured into my Three Floyds nonic, head rose a good inch and a half and lingers now a couple centimeters above the surface. A dark milk chocolate color leaving wonderful foamy lacing like a wave washing on the walls of my glass. The body is as black as black can be like brand new polished black leather. The nose is fabulous tons of dry roast kona coffee, hints of vanilla from oak, rich dark chocolate and a subtle saltiness. I can only smell a small suggestion of bourbon aroma, which is perfect. To me most bourbon aged beers have good aromas, but are a tad too cloying or harsh, however this is so well done it makes me sick. I get no real hop aroma in comparison to the big bold, dare I saw magically malt/ dry roast coffee aromas. Alcohol is not really present in the aroma, it is amazing how well it is hidden.  The flavor is equally amazing perfectly well balanced, just enough bitterness to support the superior malt complexities. I can taste coffee, bitter chocolate and hints of vanilla with a great Kona backend. Even after I swallow I can still smell it almost as if it is seeping out. Mouthfeel is not as thick as I thought it was going to be for strength which makes this even better. I feel like their mash temps matched with other proceeders / ingredients are so well chosen and performed, its like magic, great work, I am so blown away. I could drink this every morning for the rest of my life. This has to be one of the most quaffable big beers I have ever consumed. I now know what all the buzz around this beer is about and it is every bit deserved.
NEGATIVE	pours a cloudy yellow color with a good head that leaves lace down the glass. lots of bubbles. i think the haziness might be due to this beer having the same fate as the brooklyn pils i bought from the same store... mystery born on dating.  smells bready... typical pilsner   very light beer some hop bite up front a little malt sweetness afterwards.   this is a very light, crisp beer thats very drinkable, but not too much on taste. id probably drink this before a macrobrew, but i wouldnt really seek it out.
POSITIVE	Poured into an imperial pint at 45F. Thanks to my gf's mom for a lovely Easter present!  A - Poured a lovely dark amber, the color of a dark violin bow rosin, with copper hues in the light. A lovely off-white creamy head that retained wonderfully and gave ample lacing all over the glass. True eye candy right here. 5.0  S - Lovely esters, hint of pears and apricots, a biscuity backbone and a bit of earthy hoppiness. A hint of sweet tobacco and leather rounds out the nose. 4.0  T - A rather robust beer, hints of sweet caramel and light fruits are followed closely by raisins and earthy hops, lending a bit of bitterness near the finish, and finishes mildly roasty with a touch of metallicness and caramel. 4.0  M - Medium bodied, or at least, that's the perception that the carbonation gives me. Rich and satisfying, a touch of dryness in the finish. 4.0  D - Quite. I finished the bottle pretty quickly and wanted more. 4.0
POSITIVE	dark slightly ruby brown. i coudn't coax too much of a head out of this. malty aromas prevail with toffee and buttery ripe dark fruits raisin mostly. at times i pick up a pumpernickel smell. some caramel as it warms. juicy malt and toffee dominate the taste a fruitiness sort of like apple cider. a faint spiced flavor goes a long with it. there is a little bit of a peaty flavor to be found here, but it is covered up a lot by some of the rich malt flavors. some bitterness balances things out some. caramel and chocolate come out in the taste with some warmth. full rich mouthfeel lends itself well to the flavors. good drinkability for relatively high alcohol. a good sipping beer and a solid scotch ale. i'd like to see some more peat in here though.
POSITIVE	Appearance- Fairly dark almost midnight appearance. A nice tan head retention with left over lacing.  Smell- Very inviting. A mixture of coffee, chocolate with hints of alcohol, and malts. Not as inviting as some stouts but definitely up there.  Taste- This beer is perfection for a big stout. All the flavors come through but nothing is over the top. There does not seem to be any flaws with the taste profile and the balance is absolutely divine. It's rare to drink a beer with so many flavors with such texture that is balanced from start to finish but this one is. I love our rich and creamy it is and how smooth it is on the palate.  Mouthfeel- Outstanding for a heavy stout. A lot of imperial stouts have a heavy feeling on the palate or have a overpowering flavor note or carbonation, not this beer. Despite all the ingredients and complexity on my palate, it is very silky and smooth.  Drinkability- Very high for an imperial stout. I could easily drink 3 or 4 of these. Very stunning for a beer over 8% ABV but despite being thick, it sits delicately and goes down absolutely smoothly.  Overall- I can't recommend this beer enough. Easily the best coffee beer out there and outstanding with the oatmeal and chocolate. The key killer about this beer is the balance. Other beers have stronger notes but nothing I've had is this balanced. Truly a brewing masterpiece.
POSITIVE	Poured from a 12oz bottle into a 20oz imperial pint. Thanks to HollyAnn for the hook up!  Bottled on: Jan/Week 2 (2008 I assume)  A: Pours a hazy pale gold color with a creamy white head that's two fingers in height. Although fed by some active carbonation the head dies pretty quickly, leaving a small amount of lace behind.  S: Nice yeasty aromas of banana and clove followed closely by some tart fruit and a mild breadiness.  T: Enjoyable yeast flavors (banana, clove, and bubblegum) that have biscuit-y, bread-y, and toasted crustiness nipping on their heels. Also along for the ride is pepper and a tart and slightly sour citrus flavor that lends some balance.  M: Pretty chewy and pleasantly spicy on the tongue. Interesting peeks of dry/toasted malt.  D: Very good. I bet this is very popular around Nashville in the summertime.
POSITIVE	Retaste on 4-25-08....  The cocoa characteristics are subduing now and a richer roasty maltiness is emerging...definitely needed a little time to age...the cocoa is evident still but not overwhelming and the true bock characteristics are exerting themselves a little more...moving the scores upward a little --- *Billed as a bock/schwartzbier blend.  A-Auburn brown color with some redish notes...big creamy tan head.  S-Aroma is sweet dried cocoa powder...definitely more schwartzy smelling.  T-Very sweet..pretty one dimensional with the chocolate and cocoa.  M-A lager for sure...just too sweet  D-More schwartzy like than bock like....missing the bock like flavors I look for...no toasted notes..maybe the cocoa just overrides it...I have to assume either a munich or vienna malt base was used for a bock. The chocolate flavor is the primary flavor but it comes through too sweet and cloying for my liking.   I think this one has some potential but needs some tweaking with the recipe....not a bad beer by any means. It has no off flavors or home brew characteristics...it is just too one-sided with the cocoa...
POSITIVE	Poured from a firkin during Philly Beer Week at TJs in Paoli. Poured into a tulip glass. This is a dry hopped version of the Double IPA in the firkin.  A: A cloudy orange color with a think bubbly head. Not much glass lacing because of the firkin.  S: Pine and citrus really jump from the dry hopping. More so than the normal beer of course. Rich caramel and sugar sweetness and some alcohol smells.  T: Citrus hops with some pine and floral qualities that get quickly overcome by the huge caramel and sugar sweetness. Some of the citrus hops linger but become subdued. Alcohol creeps in on the back end but is not unwelcomed. A much better beer with the dry hopping to give it some more hops punch.  M: Full, coating, alcoholic and sticky.  D: Pretty good, it was way more enjoyable than the regular DIPA.  Overall a real nice twist to the beer that really wakes it up a bit. A very drinkable and enjoyable DIPA that was very nice from firkin.
NEGATIVE	12 oz bottle poured into Sam Adams glass yielded a decent head which disapated to nothing faster than Usain Bolt runs 100M. Smell is not pleasing, a bit like bad apple cider. Taste is unremarkable, overripe pears, not much in the way of hops. Hate to say it, because I suppose this stuff qualifies as craft beer, but I'd rather have something "super cold" or "triple-hopped" than this. With a fridge full of great beer ready and waiting, this one went down the drain.
POSITIVE	On-tap at brewery in a pint glass.  A - Nice light golden yellow color with a little bit of white head that stays for a while.  S - Light smell of citrus and some malt but thats really it.  T - Nice malty flavors with a good citrus finish. Very light.  M - Light bodied with good carbonation.  D - Good beer. I used to frequent Summit Station before I moved to OH and before they changed management to Growler's. This is their mainstay beer. They didn't used to have any beers on tap that were not house brews and this is what they suggest to anyone who like BMC's. It's a great beer to enjoy out on the patio bar in the summer while hanging out with your friends.
NEGATIVE	Pours a mostly clear dark reddish brown with thin offwhite head, spotty lace. Smell: sweet, a little brown sugar but mostly nondescript and grainy...why do I smell a lot of pale malt?, light banana and pear, spice. Smells like a dark tripel. Taste: again sweet, caramel - overcarmelized, spicy, pear, import graininess (ehh?). Mouthfeel: way undercarbonated for the style and a little thin as well. The local giant liquor store was pushing Pike with prime shelf space and ads, but Pike has done nothing well here.
NEGATIVE	Another Thanksgiving day treat split with Jwiss22. Love pumpkin beers and how much better they make fresh pumpkin pie taste. Here goes...  A- A very nice pour yields a darker amber color that is not expected, but very appealing to gaze at. Darker than pumking and looks just as appetizing. A very nice stream of bubbles presents a thin white head that dissipates quickly. I love how it looks reminds me faintly of lighter pumpkin bread. Can't wait to indulge.   S- Right away a greeting of fresh pumpkins followed by nutmeg, cinnamon and I want to say clove. Quite intriguing and lovely to smell. I am picking up more of the spices as it warms they are overpowering the pumpkin and leaving it in the back. It's making me drool as this is one of my favorite seasonal styles.   T- Tons of the nutmeg, cinnamon and other spiciness used in pumpkin pies. Lovely taste not a lot of pumpkins very faint because it is dominated by the spices used. As it warms I get a subtle crust taste, but not as much as I would like because the spices take over.   M- Coats the mouth and leaves you awaiting your next sip. The carbonation is there and melds well with all the spices leaving them lingering around. Enjoyable, but a little chewier than others, probably the malt bill chiming in to leave it fuller bodies than some pumpkin brews.   D- As like most of this style its a desert beer not a session beer. It is to be enjoyed with pumpkin pies, sweet potato pies, cranberry sauce. For the high abv its fairly drinkable, but I will stick to the tried and true Pumking for now.   A great representation for the style, up there with the greats of this style. Very pleasing and would try again next season to see if the recipe changes. Would like more pumpkin less spice or maybe even a vanilla pinch to throttle down the cinnamon and nutmeg.
POSITIVE	Poured into a pilsner glass a light straw color with a nice fluffy white head that stuck like glue as it settled,very German in the nose toasted grain and mineral qualities with a touch herbalness saaz maybe?Very dry pils here dry toasted malt underneath a dry,somewhat herbal hop profile I do notice a s I drink more a freshly baked bread elemeant to it that adds to its subtle complexities of malt vs hop.A damn fine pilsner one of the better to come my way in a while for sure.
POSITIVE	One of a kind. They only make it every so ofton. This beer cost more than any other beer they brew and you can taste evey bit of it. Definitly one of their best. Dark color with a hop aroma smell. Taste thick with three times the flavor of a regular IPA. Expensive but a must have. It's only around once a year if that so sit down and drink one.
POSITIVE	This brew has a dark purple/brown body, with a good sized foam, tan head. The scent is mostly campfire. The taste of this brew has sweet malts in front, clean caramel. Light hop bitterness. Everywhere yet excellently blended is the subtle smoke influence, but after the first sip it blends in so well that it doesnt stick out. Creamy mouth.   This brew turns aroound my opinion about smokey beers. The ones ive had before were not as well done as this, great brew.
POSITIVE	poured a slightly hazy, reddish copper color wit a large head to start, that fell to a sticky lacy ring. Smell is a perfect combination of hops and roasted malt, with some caramel noted. Taste is very refreshing with the malt and hops coming together nicely, with neither dominating, but really complimenting each other in good proportions. Finish is a bit subtle for my liking, but still enjoyable. I found this to be an easy drinking beer that was thirst quenching. Would make a great session beer.
POSITIVE	Had on tap at DLD, was the second to last person to get it before the keg was kicked.   A-Dark, dark black. Some lacing is left.  S-Coffee chocolate, molasses and roasted malt.  T-So sweet! Chocolate, roasted malt and coffee. Some molasses and vanilla are apparent as well. Some bitterness in the finish. Great balance.  M-Thick and syrupy. Very smooth.  O-Wow. Going to DLD was worth it for this beer. I can't believe how easy drinking as smooth this great tasting beer is.
POSITIVE	Let me say this first: this may be the ugliest beer I've seen. It brings new definition to the word "murky". Having helped brew a double IPA loaded and dry hopped to the 'enth degree as well, I do know it will turn out nothing but murky. For this reason I cannot hold it against the beer - but hot damn, this looks like polluted swamp water!   A tarnished, almost radioactive looking orange colour. There was hardly any fizzle off prying the cap - to no surprise there is no head either. There is, however, plenty of little signs of carbonation in the form of bubbly trims and dotty lacing.   The smell is pure Founders - which is to say a hoppy aroma that I've come to recognize as being so distinct to the brewery. So hoppy, so alcohol filled, yet so smooth and seductive. Hop resin, so much hop resin. An explosion - like every character of every hop I've ever smelt. Fruity. Floral. Herbal. Piny. Spicy. Awesome.  And a quick word of advice. If you truly want to appreciate the beer in all its hoppy glory be sure to seek out a fresh bottle and regardless of the alcohol content do not, I repeat, do not let it age. You don't know Devil Dancer unless you've had it fresh. Really fresh.   The mouthfeel is surprisingly balanced with nearly as much malt as there is hops. Although equally sensed it is the hops that are tasted most. Grilled citrus and syrupy resins. There's nearly no alcohol present and this has an unexpectedly mellow persona. Nothing but toasty, caramel smothered malts, sticky resin and exotic fruits - every hop head's dream.   If the devil did brew a beer this is likely the kind of tantalizing, tempting tipple I bet he'd brew. Wheat Wine. Double IPA. Triple IPA - whatever it is it is something unique and something special. It is also a fantastic drinking beer, especially given its strength. I'm always down for a dance with the devil - it's ironically a rather heavenly experience.
NEGATIVE	Situation: a night off from the to-do list... Glassware: Ommegang Rare Vos... Appearance: slightly opaque, dark chestnut red body with a thick, attractive nestling of bubbly off-white head....nice, yet inconsistent lacing on glass as it drains.... Aroma: soft, understated malts with only a late hop fragrance--hints at easy drinking to come... Palate: solid, slightly oily body that is rather smooth to the throat; malts steady the tongue nicely... Taste: smooth, dry taste reminiscent of a bock in its malty strength; lingering aftertaste holds slightly nutty notes... Overall: pleasant but not overstated in any facet of flavor--a nice case filler or case by itself... though smoother, nuttier, more buttery ESBs can be found, this pleases the tastebuds just fine...
NEGATIVE	A: Poured a chestnutt color with good carbonation leaving a dirty white cap and some lacing  S: Booze, candy sugar, bourbon, vanilla and caramelized sugars are the standouts  T: First thing I notice is a big sweet, stickiness with candy sugar, booze, caramelized sugars with bourbon, vanilla. Medium way I spy a sherry and cherry taste with hints at dark fruits and bubblegum  M: Sticky sweet, thinner than I expected, boozy, low carbonation and heavy but thin. Lots of sweetness on this leaves me wanting to check my blood sugar. Syrupy, gooey and a bit bitter  O: A pretty good take. Not impressed as the ratings are a a bit inflated. Definitely not the trade demand it drives.
POSITIVE	My first bottle in several years. On first cracking the crown, the aroma wafts out, of smoked ham. I'm getting hungry and thirsty all at once. Very hazed amberish hue, tight ring of cream-toned foam. Aroma: smoked salmon, minus the salmon. My powers fail beyond that...traces of wheat malt, but it's smoke all over the place. taste: smoke at the fore, then smooth and refreshing, with that cured meat feel all over the palate. Smoked-meat feel lingers long in the flavor, and you can get the essence of a dunkel weizen under it, but it's well hidden. Tastes as nice as a good dunkel, and halfway through, the smoke lessens and the character feels a touch more normal.  I'm drinking this long after dinner, and now I'm yearning for some sausage or something. Quite an appetizing brew. Couldn't take it if I didn't like smoked meat, so take that as your cue, whether or not it's for you. Medium-bodied, with a lightly smoky, smooth finish. Very drinkable, once over the smoke. One of the world's most unique, and more rewarding brew. Marzen and Urbock left to conquer.
POSITIVE	12 oz bottle poured into mug.  A: Pours pale yellow-orange. Creamy white head sticks to glass all the way down. A visually appealing beer. If I saw someone drinking this in a bar I'd definitely have to try it.  S: Malt and hops! Citrusy hops at that. Very appetizing.  T: Lightly sweet malt flavor blends well with oily, citrusy hop flavor. Medium hop bitterness with a fair amount of hang. Bitterness, while not high, is aggressive and with the hop flavor gives an effect similar to grapefruit juice. Perhaps a little out of balance - could use a greater malt presence.  M: Light-medium body and moderate carbonation.  D: I could drink a few of these on a sunny afternoon. Overall this is a good beer. Not spectacular, could be more balanced, but worth a purchase for sure.
POSITIVE	The beer poured a golden orange color and the head quickly disappeared. The carbonation made my burp almost instantaneously. The smell was grainy, with not much going on. Something bad in the aroma at first.  The taste was more interesting than I expected. Crispy, with a nice sweetness, I found some caramel in it, which made the mouthfeel smooth and enjoyable. An aspect of classic basic lager makes the beer taste like many others (or many others taste like this beer), but I found the caramel thing interesting. The aftertaste is hoppy and thicker than I expected.   The kind of beers you drink liters of in a session. Good, but not exceptional.
POSITIVE	A- Dark, amber/brown with a bubbly, off-white head.  S- Kind of weak on the nose. I get some caramel malts and a doughy quality.  T- Pretty complex taste. Toffee and caramel malts mixed with toasted bread. Notes of oak and tobacco jump out as well. Leaves nice lingering bitterness.  M- Medium body with a medium carbonation.  D- I'm not a huge fan of this style, but this isn't a bad representation of what a scotch ale should be.
NEGATIVE	This, along with the Black Cobra, are the two main beers for this establishment and this was the first one that I tried. I wasn't sure what to expect, but I like wheats so I was getting ready to really like this beer. It looked a little like a standard hefe, except for the head. The color was a nice cloudy golden with a maybe too bleach-white head that seemed a mismatch, sort of. Whatever. The smell was fairly pleasant bread-dough, yeasty and fresh but quite faint and not outstanding. The taste was a nice blend of grain flavor, with a much higher hop character than I was expecting. The yeasty bread and malt flavors were matched by a lemon-rind bitterness with a very clean and dry finish. Actually there really wasn't an aftertaste. The mouthfeel was medium to light, refreshing but perhaps on the watery side which reduced the flavor a bit. The drinkability was decent; this was a fairly standard flavor and not too strong but I can't really see myself craving this or wanting to go back for more without a good reason.
POSITIVE	what did you expect? It's not bourbon barrel aged. There are no IBUs listed on the bottle.   It's a light beer.   When you're counting calories or just want a lower ABV beer to drink, and doesn't taste terrible, this is what you want. Isn't it?   I remember in college we always thought this was the best tasting light beer.   Isn't it still?
POSITIVE	I was lucky enough to get two bottles of this, and wow, did I enjoy them both. Really rich aroma with a hint of sweetness which completely translates into the taste. You can take multiple sips and each time get different hints of chocolate, coffee, maple or bourbon, depending on what you focus on. Simply an achievement of a beer.
NEGATIVE	A nice chocolate flavour comes in this dark brew. it has ruby tones when held up to the light. The head on mine was very thin and tan (sounds like I'm writing about a model). This one is also sweet. It would be nice with a meal or with vanilla ice cream even. A fine beer but one is enough due to the sweetness.
POSITIVE	Had at the Flying Saucer in Nashville  Poured a crisp burnt orange with 2 fingers of bright white head. Slowly faded into a thin film but produced excellent lacing.  Big pine notes with some prominant mango notes. Solid caramel malt finish  Taste follows the nose. Great pine resin taste up front with some delicious mango backing it up  A little light in the body for my taste... Good amount of carbonation. Drying hoppy aftertaste. Produced a little bit of hop dragon breath.  Overall, a tasty and refreshing IPA. Great smell and taste but a little on the thin side for my taste. Would not turn another one down by any means. Definitely worth trying
POSITIVE	A- A beautiful orangy amber color. Had a quick light white head, that faded very quickly.   Smell- Smells sweet with a strong scent of booze. Some light whisky and oak notes come through, but the booziness is dominant  Taste- Has a nice smooth initial vanilla taste, that fades to a nice barley/wheat wine flavor. I say barley wine, because I have never had another wheat wine, and that is all I can equate it to. The booziness is very noticable, but not as overpowering as I expected.  Mouth- As with most Founders beers I've had, the mouth is excellent. Has a nice thick and smooth mouth feel. It might be a little flat, but I like it, and I think it suits the style.  Drinkability- Very drinkable, despite the higher ABV. I plowed through my first one, and I feel like I could drink 3-4 more no problem.  Another very solid offering from Founders. Glad I was able to get my hands on a few to try. Thanks to bill914 for making this all possible  -Gfunk
POSITIVE	On tap at Tria.   First, I've gotta say that if I were to brew a beer in honor of Michael Jackson, it wouldn't have been a pilsner. That being said, at least it was a really good pilsner.   A: Golden color, big white head.  S: Alcoholic warmth, spicy hops.  T: The first sip lef tme with a "meh, another pilsner" sensation. Subsequent sips proved refreshing and a little more complex. Decent malt backbone and well-balanced hop bitterness.  M: Creamirer and thicker than a normal pilsner. Well-played, Stoudts.  D: Pretty sessionable.
NEGATIVE	While watching the Red Sox / Yankees game I thought it was time to review Hoppin Frog Mean Manalishi Double IPA . Sharp looking label with a frog holding a mug of beer in his left hand . Poured into a Brooklyn Brewery pilsner glass nice thick foamy head and beautiful tawny color . There is not freshness date on the label . After a few minutes the head has now become concave in the glass . Like a dimple on a golf ball . Hoppin Frog is from Ohio . Maybe this will be the 3rd best thing to come out of Ohio . 1st being DEVO . 2nd The Pretenders ( before Honeyman-Scott and Farndon had their drug issues ) . The aroma is hoppy and citrusy , just like the taste . It is good but not the flavor hop bombs that I enjoy . The heat in my cheeks is here halfway through the bomber . I wish there was more hop kick and punch in this . It is a good brew but I guess I am a hop bomb junkie now .
NEGATIVE	Some gold in the light body, with a detergent soapy vine crown. Not great smell a little cheesy.On the thin side, the rye has attitude and for 5% it's got mouthburn. A weak lager but there is something to drink on a hot night.Typical Trafalgar except that the carbonation is understated.
POSITIVE	This was the clear winner of our five beers tasted. Of the 10 tasters, it received three overall ratings of 5 and six overall ratings of 4. The one woman who did not enjoy the beer (rating of 2) admitted that the coffee tones were very nice in both the taste and the nose. The consensus was, even among those of us not usually into stouts, that the dryness of the oatmeal/imperial styles kept it from being too thick or overpowering. It was balanced well enough that many were surprised it had such a high abv.  Overall average: 4.1
POSITIVE	The beer poured crystal clear medium amber brown with an off-white frothy head which rose very tall and fell slowly to lace the glass.  The aroma was smoky and interesting with a summer sausage smoke presence coupled with a fruity aromatic. Some light wisps of wheat came through the smoke, but for the most part the aroma was smoke.  The flavor was light with a wheat flavor coupled with a large flavor of smoke. The beer contacted the palate slightly crisp and fruity and emerged with more fruit the longer the beer contacts the palate. The smoke began to diminish in the flavor as the palate began to fatigue.  The finish was dry with a lasting fruit flavor and wheat and a definite smoke impression. The body was medium and well done. A very easy to drink and refreshing beer without much complexity and with moderate smoke levels.  16.9 ounce bottle. $3.59 at Wine Warehouse in Charlottesville, VA.
POSITIVE	GLASS: Snifter TEMP: Cellared @ approx 50 degrees  Pours a lightly amber tinted, medium shade of crimson/ruby. A head of almost two-fingers worth of tan foam forms, then dissipates to a nice edge-to-edge surface film. The lacing is rather impressive.  Lots of hops notes come forth from this one. Big hints of pine resin, along with citrus notes and light tropical fruit hints. Nice bits of floral and grassy elements. Surprisingly, there seems to be a decent hint of background maltiness, as well.  Okay....it's not as out-of-balance as I expected, given it's reputation, but it's still nowhere near balanced. You can tell that Founders tried to balance it out a little bit, the hops are just too overwhelming. A good amount of grapefruit and citrus zest comes through and mixes with big notes of sticky pine resin and oil. Some mild hints of malt sweetness is on the tail-end and buried underneath, trying to bring some balance, but not quite getting all the way there.  This has a medium-to-full body and a light-to-medium level of carbonation. It is very smooth and has a nice touch of creaminess.  The out-of-balance hop presence, combined with the 12.00%abv will keep you from reaching for this one over and over. A very great every now and then kind of beer.
POSITIVE	1st batch.  A - Black as pitch. Not much of a head. Just a slick of bubbles across the top and a ring around the glass.  S - Whiskey up front. Then chocolate notes as well as some roastiness.  T - The whiskey is more subdued in the taste than the smell. The chocolate and roasted malt pop more. Hints of vanilla and oak. Pretty tasty.  M - Thick and creamy.  D - Highly drinkable for a high ABV beer.
POSITIVE	A:pours a hazy orange with two fingers of white head that recedes into a thin ring with a little lacing  S:lightly sour and tart notes with aromas of peaches and lemons. The finish has a clean, yeasty aroma with some bubblegum notes.  T: like the aroma, there are some sour notes and peach flavors at first along with some slightly musty flavors. The finish is very clean with some lightly sweet and bready notes.  M: light body with medium carb, this beer is light and crisp, which goes well with the flavors.  O: a pretty decent sour. Not strongly sour, but rather very clean with some lightly sour notes.
POSITIVE	A: Pours a hazy orange/copper color. A one finger white head forms, and recedes to leave some lace. S: Spicy and cinnamon aromas. Orange peal and some lemon zest. A citrus hop twang. Interesting is the word I would use to describe this. T: Again, interesting. Lots of spicy flavors. Some cinnamon and nuts. Soapy and oily citrus hops linger on. M/D: A medium body, crisp carbonation, and dry. Easy and smooth to drink. I can session this without a problem.  There are lots of layers here. They don't all mesh right for me though. The cinnamon and hop flavors are at odds for me. Not bad at all, and worth a try. I hope I can try this again sometime.
POSITIVE	Aecht Schlenkerla Rauchbier Mrzen  1 Pint .9oz Bottle into Balloon Tulip  Pours a deep dark brown with some ruby highlights around the sides of the glass. Khaki colored head nearly rises over the edge of the glass before it settles down. Tons of great sticky lace--great looking beer.  Heavenly sweet smokiness. The same smokiness found in the best baked hams, smoke cured bacon and smoked gouda cheese. The base beer imparts a sweetness from some caramel malt, I'm sure, but the smell is pure smoke.  The flavor is equally as impressive with the same sweet smokiness washing all of my taste-buds in a wave of taste. The sweetness of the base beer does something to balance the smokiness, enhancing it. Plenty of caramel malt flavor incorporates well to produce an overall masterpiece of a beer.  This is Schlenkerla's best in my opinion. The smokiness is perfectly complimented by the Mrzen style. This is probably the best Rauchbier I've ever had and by far the best Mrzen. I had this one before dinner, but next time I'm definitely getting some barbecue.
POSITIVE	I'll save the detailed A/S/T/M/D descriptions for the experts. Others describe beers so much better than I do. I'm an average hard-working American whose Monday through Friday beer is Genesee Cream Ale (just one or two after I come home from work at 11:30 pm). On the weekends, I have two or three decent beers that I can fit within my budget. Here's my review of this beer:  Bought from Warehouse Beverage in a 22 oz. bomber. Poured into a Guinness pint glass.  Wow, this is probably the best beer I have ever had in my life! Looked like motor-oil. Very thin tan head. Not much carbonation. Unbelievable aromas of vanilla, chocolate, and coffee. EXTREMELY drinkable. Flavors matched the aromas I described above! Amazing that you don't taste the alcohol considering it's 9.4% ABV! The ONLY downside is that it was $13.99. But I guess you get what you pay for. Can't recommend this one highly enough!
NEGATIVE	Clear dark orange with a smallish white bubbly head that leaves a light coating of lace. Sweet and fruity with light notes of honey. Some bready malts were in the aroma as well. Flavor was similar with the sweet fruit and honey over doughy malts. Very light hoppiness. Pretty thick body, almost too much so for this beer. Easy drinking enough I finished the bottle without problems but I dont know if I would come back for seconds.
POSITIVE	English Pale Ale from Mexico? I guess I'm being unfair, but the words "Mexican beer" usually imply some weak, fizzy skunky beer with a lime in it just to give it flavor. So when I saw this in my local dive liquor store, I decided to pick one up. And there's a good reason why I check out my local dive liquor store from time to time.  Looked real good in my tulip glass, with a nice bronze color and a light tan and fluffy head. Lots of lacing sticking to the glass. A bit of a musty, malty aroma with a little bit of pine to it. Flavor is malty, with some sweetness with a good amount of grapefruity hops, with some piney notes thrown it. A little bit of a resiny aftertaste, but a good heft and slightly creamy mouthfeel. Let it warm up a little bit, and the malt and hops will come to balance and be quite drinkable. Another reason NAFTA wasn't such a bad idea.  Next thing you know, a bunch of Brits will be trying to push some sort of pale, fizzy stuff with a lime on me.
POSITIVE	Had this on-tap at Capone's. Served in a 9oz. snifter.  Pure black in color. No light or any ruby red color around the edges. Pretty close to no head at all. Even as the glass emptied a few swills produced no head. No lacing present either.  Smell is beautiful. Lots of Bourbon, lots of dark roasted malts. Chocolate like and coffee. And you can definitely smell the maple and oak.  Right off the bat you get the Bourbon flavor. It makes its presence known but not in a hot alcohol way. Lots of chocolate and a touch of coffee in there too. You can taste the oak and dried raisin like flavors. The maple is very present and on the finish a huge amount of sweetness hits you. At first it seems almost too sweet but as the beer warms it mellows and becomes quite nice.  Mouthfeel is definitely full bodied. This one is thick and coats the entire mouth. The large amount of sweetness takes a little away from the overall mouthfeel.  Drinkabilty is good. With all the flavors and the high alcohol i could probably only drink maybe 2 of these 9oz glasses. Thats doesn't mean its not a great beer. Just a bit heavy.  Overall Founders does an excellent job once again. There isn't too much that they're doing wrong these days in my opinion and that why they're one of my favorite breweries. Try this one if you ever see it!
POSITIVE	Founders Backwoods Bastard pours up with a modest carbonation that creates a low, thin creamy tannish-white colored head that just rings the slightly hazy, deep chestnut brown-dark ruby body. The aroma is quite rich with a sweet caramel character that shows hints of burnt molasses, buttery toffee & treacle candy with underlying notes of biscuits & baker's chocolate. As the beer warms, the bourbon notes (charred wood, cherry, leather, smoke, vanilla, etc...) become more apparent. The flavor starts off rather bold with a solid kettle caramelized sweetness that's offset quickly by a blast of bitterness followed by some roastiness that combines to offer a bittersweet, bourbon laced finish that is quite deceiving. This is a great little, Wee-beasty from those Backwoods Bastards in Grand Rapids!   SLAINTE! Beertracker   *Trader's Note: Many thanks to hoppymeal for this one.
POSITIVE	A: One cm head, with a light golden colour. Very carbonated.  S: Very malty smell, but really not much smell to it.  T: This is very malty with a not any hops. Pretty bland flavour, just some malts and carbonation. It has the standard lager taste, but it's not in your face. Pretty okay.  M: Light and almost water like.  D: Not filling and the taste is bland but not bad so one can drink quite a lot.
NEGATIVE	Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a black color with a very small head. Smell is of coffee, roasted malts. Taste is also coffee up front, some malts, a bit of oats, just a touch of alcohol. Feels full bodied in the mouth and overall is a good quality beer.
NEGATIVE	Poured into a tulip. It pours a dark opaque, motor oil like viscosity. Caramel like head, with nice heavy lacing on the side of the glass.  Intial smell of coffee. Tobacco undertones. Chocolate is subdued, but there. Just the smell alone is enough to get you excited.  Tastes of roasted coffee. Slight tobacco on the back end. Bitter metallic presence, but not that overpowering. Dark bitter chocolate on the sides.   Nice consistent mouthfeel. Not as thick as other stouts, but very clean finish.  I love it better than the kentucky breakfast.
POSITIVE	Drank this straight from the bottle, chilled. A great tasting beer for a reasonable price. Czech lager at its best, nothing too fancy, sweet taste with a metallic aftertaste.  Easily drinkable, can see myself having a couple of this at one sitting. This is my first review so be easy on me.
POSITIVE	A: Big white fluffy head. Pale, cloudy, dirty yellow color  S: Big time peach smell. Overwhelms everythng else, but I like it.   T: Compared to the smell, the taste is quite lite. The beer balances the wheat flavor profiles with the peach flavor. Flavor lingered for a long time in my mouth.   M: Big time carbonation. Its clean and crisp but not alot unlike many beers of this style.  D: A great summer beer. I actually enjoy the fact that the beer isn't overwhelmed with peach flavor. You still get a nice wheat beer taste. This is a great beer for the season it is brewed for. I would purchase again.
POSITIVE	Picked this up on a trip to Philly last year.  Poured from a 12oz. bottle.  Appearance: Very black body, even under the light there is not but blackness. Nice healthy foam the color of dark chocolate milk. Thick and lasts an average amount of time.  Smell: Wow, if i thought others smelled like coffee, this one is in a class of its own. Strong, pleasant coffee mixed with oats and chocolate. Insistent and great.  Taste: Hate to say the old clich but it tastes like it smells with maybe the intensity dialed down a bit. Chocolate oats, reminiscent of a cross between oatmeal, cocoa chocolate bars and corn flakes. Yeah, there's some coffee also in there :)  Mouthfeel: Very smooth, carbonation a bit higher than i would have liked but still quite pleasant.  Overall: An excellent stout. Lacked a bit of fullness i found in the body but otherwise a very good pick.
NEGATIVE	Appearance: 1/4 inch head, cloudy, orange-brown in color  Smell: earth, caramel, and toasted malt  Taste: earth, caramel, chocolate, and toasted malt  Mouthfeel: medium/heavy bodied, semi-sweet, moderate carbonation  Drinkability: An average to just above Scotch Ale. Not one i would turn down, but nothing to rush and get. It meets all the style guidelines, but there just appears to be something missing.
POSITIVE	from City Beer Store in S.F. Poured a rich dark brown in a weizen glass with a nice light tan head. Good lacing too. Smell was very reminiscent of salted and peppered beef jerky and smoked bbq, and although it was very obvious, it wasn't as extremely overpowering or offensive as I feared. I found it extremely enticing and the taste was not a letdown either. The base of the beer itself was smooth, perfectly malty and sweet with a touch of lingering smokiness and light bitterness in the finish. It was very full flavored, not overdone and perfectly crisp from the carbonation, and I was shocked at how drinkable this stuff was. I expected this to be a letdown b/c I was quite excited to try it, but I was very pleasantly surprised. Very good, and I can't wait to try the other 2 varieties.
POSITIVE	Bought a 22oz. from the Market of Choice, and drank from a New Belgium snifter glass.   Color is black with a very tan/hazelnut not so foamy head.   There is a faint coffee aroma. There isn't a deep alchol smell, and it def. doesn't smell hoppy.  Taste was malty, oatmeal, and what at first tasted like licorice. chocolate is very present in the beer as well. Very drinkable, especially while watching Hockey.  I enjoyed drinking this with a pepperoni pizza.
POSITIVE	Served on-tap in a clear pint glass.   A: Appetizing reddish-amber hue with 1-finger off-white head and sheeting lacing.  S: Spicy, floral hops aroma is fresher and accentuated in the on-tap version compared to bottle. Malting is still significant and does its job.  T: Much more noticeable hops presence on-tap with spicy, floral C-type hops taking center stage but matched nicely with big-time malting, mainly with pale malt but with some caramel and crystal in there too.  M: Smooth and mouthfilling once warmed. Low carbonation and reasonably clean mouthfeel with nice floral hops aftertaste.  D: A really good IPA that is even better on-tap.
POSITIVE	Love Buzz, on tap from cask at the source, in a pint shaker glass.   When I ordered, the server let me know that this is a "cask ale", meaning it's served at a warmer temperature, and with less carbonation.  Looks jet black, to very dark brown at the edges. Nice half inch head of light brown, very fine foam, like silk.   Aroma is loaded with coffee, balanced with plenty of chocolate maltiness. Not a lot of roastiness, struck me as more of a coffee porter than coffee stout by the nose.  Flavor is spot on, a nice bit of roastiness, some chocolate, caramel, and loads of strong espresso.   Mouthfeel is perfect for the style, smooth without artificial slickness, nice, fine carbonation, notably bitter coffee finish as opposed to hops bitterness or roast malt bitterness. With good reason it's got Buzz in the name.  Overall this is a real fabulous beer. The server came by later, asked me how the cask beer tasted, I said flat and warm--give me another!!!!   (Not really flat at all, BTW, lovely carbonation perfectly balanced.)
POSITIVE	22oz bottle poured into a tulip pint  Pours a viscous midnight black. Absolutely no light gets through Boris. A brown, one finger head rose and subsided on the quicker side. Dots and scattered lines of lace leave their mark.  Dark fruits really cut through everything. Roasted malt, espresso, bittersweet Belgian chocolate, booze, and flaky oats have their place, but the fruits really ring the loudest.   Wow. Flavor is like a dark cherry dipped in bittersweet chocolate and dropped in an espresso. A touch of hop bitterness and a lingering boozy chocolate--cherry flavor. Rich and indulgent. There is almost a whiskey-like flavor hidden in there that really builds over time.  A big thick body on this guy. Velvety smooth. This might be as perfect as it gets. Coats the mouth and leaves a good amount of heat in its wake.  The thickness, booze, and rich chocolate and cherry really make you put the brakes on. This is one to sip and enjoy. With that in mind, this guy is exactly what you are looking for.
POSITIVE	When I visited Prague for a summer lo these many moons ago, I was warned by locals to stay away from tourist havens like Vclavsk nm&#283;st, where they sold marked-up Urqell for 2 bucks a pop, and check out the side streets, where other fine Czech pivo could be found for more reasonable prices. As a student, 50 cent half-litres of incredibly good beer that I'd never heard of made a whole lot more sense. But I always wondered if I was giving Urquell short shrift because of that experience.  This beer pours a clear, medium pale golden colour, with an inch of puffy white head, that leaves minor webbed lacing around the glass. It smells of white grainy malt and floral hops. The taste is grassy, somewhat acrid, floral hops, and grainy malt. There is moderate carbonation, a decently structured body, and a clean, offdry, cracker-like finish. Not my favorite Czech pilsner, but a good example, given its ubiquity at finer tourist traps everywhere.
NEGATIVE	Poured into a standard pint glass. Pours a see-through brownish ruby red. The head goes away eventually, but a thin film of light cream colored bubbles sits there for a while. No lacing. This beer smells like cherry cordials. It also smells a bit boozy and alcoholic. The beer tastes very medicinal. Again, the booze appears, even at only 5.7%. Whoever said it tastes like a cherry tootsie roll is right, and once you get that thought in your mind, you are doomed. I suppose cherry cordial is much more elegant, but still ... The mouthfeel is light and watery. Overall, I've had 7.5% ABV beers that taste and smell less alcoholic than this one. It has a pungent sting to the smell and flavor that I do not like. It's a neat dessert beer, if you have ONE, once ... but otherwise, don't go for the sixer.
POSITIVE	Founders Bad Habit Quad 12 oz brown bottle 9.8% ABV Served in a La Binchoise tulip glass  Pours a hazy peach with chunky yeast sediment floating on the bottom of the glass. Mini white thin lace around the top of the beer.  Powerful nose with whiffs a spicy Belgian yeast flare, dark fruit and sweet malts.  Syrup flavors burst with a juicy fruit sweetness. Rich and flavorful malt presence. Hints of banana nut bread, peach nectar and ripe prunes with a funky yeast kick. Just a touch of bitterness from the hops, but much more emphasis on the complexity of flavors. The alcohol is very well hidden and surprising at 9.8% ABV.   Wow, Founders strikes again with a style not many American craft brewers attempt, nevermind succeed. I would have like to give this beer another year or two to age. Nevertheless, it was deliciously complex and enjoyable.   I paired this up with some havarti cheese and crackers. The result was magnificent and recommended.
POSITIVE	Poured a very seemingly black, though still semi-translucent, showing dark dark brown in the light. A nice tan head left good lacing. Smells are big on cocoa, with some coffee grounds and dark fruits thrown in. Starts off with a sweet honey taste before a smooth chocolate syrup coats the tongue. Hints of licorice and dark fruits arrive as the beer warms up, all with a nice creamy espresso finish. Medium-full in body, very smooth and creamy. A terrific stout by Stoudt's, good for a nice dessert beer, though one has to be careful with the higher ABV.
POSITIVE	Orange tinted amber body with a fluffy light tan head that leaves some decent looking lace behind on the glass. Caramel malt, toasted grain and piney hops make up the nose on this one. The flavor has a more subdued caramel maltiness than the nose led me to believe there would be. The flavors lean towards the hoppy end of the spectrum with a nice pine sap bitterness that lasts in the finish. Medium light bodied with a slick mouthfeel. A nice APA.
NEGATIVE	I saw this on sale at the local supermarket ($6 a sixpack down from $7.50) so I decided to try it out.  The labling is extremely plain. It pours a medium-dark, and rather opaque, reddish brown, and there isn't much in the way of head and lacing.  It smells sweet and a bit malty. There's a lot of the chocolate in the nose.  The taste is like watery chocolate covered cherries with hints of raisins, gingerbread, and beer. That's really the best way to describe it--the cherry and the chocolate come through more strongly than any of the actual "beer flavors." The mouthfeel is unfortunately thin, and the taste is pretty bland in general. Still, it's reasonably drinkable, and not altogether unpleasant. I probably won't buy it again, but I like the idea; I'd love to see a well done cherry chocolate beer.
NEGATIVE	Poured from a 12 oz. brown bottle with a twist-off cap.  Appearance was a very light copper with a full-finger whitish head that quickly fizzled away to pretty much nothing and left no lacing on the glass.  Smelled mostly of hops, with grassy, hay-like notes and a faint aroma of sweet toffee.  Body was rather thin. Not much up front, as the beer brought on a very watery flavor in the beginning, edging into bitter, herbal hop flavors and biscuit notes in the middle and back, with a finish that was somewhat long and sweet.  Overall, the beer lacks distinct balance, and is decidedly reminiscent of a pale American lager, with its watered-down flavor and faint, mostly bread-like notes and bitter, though not strong, hop flavors. These things combine to create a brew that I would not really care to drink more of.   The witty name of the brew drew me in, but it takes more than a name to bring me back for more.
POSITIVE	Dark, tawny brown color, mostly clear and brilliant but a good amount of yeast floats around. Thinnish tan head leaves a long-lasting haze on the surface. Good amount of active carbonation. Intense smoke aroma; meaty and earthy. Rich, robust malts create a slightly sweet odor. The flavor is not quite as smoky; instead of overpowering, the smoke complements a sweet and complex malt profile. Slight floral hop flavor with a nice balancing bitterness. Light to medium in body with a substantial yet airy mouthfeel. The intensity of the smoke aroma was a bit off-putting at first but the flavor of this one is a great mix of smokiness and malt sweetness, with just enough hop bitterness to balance it all out.
POSITIVE	750ml bottle poured into an Allagash stemmed glass. 2011 release - 9.2% alcohol (listing shows 12.3%)  A - Wow...this pours deep ruby, red wine red with an intense 2 finger cap of deep pink foam that slowly fizzes away down to the surface leaving a feeble amount of lacing on the glass. I have had a number of raspberry beers but I don't think I've seen anything as intensely ruby colored as this! Impressively pink!  S - Definitely no mistaking this as anything but a heavily fruited raspberry beer. Like opening a fresh picked tub of raspberries from the garden (alright - Chris and Carol's garden). Really smells just like fresh fruit - really not much else, but it doesn't seem lacking in anything either.  T - Flavor doesn't disappoint at all. As expected the raspberry presence is overwhelming and in your face up front. Sugary sweetness is a close companion but never seems overly sweet - the tartness of the fruit offsets this beautifully. I actually think I'm getting a bit of grapey fruitiness in there too at a lower, background level...not sure, but there is definitely some other fruitiness I'm getting that is lightly corrupting the raspberry goodness in here. Hops/malt...not really getting any - this is fruit all the way.  M - The fruit is intense along with its accompanying tartness that leaves the mouth watering and anticipating the next sip. Body is medium and juice-like, residual sugars beef this up quite a bit. Carbonation is ample, but not overpowering...crisp, sparkling and a bit tingly.  O - A very, very good fruit beer. I think this is a close second on my list of favorite raspberry beers behind New Glarus Raspberry Tart which is practically flawless. Glad I was able to obtain one of these...and it does hold up to the hype/demand pretty well...I have no regrets for the $18 I spent on this bottle, but after having this, I know that for half the price and a little bit of effort setting up a trade I can get all the Raspberry Tart I want and be even happier.
POSITIVE	A: A beautiful light amber brown. Very little head, but what is there is white and slowly dissipates to bubbles on the surface. Crystal clear, and very pretty.  S: Wow. Maple is right up front. Bourbon and oak follow with a cloying sweetness in the finish. Picking up a bit of alcohol as well.  T: Oh my. That is just lovely. Starts with oak and maple, then bourbon, vanilla and wheat. Not a lot of hops, but I don't think it's needed. This this is smooth, and graceful, without too much booze flavor.  M: Syrupy, and creamy smooth. Low carbonation, but appropriate for the style.  D: This is so smooth, and so complex. Simple put, this beer is great.
POSITIVE	Appearance: Pours a hazy amber color with an oh too massive head that eventually settles down; nice stickage, however  Smell: Sugar cookie malt with pronounced undertones of orange peel, cinnamon and nutmeg  Taste: Opens with an herbal malty character that adds the citrus peel, vanilla and holiday spices by mid-palate; after the swallow, the holiday spice character dominates the finish, though there is a bit of bitter hop balance, too  Mouthfeel: Medium body with moderate carbonation  Drinkability: As the label says, this is a hoppy holiday ale - it has all of the winter warmer characteristics and is hoppy to boot - Ho Ho  Thanks, wagenvolks, for the opportunity
POSITIVE	12oz bottle picked up at the Herot in Muncie. Served in a Pint glass. I haven't had this beer in a few years, so looking forward to revisiting it.  A: Pours an oily black/brown. Very thin, brown head that dissipates quickly. TONS of sediment. It's like somebody poured a bunch of cracked pepper into my glass.   S: Big dark fruits and candied sugar. Almost smells like a good Belgian Strong Dark ale. There's a little bit of roasted malts and some faint dark chocolate. Yummy.  T: Roasty malts with some coffee and chocolate thrown in the mix. Almost Porter-like. There's some faint hop remnants left on the finish, and also some dark fruit characteristics that were prevalent in the smell. Also a small amount of alcohol is noticeable.  M: Thin, but borderline medium bodied. The carbonation is amazing on this. Time has been kind to it thanks to some oxidation.  D: Amazingly good. If I hadn't been writing this review at the same time, the glass would have been gone in minutes.  I believe Founders last brewed this "black beauty" over 2 years ago. So that means the bottle I was drinking was at LEAST that old, and I'm betting closer to 3 years or more. Regardless, age has changed Black Rye into another beast, or should I say another TASTY beast. I'd love to see Founders get back to brewing this. There's a lot of people out there that should have the opportunity to try it!
POSITIVE	12oz bottle, from Capone's (Norristown, PA). Pours clear golden, capped with a large, frothy white head. Crisp grapefruit hop aroma, with some grassy notes, and a minimal amount of malt in the background. Flavor begins with caramel malt for an instant, then grapefruity and earthy hops hit the palate. The hops are not overly aggressive, and stick around for a lengthy finish. Decent example of the style.
POSITIVE	Pours a murky brown color with a dense tan head that left quite a cap. The aroma is of liquid smoke, roasted meat, and a touch of wheat malt. The taste is heavy on smoke but unlike the Marzen, the wheat malt cuts the smoke just a bit. No real wheat flavors come about but there is a silkiness to the brew. Like the Marzen, the feel is a bit thin to support the smokiness but the wheat does a better job balances it out. There is good carbonation and the finish is dry. A good smokey brew, not very malty but the wheat does a good job balancing out this bad boy. Quite interesting.
NEGATIVE	First off this was listed at my Liquor Store as being a pale ale and said nothing about cream ale which I have had bad experiences with. It poured a golden wheat colored with a thin tan head and not much of an aroma to speak of. Its easy to drink but the taste is odd to me with a bitter aftertastes and a hint of something metallic maybe? I probably wont buy this product again but it could be a great beer to someone that appreciates the cream ale style. Cost: 6.99 to fill up my growler.
POSITIVE	Purchased as a single from Wine and Beer Westpark in Glen Allen, VA - poured into DFH snifter.  Pours a deep amber orange with dense head and great lacing. Smells.. like.. wow.. really? Weed. No joke. This beer smells like dank weed. It's dirty and funky but hoppy at the same time and it's just interesting!? Taste is nice and smooth for 12%.   Overall this is an awesome double IPA that you all should try.
POSITIVE	12 oz bottle purchased at Albertson's, Baker City, OR...  Appearance: pale orangey-brown, thinnish layer of white suds, OK head retention  Aroma: lush caramelly malt with the ubiquitous NW grapefruit hop aroma; hints of passion fruit, honey, and raisins  Flavor: dryish malt backbone with a hearty does of citrusy hop greenery; finishes dry with a firm grapefruit rind bitterness at the back of the tongue  Mouthfeel: medium body, crisp texture, gentle carbonation, slight astringency  Other comments: My first review of this beer was based on a draft sample, so I thought I review the bottled version to see how it fared. Still a great beer, though slightly muted in comparison.
NEGATIVE	This past Friday night I did a blind tasting of brown ales with my wife, because I figured it was time for me to re-evaluate a style I don't think much of. We each poured samples for the other, noted what was what and then brought out the beers, so while we couldn't taste the same beer at the same time, we were both able to taste without bringing any bias to the table.  Riggwelter is a seasonal beer that turns up at the LCBO every once in a while. I've had it before and never understood the fuss about it.  Fairly standard brown ale appearance. The brown is exactly in the middle of all the shades I see, and it produces a cream coloured head which gradually fades to a film. The aroma is subdued but pleasant enough, runnning the malty gamut, with hints of bread, caramel and nut. It would be good, but its too subdued, even at warmer temperatures. I also found the flavours to be tame, although they did gradually improve as the beer warmed. There's a fair bit of toast, along with caramel and faint coffee notes. The palate is fine, smooth and medium-bodied, with a lightly bitter finish.  When I discovered that this was the Riggwelter I wasn't surprised - its pretty average both as a beer and a representative of its style. There's just too little of interest going on to justify purchasing it again.
NEGATIVE	Poured into Sam Adams glass.  Appearance - cloudy golden yellow, half finger head quickly fades, alive and inviting, tons of carbonation, on first glance looks almost like a hefe.  Smell - nice hop/citrus aroma. Floral hops, piney/earthy/semi-sweet smell. maybe even some grapes.  Taste - decent hop taste, very dry finish. not much flavor in this one.  Mouthfeel - watery/thin, plenty of carbonation, yet somehow dull feeling.  Drinkability - not impressed! I usually enjoy founders very much, but this lacked any taste, flavor, and complexity their beers usually contain. Next time I would pass on this beer. It looked good to start, but it was all downhill from there.
POSITIVE	Bottle (2011)  Thanks for sharing, Kgristoff! Thanks for sharing, NoSignsOfPain!  Black on black with a thick, persistent brown head. This beer looks thick and heavy.  Powerful aroma of coffee, roasted malts, and some mild chocolate. I was actually expecting far more chocolate as the bottle describes this is as a "double chocolate...stout," but that's not to say I'm disappointed in the slightest with this aroma. It's wonderful.   The coffee flavors and delicious roasted malts present again and the chocolate is far more accessible in the flavor than the aroma. This stout is creamy, rich, slightly bitter, full of coffee, and rich melting chocolate. Divine.  Medium to thick bodied. Hearty.  An incredible coffee (chocolate) stout. Not to mention, it went great with breakfast!
POSITIVE	Had this courtesy of ChuggyMcBeer, mbudner, and TempsPerdu - much obliged!  Pours black with dark brown highlights and a one-finger brown head. The head slowly recedes into a thin pancake on top leaving solid lacing.  Smells of molasses and roasted malts with hints of vanilla and bourbon. Not nearly as sweet as the normal BORIS.  Tastes similar to how it smells. Equal parts roasted malts and molasses give way smooth vanilla flavors with hints of chocolate and fainter hints of bourbon. The barrel-aging doesn't add a whole lot to the flavor profile, but it mellows everything out.  Mouthfeel is great. Great thickness with sneaky carbonation. I had an 07 Abyss after this and the Abyss actual felt a bit on the thin side comparatively.  Drinkability is good. This goes down very easily, and it would be no problem to finish off a bomber or two.  Overall I much prefer the BA version to the normal BORIS - the flavors mellow out and the sweetness is taken down a notch. Definitely give this one a shot.
NEGATIVE	Presentation: It was poured from a brown 1 pint 0.9oz bottle into a pint glass. The label has no freshness date but it does have the abv (5.1%) and a description of the beer on the back.    Appearance: The body has a deep copper body with clear reddish highlights. On top it has a tall, light tan head that makes spotty and slick lacing on the glass.    Smell: Its aroma is very smoky, like hardwood BBQ smoke, roasted malt and those imitation bacon bits that go on salads.    Taste/Palate: There is a deep smoky wood character with grainy malt with hints of bacon. It has some mild sweetness underneath that is balanced buy some light mineral (salty metallic) notes and leafy hop bitterness. The palate has a slightly slick smooth feel with a medium body and carbonation. It finishes with a slow deep smoky fade off the tongue.    Notes: Overall it's an interesting beer but its not one that I could see myself drinking much of.
POSITIVE	Purchased this in a twelve pack to protect the beer from the light. The beer pour with an inch white head that dissipated in a few moments. Color was a deep gold with an aroma of sweet malt. The taste was a dominated by a delicious, rich malty flavor balanced by soft hops. The hops pleasantly lingered in the aftertaste. Overall this was a wonderful beer, a real heavyweight! This is a pretty easy choice when the comparably priced beers at the store were Heinkein and Foster's.
POSITIVE	Pours a bright copper color with a pillowy white head that leaves a lasting lace down the glass.  Nice fruity hops smells in the nose along with some creamy biscuit malts aromas.  Nice floral/fruity bitterness to open up the flavor.  The taste then transitions into a smooth biscuity maltiness.  Smooth and refreshing on the tongue, this brew is very drinkable.  This seems to be somewhat of a hybrid between the APA and EPA styles but is very nice and very drinkable nonetheless.  A great brew for any weather.
POSITIVE	12oz received in my recent trade with aqsprint... huge thanks Jon. Poured into my Boulevard Smokestack goblet.  beautiful dark brown frothy head... the pour was also very pretty with a nice reverse cascade going on... brew is of course black.  aroma is rich coffee and a little bit of chocolate... doesn't smell overly burnt, which I like.. sooo good.  massive amount of coffee flavor helped out immensely by a smooth velvety mouthfeel.. a little acidic from the coffee but doesn't distract too much... creamy.. a little bit of sweetness ties it all together and more chocolate comes out as it nears room temperature... this brew is very very good. I know I've had it once before, but this is a sipper and one to savor... I've got to get some more.  Jon thanks a bunch, a proper trader for sure.  4.5's and worth it.
POSITIVE	Tulip glass.  Pours like a darkly roasted coffee. A finger and a half of dark tan foam, with decent lacing. Smells like roasted malts plus breakfast: coffee, creamy oatmeal, a tinge of chocolate. Chocolate is more prominent on the palate, with more coffee. Carbonation is medium, body is medium-light with some creaminess from the oatmeal, with the alcohol barely noticeable. Overall, a tasty everyday stout. My only beef with this is that the coffee taste has an uncanny resemblance to Folgers.
POSITIVE	A: clear amber, white head that dissipates relatively quickly S: beautiful bouquet with resonance of grapefruits and flowers T: hops dominate the taste; light spicing; fills mouth nicely M: body not too watery, not too syrupy; pretty much what you would expect in an IPA D: unlike many IPAs, invites re-drinking time and again
POSITIVE	deep russet color with a small tan head that fades quickly into nothing. An average looking porter.  Roasted malts with a nice smokey component that resembles smoked meats ham particularly. An underlying of chocolate and caramel.  Nice porter very well put together. Smoke compliments the roasted malt nicely and add depth to the finish and late mid palate. Chocolate and caramel swirlded on the middle. An almost peat smoke flavor. Not neary as much meaty smokiness as the nose would suggest. A little thin in mouthfeel but very drinkable.
POSITIVE	Pours to a dark redish amber with a thick creamy off white head that lasts for the whole drink. Leaves great lacing!  Can smell a good hops and rye aroma with maybe a lttle citrus.  This really tsted like a pale ale with a slight rye taste. There was a sweetness to also maybe a honey or citrus.  Has a medium thick body with a good carbonation. Kinda creamy.  This beer was delious.
POSITIVE	Poured 8oz. draft into a snifter glass at Founders Brewery.  (A)- Rich, thick lather-like 3 finger head that only dissipated until many many minutes. Completely opaque midnight brown color. Tons of lacing all over the place inside the glass.  (S)- Seriously rich aromas of maple syrup, root beer,vanilla, nutmeg/cinnamon, and cocoa components. Man, I could smell this all day!  (T)- Again, seriously rich maple syrup, cocoa, root beer, molasses, malted milk, coffee, and a interesting caramel taste on the finish. Bourbon hints as well. So complex and even sort of delicate considering how strong this is. The taste could linger in your mouth for minutes at a time without disappearing!   (M)- Smooth as silk, except for a slightly dusty cocoa texture component. At near 10% abv, I didnt believe it at first, but I certainly felt it later!  (D)- Its almost like sipping on a liquified maple syrup/mocha/caramel/chocolate malt shake! Incredibly rich & full-bodied, not to mention high in alcohol. A wonderful after dinner sipper. So many flavors and complexities to enjoy in this brew, i wish i could sit and contemplate it for more than the 10 minutes I had with it at the brewery! It really hits you hard though due to the abv, and how rich it is.
POSITIVE	The beer pours a yellow color with a white head. The aroma is a mix of bready malt with some grassy hops. A nice, clean smelling German lager. The flavor is mainly bready and biscuit malt with some grassy hops mixed in. I also get a little bit of light grape notes but they are pretty faint. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Another good beer from a great brewery.
POSITIVE	This one pours a rich red color. It's cloudy with a modest head that fades to leave a chronic ring around the edge and a patch of bubbles on top.   The nose oozes malted milk balls, cocoa, and dark rye bread. This isn't a half rye beer, this is a rye beer. The citrus tang from the hops is assertive and plays with the aforementioned flavors very politely. This is gonna be a heavy hitter.   The rye isn't quite up front and center, but it blends a spicy yet sweet malt character with a very assertive pine and grapefruit hop bill. The rye malt brings incredible warmth and balance to an already solid IPA. The finish is bitter and lingers long and obvious.   The body is on the medium side, and creamy from beginning to end. The carbonation is crisp and sharp, adding a little drama to an otherwise smooth feel.   Anyone looking for a solid IPA spiced up with a confident malt profile, give it a shot.
POSITIVE	I liked this beer!   Got it in a discovery pack at the lcbo.  Sharp bite like a tonic water that finishes with hoppy blast in face.  Hint of necture nut honey sweetness.  Pours giant head, goldie copper color, hazed with bit of sediment.  Sweet hoppy smell.  I would buy a full 6 pack of this beer.
POSITIVE	Received from via trade from jlindros. Much appreciated!  Appearance: Pours an opaque black with a very thin mocha brown head that dissipates quickly leaving a ring around the glass and not a lot of lacing.  Smell: Chocolate, oatmeal, toasted oats, and toasted malts predominate. The beer smells rich. The coffee and chocolates combine with hints of vanilla to create a very tantalizing smell.  Taste: Coffee and chocolate goodness right off the bat. Some hop bitterness on the back end. The middle is all toasted oats and grains, with some toffee, butterscotch, and vanilla mixed in for good measure. There's also slight alcohol taste, but the higher ABV combined with the sweet nose means this isn't too surprising.  Mouthfeel: Sweet, syrupy, sticky, smooth. The four S's! This beer coats the tongue and mouth, and permeates every corner with sweet chocolates and slightly bitter coffee flavors. There's a twinge of an aftertaste, but this beer finishes fairly clean for the style.  Drinkability: This beer straddles the line between drinkably sweet and overly sweet. The toasted grains and oats balance the sweetness nicely, and the hop addition helps as well. This is a quality beer, and I'm really glad I got the chance to try this hearty brew!
POSITIVE	Unbelievable, just drank back to back with PTE, Green Flash Imperial, Dark Horse Double crooked Tree, New Holland Mad Hatter Imperial, and Bells Hopslam and all four of us preferred the founders, especially for the price.  Great Aroma, Mouthfeel and taste. I wish this was a beer that easily cloneable.
POSITIVE	Growler  Pours a clear golden amber with a foamy light tan, nearly white head with lots of lacing.  Hops! Smells of pine hops with light roasted malts hanging around somewhere in there.  Certainly hoppy! Pine hops with a bit of citrus also present. Roasted malts are there, but hard to pick up.  Medium body with complimenting carbonation.  Quite a drinkable IPA that provides what an IPA should.
NEGATIVE	For the mass produced pilseners, this one isn't too bad. I enjoyed it well chilled in my classic pilsener glass. Poured a dark golden color with a fairly nice head. Smelled of slightly grassy hops and a touch of malt sweetness. Tasted of slight lemongrass with a mild sweetness upfront and then a Saaz hop drying finish.
NEGATIVE	12 oz bottle  A pale macro yellow with a fizzy white head and some streaky lacing.   Grain and straw in the nose, along with a familiar "imported beer" funkyness.   Toasted grain and wheat tendencies quickly disintegrate into metallic barley flavors. Swirls with mealy tastes before finishing fairly clean.   Lighter body, watery, quick, clean drinking, but definitely not pleasurable. It's not horrible for light beer, but if you consider the price, buying this is pretty much ludicrous.
POSITIVE	Pours a hazy dark orange color with a small white head.  Scent of piny, soapy, oily hops, strong citrus and a hint of caramel. Great scent, very hop forward.  Taste of piny soapy hops, citrus, perfume and some caramel. A tasty West Coast IIPA.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied with good carbonation.
POSITIVE	Had out of a bottle, in first btach from the CBC, thanks to Guy Bellino.  A - Deep burnt yellow with hints of orange as carbonation ascend up through the pilsner glass. Tight foam head, with little retention.  S - Rich and spicy, with mondo pumpkin and cinnamon aromas.  T - Extremely well balanced between nutmeg, cardamom, and cinnamon versus deep earthy malts, with a tinge of bitter hoppiness that cleans the palate. This last bit can't be overstated, because it separates this from lesser pumpkin ales that tend to cloy rather quickly.   M - Excellent whole-milk to HnH feel, with really surprising carbonation that keeps it fresh.   O- An exemplary Pumpkin Ale ... reach for this one if you can find it and want to ring in the early holidays with a festive flavor.
POSITIVE	Burnt coffee bean brown--black in all but the brightest light--with minimal highlights. This beer is a veritable light-sucking black hole. The dark caramel-colored head is mega creamy and deposits thick chunks of brown lace that form a thick, fat ring above the opaque liquid. Pike Street Stout looks like it means business.  The nose is of concentrated, chocolate liqueur-laced, melted dark chocolate. Black coffee and hops add depth. On the palate, the beer possesses a heavily roasted maltiness that results in a sweet, medium-heavy, creamy mouthfeel. In addition, a definite citric hoppiness adds a certain zesty zing. The result is a point-counterpoint of competing flavors that is pure pleasure.   Something is keeping me from awarding a 4.5 for taste, but it's extremely close. The body becomes less full on the finish--never dropping below medium--and the bitter citrus rind lasts long after the beer has gone. Carbonation and alcohol are barely evident.  Pike Street 5X Stout is another excellent stout from a largely unheralded U.S. craft brewery. It's too bad that the vast majority of these fine beers are unavailable to those of us in fly-over country. This one would be in my regular winter rotation if it was readily available in Iowa. Recommended.
POSITIVE	Only thing this brew suffers in is drinkability simply because it's so damn rich and loaded with coffee. Other than that, this is one fine ass brew....  Glugs out tee-totally black and smells like three day old coffee and loads of dark chocolate.   Loads of dark bitter chocolate and coffee with this one. It reminds me of one of those extreme chocolate bars where there is 80% cacao beans in it or something. Very dark and bitter.  Nice thick mouthfeel to this one as well.   Can't wait to try the Kentucky to compare how these two hold up...  An unbelievable beer..
POSITIVE	Bottle purchased at the Alvinne Craft Beer Festival bottle shop.   Body is a light amber. Poured to a half inch head, has good head retention and leaves lots of lacing.   Smells of light malts, and fruity, floral hops. Very aromatic. I am enjoying the smell of sweet malt and green floral hops. Has a very nice expression of wet hay. There is also some banana/tropical fruit from the belgian yeast.   Tastes of sweet malt, candi sugar, and aromatic hops. Nicely mellow with the hops, but more than one would expect from a belgian IPA.  Body is medium and the carbonation is enough to give this a delicious, creamy mouthfeel.   This beer is a very good Belgian IPA.
POSITIVE	A: Hazy copper/apricot in appearance  S: Very faint aromas of pine and grapefruit   T: More vibrant, citrus hop flavor than expected with such a faint aroma. Strong grapefruit tanginess throughout. Very easy to drink on a summer day!  Overall a great seasonal offering from CBC! I would like to see this one year round!
NEGATIVE	Poured into a Sam Adams perfect pint glass.  Appearance: one inch head, orange-gold in color, clear, high carbonation  Smell: nutmeg, pumpkin, and pumpkin spice  Taste: sweet caramel and bready start followed by pumpkin spice in the middle that continues to the end. There are slight hops in the finish.  Mouthfeel: sweet and spicy with slight bitterness at the end, moderate-high carbonation, medium bodied  Drinkability: This one falls in the middle of the pumpkin beers I have had this season. Above average, but I have had better. I would be really curious to have this on tap. Subtle, I would reach for others first, but would not pass this over if offered to me.
POSITIVE	12 oz. bottle into a pilsner.  pitch brown with a quarter inch of brown foam that dies quickly.  aroma is thick with roasted malts, sweet chocolate and burnt espresso.  heavy thick mouthfeel with just enough carbonation. sweet fudgy flavors balanced by a cleansing coffee-like bitterness. absolutely no hint of alcohol. incredibly rich aromas and flavors but it comes off as very balanced, smooth and drinkable.
POSITIVE	pours completely dark ,,,no light through it...solid middle finger worth of tannish head that dissapates to a halo around the glass...smells of dark mocha coffee and bourbon..wows..almost tickles the nostrils...the taste changes as the glass settles and warms..offering dark chocolate, coffee, roasted malts and fruits followed by that warm bourbon rush...leaves your mouth wanting more..probably a good thing this is so limited as i could see how this would be incredibly addicting!!
NEGATIVE	A - Pours a pretty dark, almost pitch black, with ruby highlights. Head fizzes up and falls quickly like a soda.  S - Fruity and roasty, with notes of molasses and cocoa.  T/M - Whoa. Dry. Strong, black coffee and a hint of hops in the finish. Very astringent. The actual body itself I would call medium.  D - Not the best I've had. Very in your face with a tannic? astringency and dryness that is very puckery. Kinda harsh.
NEGATIVE	Reviewed on 07/27/2009. Bottle. Pours a cloudy light orange with a small white head. Aroma of spices, clove, wheat. Flavor is quite similar with lots of spices, bubblegum, and wheat. Your typical hefe, but has too much spice presence. Overall decent.
NEGATIVE	12oz bottle poured into a pint glass  A: Pours a dark brownish color that appears more of a reddish-brown when held up to light. Thin head that dissapates within about a minute and leaves some nice lacing the whole time.  S: Wow, you can really smell the bourbon in this one. Also smells of oak, molassas and even some dark fruit in there such as raisin.  T: Mostly malty and nutty. The bourbon is very prevalent as well, a little more so than I really would like in the taste. A little boozy going down.  M: Medium to thick; creamy.  D: For the 10% ABV, this one goes down suprisingly easy. While it is definitely an excellent beer, I'm not sure if I could see myself drinking more than one of these in a night, the molasses gets a little tiring.
POSITIVE	Appearance - amber red in color, little head atop the body - it was tannish in color.  Smell - lots of hops! smells as if they were american hops too. some citrusy aromas are sensed here.  Taste - I can taste the rye in this with a good amount of hops. Hops were not overwhelming like in the smell.  Mouthfeel - very easy to drink. love it.  Drinkability - only have 1 six pack, but i am going to find more.
POSITIVE	A staple beer for anyone living in middle Tennessee. Dos Perros is a good beer which presented with very little head. Often this beer is sered too cold as it was last night at The Palm restaurant in downtown Nashville. Order it and let it sit a little and as it warms is choclate notes are more evident and it tastes better. An area this beer could be better is mouthfeel. A little too much carbonation at times. Try it if you get a chance - one of my favorite Yazoo beers..
POSITIVE	This one is about 1-2 years old.  A - Solid black wit ha small creamy mocha head. Spotty lacing left behind.  S - Dark roasted malts, milk chocolate, espresso. Some soy sauce notes present from the age but in a good way.  T - Roasted malt, espresso, dark chocolate, slight hoppy bitterness. Hints of tobacco and leather.  M - Full body, slick, a bit oily. A nice sipper.  D - Tasty
POSITIVE	Bottle acquired via trade with NJpadreFan Had for breakfast on 10/16/07 Looked good. Sticky black lacing on the glass. Very little light penetrating through Smelled good. A lot of coffee in the nose. LOTS of coffee. This beer reminded me a lot of the KBS which reminded me of a homebrew failure I made about a year ago. The coffee is just overpowering and then the bitter chocolate comes through and makes for a bit of a mess for me. Obviously I am not in the majority as this is, at time of review, #12 on BA's top 100. Mouthfeel is a bit thin for me, not watery, but with all these conflicting tastes in my mouth, I expected the malt to help balance a bit more, which for me means a thicker, maltier beer. This is a good beer and I am glad I have another bottle waiting for me, just doesn't live up to the hype for me
POSITIVE	Just didn't "get" this one. Not sure what they are going for. Looks good, smells ok, taste is uneventful with just a hint of bourbon.Mouthfeel is thin and is drinkable,but why? This is strictly minor leagues of the genre.This couldn't hold Bourbon County or Kentucky Breakfast Stouts jockstrap.I think that if a big macro wanted to attempt this style, this is what we would get.Not bad, but to think of this as a contender in this style,is beyond absurd.
NEGATIVE	A- dark reddish brown body with the smallest almost yellow head on it. somewhat sticky  S- intense grapefruit hops, a little bit of pine, and some caramelly malts.  T- sharp bitter citrus hops. lots of alcohol, but at 13% what do you expect? strong malty backbone. warms all the way down  M- very thick and syrupy. coats the mouth  D- too strong and bitter to want to have more than one of. a good choice to get a fast hop fix. reminded me of an american barleywine because of the color, mouthfeel, and strength.
POSITIVE	Poured into a pint glass.  4.0 A: Thick syrupy black. Two fingers of thick creamy medium brown head with good retention and moderate lacing. Definitely a looker.  4.5 S: Smells almost like straight up bootstrap molasses. Lots of roasted barley and caramelized malts. Oatmeal complements the other aromas well.  4.5 T: I haven't had many oatmeal stouts, but this is easily the best. Lots of roasted barley and toasty flavors. This has one of the most elegant flavor profiles for a stout that I've ever experienced. There are no off flavors: no fusels, no slightly sour flavor from the oats, no excessive burnt flavors. Oats complement the roasted flavors.  4.0 M: Smooth and creamy. Lower medium carbonation which works really well. Good, but not too impressive.  5.0 D: One hell of a brew. I could easily put down a few of these since it's really flavorful, but have no off flavors at all.
POSITIVE	Much thanks to CBA for this tasty brew.  The 12oz bottle opened with an incredibly loud bang. A very slow pour still produced a five finger whipped tan head overtop of a deep, opaque black body, that surprisingly allowed some light through the edges of the glass. Finely and mildly carbonated, after the initial burst had a chance to subside. Big and sticky clumps of lace formed fluffy little clouds that graced the inside of my beer glass.  Creamy oatmeal, treacle, black coffee, a slight metallic twang, hints of char, smoke, and milk chocolate greeted my nose.  Good stuff! Oatmeal creaminess is almost lost in the profound depths of roasted and charred flavours of coffee, anise, and flavours of milk chocolate. A touch of amaretto also managed to escape from the pronounced roastiness of this brew. A mild and earthy bitterness of decaying leaf gave way to a slight puff of smoke at the finish.  Full bodied, and a touch overcarbonated, especially initially. Smooth and almost velvety, although this effect was muted due to the active carbonation. Nice balance between creamy and charred grains. Coffee takes a backseat to the other flavours, but certainly lets its presence be known, much like the hops.  A big, tasty, and deeply flavourful brew. Some alcohol heat makes the 8.3abv apparent, but this is pretty damn drinkable for what it is. Highly recommended to fans of the style, may be too much for a newbie. Really has me looking forward to my bottle of KBS!
NEGATIVE	500 ml bottle from Lithuania  Pours golden with swarms of small carbonation bubbles and foamy light yellowish head that soon sags in the middle and later dense layer on the top remains, generous patchy lacing. Aroma is malty with hints of herbs.  Taste is alcohol malt, short glimpses of herbal hops and sharp bittery/sourish mild nutty aftertaste. Mouthfeel is medium with moderate carbonation.  Overall, slightly strange, but not in a good sense.
NEGATIVE	Pours a clean, clear gold with carbonation bubbles racing to the top. There's about an inch of frothy head with nice retention. In the nose the hops are noticeable as is the lager yeast; a little musty, but welcomed for the style. In the taste I notice grains and malt up front that add a little sweetness, but then the hops come through and add a decent amount of bitterness that really rounds this beer out nicely. There is just a hint of yeast in the aftertaste; very subtle. Mouthfeel is crisp, clean, smooth, and well carbonated.
POSITIVE	The Founders Devil Dancer holds true to its name. After one pint of this beer I was feeling good.   It poured a nice orangish-copper color. With a strong aroma of hops and also a sweet aroma of candy sugar the Devil was very appealing. The taste of piney hops and alcohol was most prevalent. It also had a slight bitterness to it, but it wasn't that prevalent to me.  This was a great American Double IPA and I highly recommend it .
POSITIVE	Pours a copper-orange with huge white head. Great head retention and lacing down the glass. Smell has citrus hops with lots of sweet caramel and nuttiness. Taste has lots of bitterness, but also very sweet. A very well balanced IPA. Great carbonation level. A friend of mine brought this back from a trip to Montreal just as an extra for me (based on the name I think) and I'm glad she did!
POSITIVE	Pours opaque amber/orange with a big foamy head that leaves tons of lacing.  Aroma of citrus and sweetness. Grapefruit hops dominate the taste, but are balanced nicely by a honey-like sweetness. Great bitter finish on the back of my tongue begs another swig. Not really a complex beer, just great tasting and well balanced. The advertised 65 IBUs seem quite conservative. More bitterness than Hop Stoopid's claimed 102 IBUs.  Medium mouth feel with moderate, refreshing carbonation. Super drinkability. Two or three of these in a sitting would definitely be doable. A very good IPA. Recommended for anyone who enjoys hoppy, bitter IPAs.
NEGATIVE	A: Cola brown, tan head, fades quick.  S: chocolate covered bacon.   T: Bourbon is upfront, but light, the smoke middle. Finsishes with little bitter chocolate.  M: Fairly thin. Greasy smoke sticks in the mouth.  D: OK, drinkablilty has no style for to judge it. First off, I'm not a big fan of Rauschbeirs, but, I though a Porter, aged on bourbon barrels, would ease some of the bacon out of it. It didn't. I struggled thru the glass, poured the rest. I did, howeverm attempt to judge it via the style. I studied the style prior to tasting ( not other reviews ), and then did the deed. i guess this is my last smoked beer ever, it just sets the gag reflex in motion. I can't help but wonder, and drool, over the possiblities of this without smoke.
POSITIVE	Pours black with an inch of mocha head. Fades to a collar that leaves nice lacing down the glass.  Smells like coffee, roast, caramel, and citrus/herbal hops.  Taste follows smell, a lot of coffee in the begining giving way to a rush of caramel and roasted flavors. Its really a beautiful thing.  Mouthfeel is nice and full, little low on carbonation for me, but its sticky, oily, and full.  Drinkability is good. I'm not usually one to have 2 of the same beers in 1 night, but this is one I could.
POSITIVE	A - The beer pours a rich, deep copper color with brown highlights. A very large pillow-like head forms and the retention is quite good. As I work through this beer, I notice the lacing is massive. Huge soap-like presence decorating the entire glass. Carbonation is relatively high. So far, so good, this is exactly what I want my rye beer to look like.  S - This is definitely different than I expected. There is a heavy aroma of citrus fruits and candy. The hops are also very present and add a very earthy almost piney smell. I was not able to detect the rye in the nose. This smells more along the lines of a double IPA.   T - The first thing I tasted was a nice hint of caramel malt followed by some bitter citrus, possibly grapefruit. The rye is present and adds a complexity to the flavor. There is a slight hop bitterness in the clean and dry finish. There is a very small hint of alcohol in the finish and this increases as the beer warms.   This is a very nice offering from Founders. A good mix of sweetness and bitterness with a dash of rye mixed in. It is light bodied and somewhat less creamy than I would have expected. I would say this is a very sessionable beer and at 6.8% abv. I could get into some trouble.
POSITIVE	The Elora Irish Ale came bundled up with five other brews in a mixed six pack aimed at promoting Ontario breweries to the local market. The inclusion of a Trafalgar brew on the list concerned me a little because at best I've found them to be lacklustre and at worse sour and infected.  Putting all prejudices aside, I'm ready for this one. The pour reveals a cola coloured body bordering on ruby and mahogany, along with an eggshell white film, which laces a little before fading completely halfway through drinking.  The aroma blows me away. Its not a perfect 5, but it does smell fantastic, and not at all what I expected. There's a fine mix of fruit, mostly apple and citrus, but its well paired with some good floral hopping, which helps to add an additional element and prevent it from becoming one dimensional.  The first thing I notice in the taste is that this actually has hops in (I can't remember the last time I tasted hops in a Trafalgar brew). The surprising bitterness helps to offset the malty flavours, which find themselves embodied in fruit and caramel. The whole blend makes it very easy to drink, and it doesn't have the cloying sweetness I've found to be a hallmark of this brewery.  The carbonation is well-done, and apparent, which again amazed me. The body is light, edging to medium, but really its the carbonation that's well handled, and it works well with the bitterness of this drink.  Overall, a surprise winner, and not one that I expected. Everything that they have traditionally done wrong has been righted here, and it shows me the promise this brewery can have if they get their shit together.
POSITIVE	Poured from a growler into multiple pint glasses. Extra special thanks to Matt for sharing, and thanks to Matt, Joe, and Wil for the assist!  Also stopped by Haymarket on 3/15/11 with pops and had a 4oz pour.  A: Pours a bright peachy orange with agitated hazy clarity. Large, light orange head built up quickly on top before settling down to a thin wafer and a little lace.  S: Crazy good aroma! Gobs of fresh apricot and mango. Juicy Fruit and/or Fruit Stripe gum, pineapple, and super ripe juicer oranges.  T: There is some malt in there, lurking, but it acts to showcase the tropical fruit explosion. As it warmed I picked up more and more sweet citrus flavors (oranges, clementines, tangerines).  M: Huge, sticky, and sweet! The alcohol is pretty well hidden, but I could feel the hops etching into the enamel on my teeth.  D: So big and sweet it almost made me forget all about the 10%...almost. It was quite apparent by the end of the glass, though.
POSITIVE	Fresh 2009 vintage from a stubby brown twist-off bottle.  Pours black as black as black. Totally opaque, no highlights or edges. Creamy 1" khaki head. Ominous and unmoving. Small dots of lace.  Smells of cocoa powder, malted milk (actually similar to Whoppers candy) a touch of vanilla and dark roasted malts galore. After a few swirls of my glass, a faint alcohol whiff is detected. The roasted malts and deeeep chocolate permeate my nostrils.  Whoa...intense roasted malts coupled with a nice hoppy counterbalance give this stout some major traction. The malted milk & chocolate I detected in the smell translate into dark bitter, chalky baker's chocolate of the 80% cocoa variety. The hops play a big party in the chalky dry element to this stout. The neck label reads 90 IBU's - so there's some major hop action happening to keep this massive stout from becoming too sweet and cloying. The alcohol is pretty well masked as well.  Mouthfeel is not as thick & oily as I would have guessed. It's a touch thin as the carbonation is fine but fleeting. Heavy-full bodied for sure but not a lot of finesse on the tongue.  Drinkability is good because of the slightly 'watery' mouthfeel, meaning it doesn't seem to engulf your entire palate because there's a bit of ease in the swallow.   Overall a very well made and hugely flavorful RIS. The dry/chalky elements of this highly hopped stout really make it stand out. Too many huge RIS' are too sweet, but this one manages to get the malt barrage in tact while giving the hops some of the spotlight also. Very, very flavorful and surprisingly easy to drink.
NEGATIVE	Picked up at my source for Polish beer in South Boston.  Packaging, with flames and a phoenix definitely draws the eye.   Appearance is dark, with decent head.  Aroma is sweet, with a musky hop backbone.   Taste is reflective of the aroma. Sweet, and earthy hops balances nicely.  Gets a bit watery and thin in the finish.  Very tasty, not as good as the original Okocim porter.
POSITIVE	Poured into a pint glass  A: Moderate pour yields 1/2 finger of dark brown head with good retention. Opaque dark brown/black liquid. Pretty darn ideal.  S: Licorice, roast, chocolate, vanilla. A bit mild though.  T: Coffee, green banana, bittersweet chocolate. Very tasty with a nice sweet entrance. Not quite as smooth or sweet as Breakfast Stout, but excellent still. Some booziness is held in check.  M: Bitterness from grain and hop. A bit of warmth is just enough.  D: Great. I'd order another and buy again.
NEGATIVE	12oz bottle served in a shaker pint. Poured a brilliant gold with less than a finger of white head. Massive piney hop aroma, almost too "green". Some bready malt in the aroma as it warms. Big hop profile in the flavor. Bursting with hop presence. More pine along with citrus. A bit vegetal however. Very drying hop finish. Lighter side of medium bodied. If you are looking for a blast of fresh hop flavor, this is your beer.
NEGATIVE	Bottle poured into Duvel tulip.  A- Pours a deep black with minimal head. Small lacing left from the head receding.  S- This brew is loaded with roasted malts and dark chocolate. There is a slight hoppiness in there and some cocoa powder.  T- Cocoa powder and roasted malts with a slight soapiness. There is a faint hoppy taste and a small bready character.  M- Medium to full bodied with pretty good carbonation. Regardless of the carbonation, the brew seems pretty smooth.  O- Pretty good beer all around. Not one flavor dominates and all seem to go good with each other. It just seems like it could have been a little stronger all around.
NEGATIVE	Light gold color, medium white foamy head. Aroma is malty and slightly sweet. A mild tasting wheat beer. Some banana and clove taste. Mild malts and some hoppyness. Smooth taste. Mouthfeel is a little thin. Finish is clean. Aftertaste is slightly sweet.
POSITIVE	Poured into my mug out of a green bottle. Why green??? I dumped it out of the bottle with a quick pour but it created no head. Color is a sparkling clear straw.   Smell was dominated by that oh so typical green bottle skunk. I can't really get past it to detect anything else.   Taste is initially of slightly sweet malt. It is followed by a moderate yet pleasant hop bitterness.   This beer has a watery mouthfeel. I don't think this is a bad thing for the style. Carbonation is strong and it leaves a nice tingling on the tongue that leaves my mouth feeling clean. This is an extremely drinkable pilsner.   Overall this beer is okay. I think if it were in a brown bottle or a can it would be much better. This brew is crisp and refreshing. I wouldn't mind having it at a BBQ or a baseball game on a July afternoon.
NEGATIVE	A - Light clear yellow with a moderate white head that disappeared pretty fast.  S - Not much, Some malt/grain sweetness and a bit of mineral.  T - Not a lot. Mostly grainy (corn) sweetness and a bit of mineral taste. Maybe slight hops at the end.  M - Light body with decent carbonation. What you would expect from a mass produced/consumed beer.  D - Like other similar beers, easy to drink but with the flavor why would you really want to?  Notes: Like others in the style, this one doesn't really have anything to set it apart though. Not really all that much worse or better than other beers like it. So if you are in a situation that you want this kind of beer or that is all you can get, feel free to try it, but don't expect a lot.
POSITIVE	12 oz bottle into a tulip glass. Allowed to warm at room temperature for about 20 mins before opening.  Pours a clear golden color with a couple fingers of puffy white head that quickly fades to a thin layer leaving some sticky lacing behind on the sides of the glass. A steady stream of bubbles can be seen feeding that thin layer. Not really as dark as I was expecting from a DIPA.  The aroma is mostly piney hops with a dose of sweet malt in the background. The malt is more pronounced than I would have expected based strictly on the color.  In the taste I get a bitter pine tar flavor, but in a good way and some hints of citrus and a pretty decent alcohol burn in the finish.  The mouthfeel is rather thick and viscous with just the right amount of stickiness. Carbonation is just a bit on the heavy side, but it work swell. This is definitely a potent DIPA, but it's good and unique, which will make it memorable and I'd try it again if the opportunity presented itself.
POSITIVE	This is the first yorkshire ale I have ever drank, so take my review with a grain of salt. The smell was good, but it almost smelled like a porter, which from the reviews I have read thats about what to expect. The taste was a strong but not overpowering of mault. Overall a very drinkable ale, just not quite as strong or think as a porter, but I think I would have been confused if not for knowing what it was when I bought it. I'll have to drink more to get a better idea of what it should be. Nice drinkability though.
POSITIVE	Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a tulip glass.  A: Opaque black color with a quickly diminishing residue of beige foam. Light lacing remains on the glass.  S: At its coldest this beer smells overwhelmingly of coffee, like freshly ground beans. As it warms it develops deeper, more mocha-leaning qualities that suggest unctuousness. No alcohol is detected.  T: Begins off-dry, with early roasted malt that is slightly bitter and astringent. When combined with the coffee nose, the qualities of coffee are maintained here. Acidity is present but does not detract, remaining at an acceptable level. The middle displays a woody chicory quality, some mild cocoa, and cardboard. Honest coffee aromatics are abundant in the finish, where bitterness is closely tied to the coffee qualities, rather than possessing the herbaceous qualities indicative of hops. No alcohol is detected.  M: Medium to thick viscosity, slightly syrupy without being cloying, with moderate carbonation.  D/O: This double stout seems to have all the bases covered, but like its peers that also occupy the range of 8-9% abv, it would be so much more impressive if it were not as strong. Hops are apparently not for breakfast, leaving this beer to gather its aromatic qualities almost entirely from the coffee that is quite bold in its sensory profile. It is able to be more than just a one-note coffee bomb, even though coffee is the single most intense quality present. Oddly, there is too much cardboard present for a strong stout that is this fresh. Despite the heavy coffee presence and other minor question marks, this beer is easy to consume while staying interesting from start to finish.
NEGATIVE	Clear, pale colour in a clear bottle (bad!). Malty middle with a sour aftertaste. Medium-high carbonation. Elements of crackers, red wine, and woody notes. Thought something might be a little off during this tasting; confirmed when bottles not too much later were obviously very off.  A good idea, but please use brown bottles next time!
NEGATIVE	Appearance: cloudy orange color with a short one finger head that falls apart immediately.   Smell: fruity sweetness, caramel, and some alchohol.  Taste: malt and fruit sweetness abounds, along with some honey, caramel, and alcohol. Bitterness tries to bring it back in check but falls a bit short.  Mouthfeel: medioum bodied. Smooth from start to finish. Long alcohol fueled aftertaste.   Drinkability: a decent beer but alcohol is a bit too up front here. Worth a try.
POSITIVE	Part of my beer of the month club delivery, this beer is in a brown bottle with a really cute label with some eastern european artwork on it. And surprisingly, O.K. Beer is more than just that! Pours a very clear, although solid looking, golden yellow. Big white foamy head that disappeared into a nice lacing. Although the lacing disappeared as the beer was consumed. The aroma is pretty strong for a beer that may initially come off as being possibly weak in stature. Nose is full of strong polish hops with just a tiny hint of sweetness and alcohol. Smells like a strong pilsner, actually. The taste starts out with the same hops in the aroma. I can imagine that some folks might find this flavor to be a little stringent. The hops get stronger as the flavors spread through the palate, then in comes some sweetness and a little bit of alcohol. Finishes pretty dry with a slight biscuity aftertaste. Overall, a very smooth mouthfeel with little carbonation presence. Nice. Now, this beer may seem not too drinkable at first, and I wasn't able to test out my theory. However. I think after two or three my palate would adjust quite nicely and I could really settle into a good session.
POSITIVE	I had the 'normal' Speciale Reserve, not the USA version.   This beer is amber colored and has a small head and lots of carbonation. A beautiful site.  Smell is caramel and fudge, toffee with a robust malt backbone and some fruity notes of ripe apples.  Taste is toffee with caramel, supported by a strong maltiness. It appears to be slightly smokey and fruity, in general pretty complex and rich. The alcohol is not very apparent. Mouthfeel is very silky and smooth with a prickly feeling on the tongue. A very nice strong ale from one of the best breweries in Belgium.
NEGATIVE	Fairly dark brew, nearing opaque in the thick parts of my glass but really shows some coke colored highlights around the edges. Head came on about a half inch thick and then reduced, but the carbonation seems to hold a loose foam cap. Lacing grips the glass fairly well.  Nice toasted aroma with notes of milk chocolate. A bit of lactose is evident and works with the chocolate well. A bit of alcohol shows through but it is subtle and blends well, it isn't too fusel smelling.   Taste is a bit different than I was expecting from the aroma. There are still some toasted malt flavors that come through, but the rest of this is kind of muttled together and I have a hard time picking out some of the less prevalent flavors. The chocolate which was in the aroma isn't really as dominant as I would have expected. Some alcohol is noticable in the finish.  Good mouthfeel though, a bit thicker than other Baltic's I have had. Fairly creamy really. Okay drinkability in my book, this seems like a good beer but doesn't quite do it for me. It has some high points but the flavor doesn't suit me.
POSITIVE	poured from a 22oz. bottle into a pint glass (drank on 2/8/08)  A: Pours a gorgeous glowing amber with a thin bubbly white head. Incredible sparkling clarity rounds out a nice-looking beer.  S: Too mild for my liking, try as I might, I could only barely detect slight hints of orange & coriander, and almost no maltiness at all.  T/M: Luckily the taste improves dramatically from the nose! Coriander is definitely present, as is a nice hint of nutmeg and orange which blends well into a tasty roasted body. And then finally the hops kick in, finishing things off in a lip-smacking fashion. Mouthfeel is spot-on for what I wanted in this beer, it's carbonated nicely and just coats the mouth all over.  D: Easily drinkable, might be one of my favorite winter warmer-styled ales, it just goes down so smooth. Well-worth seeking out.
NEGATIVE	Pours a dark amber, thick head, little carbonation. Sweet and musty smell and flavor, strong astringent alcohol taste. Very slight hoppiness.  Feels thick and hearty, somewhat syrupy or sludgy in the mouth. Too astringent to qualify as a very drinkable brew for me, but definitely worth trying.  Found on tap an the Taphouse in Bellevue, WA.
POSITIVE	Cloudy golden yellow with no head to speak of.  Light lemon-citrus and tea aroma with mild spice and cinnamon-apple.  Dry hops flavor throughout with a little honey sweetness pushing through in the beginning and a little citrus sourness at the end to balance the hops dryness.  Not a ton of flavor, but still very full in the mouth and quite drinkable.
NEGATIVE	pours a brown copper color with spare head, spare lacing, and soft carbonation. very very strong citrus hop smell that was very good to the nose. taste was more of a piney grass hop flavor, with some citrus hints. very harsh bitter taste and finish. medium body with a oily sticky texture. long flavor duration and by far the most bitter beer i've ever had. alcohol fairly well hidden but apparent in the finish. this beer was not even close to as good as i expected it to be, still a decent brew but i was very let down.
NEGATIVE	When poured from bottle, pale gold with decent dense white head - and some yeast in suspension as with most wheat beer styles.  Aroma of fruit, bananas and cloves as you would expect from the German style Weiss beer, hint of sweetness, though somewhat muted.  Decent flavours typical of a traditional German Hefe Weiss beer, tending to the sweeter side rather than dry, though with no outstanding depth or character you would expect from the best examples of the style. A pleasant enough wheat beer, no vices, but nothing special either, though cheaper than some, so could be a good buy for a summer thirst quencher.  JohnW B'ham UK Oct 2010
POSITIVE	Bright gold color, good foamy creamy head, nice lace, hops, grassey, malt aroma, with faint detection of skunkiness; smooth, crisp, balanced malt and hops flavor, refreshing and satisfying, smooth dry hop aftertaste.  A good pilsner for a hot summer Florida day.  Prosit.
NEGATIVE	A: Pours molasses amber color. 1/4" tan head   S: Smells like a strong ale. Not much else coming to mind, some alcohol and perhaps molasses and nuts at the end. Even less fruit hinted at.   T: Light caramel flavors abruptly muted by a slight alcohol presence over the malt. Some low aa hops definitely present too. Nothing too remarkable.   M: light malty mouthfeel left with some tingle from a slightly high carbonation for the style.   O: Meh beer, probably wouldn't bother getting again. It's cheap though.
POSITIVE	Presentation: 1pint 9fl oz short necked brown bottle. No freshness date.  Appearance: Pours a deep, dark tawny brown (same colour as the bottle almost), crowned with a frothy, tight, off-white cream lace with plenty of retention and substance. Exceptional.  Note: there is yeast sediment in the bottle.  Smell: Soft, but distinct and bold, smoke aromas -- reminds me of spicy cold kielbasa and a wood fire.  Taste & Mouthfeel: Fairly light-bodied, with a touch of smoothness upfront that eventually turns a bit coarse on the palate, going bitty and crisping up from the beer's carbonation and a smack of wheat astringency and light floral bitterness. Malt sweetness is low, but there's plenty of body under the crisp dry character. Smoke flavours are everywhere, leaving a smooth char flavour that blends perfectly with an edge of spicy clove, wood character and splash of grape juice. Lots of residual smoke flavours rock the dry finish, hints of yeast.  Notes & Drinkability: I just love a good rauchbier, and this is one of the best. It combines the pleasantries of a tasty wheat beer with old school flavours to create one helluva an exceptional brew!
POSITIVE	Appearance:   My Glencairn tasting glass was a perfect fit for this job. I pulled the cap off this heavy ale and was greeted with a slight wisp of carbonation gasses. On the pour I went slowly and was left with a thin creamy head. When I hold my glass up to the light there is an array of deep brown and ruby-plum like colors that are pristine and clear. On the viscosity check I gave a generous swirl and noticed a healthy amount of legs sliding down my glass walls ever so slowly.  Aroma:  Wow, this is a huge punch in the face from the bourbon barrel. Initially all I can get is a huge amount of booze and oak from the barrel but as I let this warm up a little bit a load of caramel soaked raisins and burnt brown sugar are pushing through. I am having a hard time trying to pull out any Belgian notes but hey, the barrel is strong on the nose in this one. In the back end some fig flavors are rounding it out and even a slight pipe tobacco aroma.  Taste:  I have to admit this is one of the most interesting variations I have ever had for the style, but I like it! Right off the start there is a huge kick from the bourbon but it is so much more complex than that. Vanilla, plums, figs, and bready malt is huge in the base. Smooth and warming on the palate and is reminding me of banana foster with some toasted marshmallow. I can see how some people might find this to be a little too sweet for their palate but this is right up my alley on this cold night. In the finish, a hint of bubblegum is poking through which is definitely a component of that Belgian yeast.  Drinkability:  Overall this was one killer barley wine! The only thing Im a little upset about is that this was my only bottle. This is a true sipping ale, and I must admit Im glad that I lit a fire right before I started this one because they seem to go hand in hand on a cold snowy night like tonight. If you come across this one or have the opportunity to trade for it by all means go for it, because not only is it a limited release, it is fantastic for the style. Well until next time.
POSITIVE	It's just plain brown. The head fades rather quickly. The smell is very nice, with traces of apple, raisins, toffee, and a just noticeable chocolate smell. This has a very pleasant array of flavors and a happy-making smoothness. Thanks again to all the monks.
POSITIVE	Pours a cloudy dull pale amber color with a HUGE foamy off white head that fades slowly leaving tons of Belgian lacing behind. The aggressive boozy maple character dominates over vanilla doughy sweetness. Well carbonated, the mouth feel is medium full bodied and creamy smooth with a nice coating nature. Full flavored, the vanilla maple character is mirrored nicely from the nose. The maple tappers off to a coconut bourbon flavor that is off the charts imaginative. The 12% ABV is well advertised and brewed into this beverage with serious talent. A really well done!! Many thanks Brau!
NEGATIVE	Poured cool into my Corsendonk tulip A - Decants a deep brown w/ about an inch of fluffy sand colored head. Generous lace hugs the glass as the tightly formed bubbles decrease.  S - Deep malty tones w/ a light woody earthiness. A whiff of alcohol in the deep roasted nose.  M - Slick, smooth sweet w/ an ample amount of bitter hop and malt texture w/ light carbonation and heavy body - very dense.  T - A rich blend of roasted and dark malt w/ a sugary tip and pungent spiced pine hop flavors. There is an almost smoky flavor w/ salty woody qualities. A creaminess and smoothness of oats makes for a good foundation w/ an allotment of hop flavor and bitterness. that is high for a Scottish ale, but not unpleasant in the least. There is a very good balance and this intense brew keeps reminding you w/ a lingering sweetness.  D - A big Scottish style brew, I couldn't drink this all the time, but every now and then a big malty brew is enjoyable. I found it to be a ting harsh the first time I drank this, but on repeated tastes found it to be well made and better than average.
POSITIVE	Sampled this "Easy Ryder" on tap at the brewpub in Cambridge, MA.  This rye beer poured a cloudy, amber color with white foam that persisted and coated the glass thoroughly, as rye beers often do. The smell was malty with a touch of rye malt and a lot of hops! The taste was malty with elements of bread and rye and with lots of hops. There was a nice hoppy bitterness balanced with a touch of malt sweetness. The mouthfeel was smooth and crisp with medium-full body and moderate carbonation. There was an enjoyable lingering maltiness and hoppiness. This was a very fine "rye IPA" as I feel like calling it. I want more of this one.
NEGATIVE	Pours a nice dark golden color with a two-finger pearl white head. Really nice lacing and head retention for the style. Didn't get much from the aroma. A bit of a grainy, toasted aroma with a hint of pine. Flavor beings with a nice, sweet, toasty malt. Subtle hints of toffee and caramel mix well with the grain flavor. Ends with a very quick hit of pine hops. Really creamy and refreshing mouthfeel, feels a lot thicker than the flavor profile suggests. Overall, a solid pale ale with a nice little flavor, but certainly not a memorable beer of this style.
POSITIVE	Poured from a 1pt 0.9oz bottle.  A: Deep brown color with a light tan head.   S: Smells like smoked pork.  T: The strong smokey flavor dominates here, although it's not overwhelming. A fair amount of sweetness up front. It's hard to pick up through the smoke, but I can taste some faint caramel and dark fruits.  M: Moderate mouthfeel, not as thick as expected. Very smooth. Light carbonation  D: Thoroughly enjoyed this, but it isn't something I could drink in any situation.   This is probably the most interesting beer I've ever had. To be honest, I didn't care for it much the first time around (mostly because of poor food-pairing). The second and subsequent tastings have been more rewarding. Give it a chance.
POSITIVE	GLASS: Saison Dupont Becker TEMP: Served at approx 45 degrees  Pours a very golden orange color with very light hints of amber. The two-finger thick head of fluffy foam is a slightly off-white color. Retention is great and lacing is plentiful.  This smells like a citrus bomb. Awesome! Tons of Fresh orange and tangerine notes. Light hints of lemon and grapefruit. There is even a wonderful level of pineapple presence, just below the surface.  The citrus notes carry through, quite nicely. This one is big and juicy! There are some nice hints of pine sap and grapefruit skin coming out, as well. Light honey sweetness. A good maltiness holds the whole thing together.  This is medium-bodied and has a high level of carbonation. It feels clean, yet not overly crisp.  This is really a great representation of what I think of when I think of a 'good' IPA. I could drink gallons of this stuff....it's delicious! Once again, Founder's Brewing comes through with flying colors!
NEGATIVE	Pours a deep dark red colour, with a short-lived one finger head.   Aromas of licorice / star anaise from the Randle   Taste is licorice, but also of watered-down sugar. No real bitterness.  Mouthfeel is sweetish, light, sparkly.   Overall, not a bad drop but the Taphouse need to say which beers go the the Randle, and also what on earth they put in it!!! They could, in theory, put peppermint in it, and we'd all be in for a 'surprise'.
POSITIVE	Murky dark kumquat--that is actually clear when backlit with bright sunlight--capped by a manila-vanilla colored head of compact foam. This is a Wee Heavy? It looks much lighter than it ought to (foreshadowing).  The nose is interesting, but doesn't really fit the style either. It smells like fermented golden fruits with an earthy hoppiness. Wee Beast might as well be an English pale ale or an ESB as far as the nose is concerned. No dark malts, no peat and no smoke. 'You sir, have had your Wee Heavy membership card revoked'.  It also tastes like an English pale ale (granted, one that is maltier, sweeter and more full than usual). The malt is pretty heavily toasted, although that still doesn't result in any flavors that make me think of the stated style. I take that back, I do pick up a pleasant licorice-like flavor, but it's more 'blond licorice' if that makes any sense whatsoever.   The body/mouthfeel is midway between full and medium and is as smooth as the Scottish summer days are long. Scant carbonation provides enough energy to keep the beer from feeling flat and makes drinking it a cinch. A delicious cinch at that.   I had high hopes for Wee Beast since I love the style--that it's billed as anyway--and since it's brewed on the Isle of Skye, the home of one of my very favorite Scotch Whiskies (Talisker). I do like it though, so my scores will have to reflect some sort of compromise between appeal and faithfulness to style.
POSITIVE	Had this on tap at Horse Brass. It arrived at the same time as my wife's Guinness and our friend's Black Butte. The similarity in the beers visibly was uncanny. It was a solid opaque black graced with a regal quaff of foam.  The aroma was tart and slightly smokey. Mild, but partly due to the competition with the fancy pipe smoke from the guy sitting next to us.  The taste was astounding. Its rare that you stumble across something that can easily replace a standard with such ease. Nothing in this beer is overstated, but the smooth combination of dry, tart and peat, with a slight fruitiness in just the right amount for a sweet compliment.  This is a stellar seasonal, and I hope they keep the recipe. I would not change a single thing. There seems to be confusion over what this beer is. Caldera's "site" says that it changes by season. This years seems to be somewhere between a tart stout and a old brown.
POSITIVE	A- Pours a golden color with two finger head. Nice lacing down the whole glass. Well laced down the whole glass.   S- Big hops, pine and citrus.  T- Very well balanced. The hops are not as big as the smell. Nice malt presence, some complex citrus with a bit of pine. No alcohol detected.  M- On the lighter side of medium bodied. Carbonation is pretty smooth, maybe a bit on the light side. Hop bite lingers on the tongue  D- I could make a session out of these, but the ABV is a bit high for that. Very solid IPA, would have again.
NEGATIVE	On the pour a pellucid golden color with a prodigious head that is bright white in color and the texture frothy as it evaporate the lace left behind forms a fine sealing sheet. Sweet malt dominates the nose, as always fresh, crisp and clean with the start malt and mild in its sweetness, top fair to middling in feel to the palate. Finish has a crisp acidity and the hops as expected, mild and pleasing, quite dry and a drinkable beer, with the aftertaste dry and lingering.
POSITIVE	22oz bomber in duvel tulip (no date)  A: Completely black (no surprise) with an almost non-existent cappuccino colored head that disappears immediately leaving no lace.  S: Chocolate, coffee, roasted malts, some hoppy bitterness,  T: Very much like the nose, the chocolate is very apparent, with some roasted bitterness. A little bit of sweetness in the background. No hint of alcohol which is somewhat surprising. A hint of yeast fruitiness as it warms.  M: Low carbonation and a richness from residual sugars, makes for a smooth beer. I was expecting more of a creamy mouthfeel since it is an oatmeal stout. It is not like this is watery or over-attenuated, I just expected a little something different from a standard RIS.  D: This is an excellent RIS, very much worth seeking out if you like the style. I could easily see making this a regular habit if the price was right, not to mention availability in KY.
POSITIVE	ahhh, a kick in yer face from a dirty bastard...  Nice, maple syrup colored body. Nice ruby underglow. The cream head disapated quickly and looked more like a flat rootbeer, but I expected that with this style. The taste is filled with a diacetyl, butterlicious smoothness. A toffee, carmelized element fills the mouth wonderfully. There is massive malt presence with barely any hop presence.   The beer is remarkable smooth and slides down the throat with a sense of heaviness that is not too intense. The high abv is hidden very well. Its only presence is in the warmth of the tummy. This is a great wee heavy that hits the spot.
NEGATIVE	500 ml bottle purchased at LaBodega in Riverside, CA for $3.89 in March 2006. I tried this one a year or more ago, and wasn't real fond of it at the time, but that was before I went to England and learned a lot more about English beer, so I thought I should give it another go.  Pours a yellowy golden, with a touch of red into my Bath Ale Imperial Pint glass. A substantial solid off-white head sits on top of the bubbly mass- this one is full of carbonation.  Aroma is initially fairly sharp weedy hops, much harsher than I like. Flavor is much the same- there is a malt profile to be sure, but this tastes more like a bitter to me than a pale ale.  Definitely drinkable, and I love to support any beer that's been "tempered over burning witches", but I'll spend my poundpencefarthings on other choices from now on.
POSITIVE	It came to me a bright but cloudy yellow, almost glowing. A pillow of clean white head flaoted softly and lingered enough to leave a pretty lace pattern to the bottom of the glass.   The aroma delivered first a waft of grassy citrus, blending lemon and lime zest, along with a studding of cloves. A yeasty sourness banks the grain character, and the requisite banana note makes a brief and rather non-descript appearance.   The first sip washed in what at first seemed to be the front line of a sweet wheat and grain attack, but it was very promptly turned aside by the drying sourness of the yeast and the accompanying elements of non-cloying citrus. A clove nature came along for the ride, as well as a shaving of ginger. The dryness came more forward toward the finish, leaving a slight puckering in the mouth as it lingered and ebbed. The quick 180 out of the gate was suprising, and ended up very refreshing, if a little busy.   Light bodied, it was lively on the palate, and coated and washed away in a timely fashion.   As mentioned, that rapid turn of events upon sipping it was halting initially, but it ened up being just what the doctor ordered on a hot early summer evening, teasing with sweetness and satiating with a crisp, lingering dry/sour duet. Busy, sure, and maybe more than I expected, but the surprises here were way more positive in balance. It's a smooth drinking fool, and while it's not the top rung, it's close enough that this one will be something to enjoy the whole summer through.
POSITIVE	I had this IPA while visiting the brewpub on a recent rip to Fayetteville. On tap, the beer has a deep copper-amber color. Its head is full-on white, fairly thick, and has a nice longevity. The aroma is a pleasing mix of both malt and hops. It presents a floral and herbal hop aroma, backed by a slightly toasted malt smell. The taste is similar. Caramel and biscuit flavors mingle with floral hops. This is not a hop monster. Anyone who appreciates balance in an IPA would like this brew. Its a solidly English style IPA. It has a full body, with modest carbonation and a smooth mouthfeel. Too bad they dont have it on cask, I bet this one would have been delicious as a real ale.
POSITIVE	12-oz bottle poured into a pint glass.  A = Deep mahogany with ruby red tint when held up to light, with very small tan head that quickly resolves into a mere ring of bubbling around the edge of the glass.  S & T = A very coffee smelling porter, like a coffee with cream and sugar topped off with a chocolate frosted donut. Good bitterness shows up in the mid-palate and continues into the finish to keep this from being too sweet.  M = Medium body, good mouthcoating, clear strong carbonation present but in a tickling way, not in a biting way.  D = This is really a fine porter that I just love to drink. Great drinkability. I just wish the ABV were a little lower to enjoy more of them.
POSITIVE	Poured from a bomber into snifter. Shared with friends. Review from notes.  Pours a pitch black with a minimal dark brown head that quickly dissipates down leaving just a ring around the circumference of the glass.   The nose has tons of whiskey/vanilla notes on it as well as dark fruits, tobacco, lingering sweetness. The whiskey notes come across more like a rye than a bourbon.  The taste is much of the same: whiskey, vanilla, tobacco, very slight dark fruits, toasted malts. The whiskey and vanilla dominate the profile but are not over whelming, although close.  Huge, thick mouth feel on this bad boy. Nice carbonation. Poor retention. Very heavy bodied.  And enjoyable brew for sure but one I would only want a few ounces of. Enjoy and share with friends. Recommended.
POSITIVE	A - Deep amber, serious 3 finger head. Stays.  S- Very sweet, lots of caramel. Hoppy.  T- Enormous malts overpower everything to me. It's pleasant enough, but the complexity is lessened due to malts. Mild alcohol in the back, surprisingly. Floral, but not as much as I'd like. Thankfully, the floral notes do "stick" once you get there.  M- Highly carbonated, medium body.  D- This is a nice, drinkable beer. I sucked down two fast. Far from world class, and I certainly don't understand the "A" rating. Pleasant nonetheless.
POSITIVE	Dark, rubescent chestnut with considerable reddish amber accents. The beer is opaque, although bright sunlight makes a valiant effort to make it all the way through the glass. Up above is a compact cap of lightly toasted ecru foam that has a featureless surface, which usually indicates a softness that does not bode well for lacing. Very little sticks in the end.  Wow, smoked is right! This baby comes pretty close to the smokiness of the Schlenkerla line of beers and is more like a raunchy rauchbier than any smoked porter that I've ever had. Smoke 'em if you've got 'em is what I always say and O'Fallon has done just that. The beer smells more like hickory-smoked meat than anything else and smells less like a porter than it probably should. Since almost no beerness is evident, the score will have to be a grudging compromise.  This is delicious beer. Again though, comparisons to smoke-cured meat just cannot be ignored. If that sounds disgusting to you, put the bottle down and move along to something a little less adventurous. Smoke permeates the flavor profile, but it does fade enough by the second half of the mouthful to allow some semblance of roasted maltiness to peek through.  I do pick up some smoked, sweet chocolate to go along with the smoked barley, but it's a minor player. There's also a hint of smoked bitter hops on the smoke-filled finish (get the idea?). The body is a minor letdown in that it's no bigger than light-medium.  I knew nothing about Smoked Porter before plucking it off the shelf, but I'm always up for a good smoked beer. This is definitely a good smoked beer, albeit one that would benefit from a touch more malt to fill out the body. A solid effort that makes me curious about the rest of the O'Fallon line.
POSITIVE	Pours a slightly cloudy mild copper with sticky white lacing. Smells all of hops, tons of fresh grassy and citrus hops. Taste is very hoppy yet nicely sweet from a generous amount of malts. Hops are very citrusy, grass and pine. The hops and malt sweetness fight it out on the palate. You win. This is thick and lush, sticky on the lips as well.  I really like drinking this, it's so smooth and tasty and worth the reasonable price that Hoppin Frog charges.
NEGATIVE	22oz bottle shared at Phatz' sour beer tasting  Appearance: Very deep ruby red color with a dull ruby red head that gets to about an inch and dissipates. Barely any lacing sticks to the glass.  Smell: Extremely upfront in the aroma. Sour raspberries all the way. I detect a lot of sweet sugars as well, as with a raspberry preserve.  Taste: Very strong sweet and tart raspberry flavor. Alcohol is huge and clocks in at 12%, really making its presence known. The flavor is vinous and almost wine-like in intensity and shows a woody touch of flavor (from what?). Good thing I love raspberries.  Mouthfeel: Again, sugary and viscous in the mouth. Tartness is there and so is a little bit of carbonation. Alcohol is huge for me, and leaves a warming belt.  Drinkability: Why don't they bottle stuff like this in a 12 oz bottle? It would be quite hard to open one of these 22s and finish it by yourself. At $15.99 and with it being so limited, I wasn't thoroughly impressed, but it was worth trying. This is a surefire dessert beer. I'll stick with the Rubaeus from now on.
POSITIVE	Into a pint glass, pours somewhere between copper and reddish orange, with smallish tan-white head, everpresent layer of film, good stringy lacing. Pretty hoppy aroma, juicy grapefruit and sweet malt, quite good. is there rye in there? .. Who cares!! Taste picks up on the hop train, whole heaps of citric floral goodness, with a nice backing of earthy herbal malts, maybe some of that rye thats supposed to be in there, some caramel malts. A long drawn out tasty finish. Mouth is smooth and crisp, lively and lip smacking. Also, oddly seemed to hold on to the cool longer than physics can explain.. it was wierd. Anywho, a very good beer, glad I have a couple more.
NEGATIVE	A good light lager, and that is saying a lot. It looks golden clear and highly carbonated, like a typical lager. Actually retains a white loosely knit head and laced a bit on the glass. Smelled lightly malty and cereal-like. Slight souring and grainy. Tasted also slightly malty and cereal-like. Exhibited some flavors of butter-popcorn, vegitive, and corn sugar. Body was light and clean. Finish was crisp and clear. No true flavors pronounced themselves, but this beer is good at washing down pizza and nachos.
POSITIVE	A - D-A-R-K with a thin, but frothy top, and decent retention. Label reads "bottle conditioned" and bottle date is just over a year ago.   S - Sweet, molasses, candied fruit. some roasted coffee  T&M - fruit and dark chocolate, silky/milky feel with coffee and roasted grain on the finish  D - very drinkable, good cool/cold weather brew.   Overall a phenomenal beer, unbelievable balance, feel is perfect complement to flavor. Superbly crafted and something well worth seeking out.  *Note - I bought this again over the weekend (4-18), the bottle date was 2 months (as opposed to about a year for the initial review 4-10). It had a significantly different taste and feel, the flavor was more roasted and bitter and the feel seemed more dry with more of an alcohol bite. The aging does this one justice, definitely worth the wait.
NEGATIVE	Poured from bottle into tulip. Appearance is dark amber color with light, beige head. Aroma is of malty sweetness, toffee, dark fruits, and a slight boozy-ness. Taste is complex - it started off with a heavy character of toasted malts, sweet bread, and caramel. As the it warmed up, there was more and more strong dark fruit flavors especially plum, which combined with the alcohol gave it a somewhat boozy quality. As my palate grew more accustomed to the heavy malt bill, I noticed more of the subtle hop bitterness that was lying underneath. Palate was full-bodied, thick in texture sitting heavy in the mouth, light and soft carbonation, and a bitter finish. Not my choice from one of my favorite breweries, Founders.
POSITIVE	Enjoyed this beer at the brewery before the EBF while Sam Calagione, Tomme Arthur, Rob Tod, et al were having some rounds of their own in the front corner. This incarnation of the brew is made of 100% sour mash, fermented with tart cherries on Belgian yeast, then aged in French-oak chardonnay and pinot noir barrels with brettanomyces - 8% ABV. In concept it sounds quite close to Supplication, but this definitely has its own personality. It arrives an opaque cherry/brown in an enlarged flute, with a half inch tan head that slowly subsides. The bouquet consists of sour cherry and brett, with a nice oak kicker and notes of raspberry/blackberry in the background. The first sip is a rush of sour cherries and brett that hits the back of the throat and lingers. In addition to raspberry and other berry notes, the wine barrels really add another dimension. There are flashes of chardonnay, but the pinot really comes through in the aftertaste - very nice. The medium body is bone dry, with medium to high carbonation and the sourness seems to decline slightly as I progress. Overall it is well-crafted, delicously drinkable for a sour ale, and was the perfect beer to prepare me for the Extreme Beer Fest.
POSITIVE	Black color. Medium body---not syrup thick. Aroma is burnt grain. Bitterness comes from burnt grain, rye and lots of hops. Even better on tap at brew pub. Much less filling than stouts. Founders deserves credit for this "different" brew. The best of the black brews I have tried!
NEGATIVE	Pours a medium amber color with a 1 finger white head that lasts just a little while before fading away.  Smells of caramel malt upfront with just a hint of hops towards the end. A little plain.  Taste cleanly reflects the smell, with notes of caramel and toffee most dominant and light hops in the finish. Not much to it but not bad.  Light to medium body with medium carbonation. Nothing special but it seemed like the best offering available. I only found myself in this setting for a meeting so I doubt I'd make my way out again for another. Overall, a decent brew but nothing to get excited about.
NEGATIVE	Aroma is marijuana, lemons, pine and toffee. The dank marijuana flavor only increases on the palate. Unfortunately, theres also a pretty big solvent note and booze is apparent. It drinks somewhat easily for the abv, but this is still a big and sorta sticky beer. A big bitter finish reins in the malt sweetness. Its a huge rich DIPA that stays away from the candied hop territory of sweeter versions. Appearance is a bright orange-amber with a small, dissipating off-white head. Pretty good stuff but not something Id want often.
POSITIVE	Shared this one with capra12. Served from a 12oz. bottle poured into a Blue Point snifter.   A: Poured a vigorous 1 finger dark chocolate fine head with ok retention. Brew itself was black and opaque like motor oil with near no carbonation. Lacing was spotty but ample.   S: Overwhelming coffee nose with characters of dark and milk chocolate, vanilla, and bourbon.   T: Wow. So damn deep and complex. Starts off with milk and dark chocolate. A strong bourbon character develops along with a nice roasted coffee palate. Finishes with re-emerging dark and milk chocolate and a slightly alcoholic aftertaste.   M: Oily and flat, this one coats the mouth nicely. Deep bodied and viscous and ends dry and clean.   D: This is Founders Breakfast Stout but just better in every way that it could be better. More chocolate, deeper coffee, and overall more complexity and character. An amazing experience that I can't wait to have again.
POSITIVE	Here goes nothing.  Devil Dancer is a very attractive mahogany color, accompanied by a small, short-lived head and mediocre lacing.  It smells fucking hoppy, a piney and peppery hoppiness. There's a surprising amount of fruity maltiness as well.  Taste has dark fruits upfront, followed by some alcohol (13%? Christ, I have shit to do today), an intense hoppiness, and a rather pleasant roastedness. The bitterness lingers for a long, long time.  Thick, syrupy mouthfeel.  Well, Devil Dancer is very drinkable, as long as you drink it slowly. I thought I was going to have to choke this down, but no--surprisingly smooth. Given that, however, it's still a hardcore sumbitch, definitely a sipper. I think this is the "biggest" beer I've ever had.  "I was expecting something BEASTLY, but it's actually pretty good."
POSITIVE	Bomber poured in Duvel Tulip.  A: Essentially black with a dark brown head. Head retention is fairly minimal although a consistent ring hangs around for the glass's duration.  S: Bittersweet chocolate. A bit less coffee than traditional BORIS. More dark fruit sweetness than the standard version.  T: Taste was a bit roastier than anticipated based on the nose. The chocolate is certainly there and a nice creaminess is imparted by the oats. A sweeter offering than the standard version.  M: Nice and thick, thicker than many other offerings within the style. Not overly carbonated although carbonation can be found on the tongue with each sip.  O: Overall, this is another solid offering from Hoppin Frog, although I do prefer normal BORIS to this variation. The sweetness in this one steals the show and takes away from the upfront roast I find so enjoyable in HF's flagship beer.
POSITIVE	This beer was brought back from MI by my roommate. Hell of a haul, and this is probably the crown jewel.  The beer pours with no head, but once the beer stops pouring a thin little tan head rises and falls in the same amount of time. Still looks good. Very dark and completely opaque. Lacing is very minimal.  The smell is awesome. Vanilla bean, bourbon, wood, cocoa, bold black coffee, hops, and ethanol. Awesome stuff.  The taste is just as exceptional. Not too sweet, not too bitter or roasty, not too boozy, not too coffee flavored. Just a perfect balance.  The body is thick and chewey. Also very creamy with the lack of carbonation. Very good. Very drinkable despite the bold flavors and high alcohol. Even though I got a hell of a good buzz off of one, I want another. But alas I must refrain.  I love it, and I'm so glad that my roommate timed his trip to MI when he did.
NEGATIVE	Had this on a whim at the bar. Was originally attracted by the bottle (ridiculous, I know). The beer poured a nice amber color - a little lighter than expected. There was virtually no smell to it. The taste was nothing special at first, but a very strange after taste began to develop. The taste was unlike any beer I'd had in the past. Not particularly unpleasant, but not a particularly enjoyable taste either. The mouthfeel was surprisingly pleasant and was quite smooth.  Overall, if it came in a smaller size, it might have been more enjoyable. It's easy to drink, but its distinct taste was not for my palette.
POSITIVE	12 oz bottle poured into Sam Adams glass. Good head and lacing, pours a deep amber. Aroma is citrus piney hops, with a bit of toffee. Taste has a great hop profile, bitter piney yet plenty of flavorful citrus fruit as well. Dry finish, medium viscosity. Overall a very nice west coast style IPA.
NEGATIVE	Nice pouring brew with a deep redish brown and lite brown foamy head. Nice lace clinging to the side of the glass. The aroma is hard for to put a finger on. Either a subtle smokey malt or something more to the medicinal range.   Easy and smooth on the tounge. The taste does remind me of a Pub I once visited not to far from Coventry. Comfortable and familiar.
POSITIVE	Pint at Parkside  What a unique brew. The beer was a deep red. A fair amount of light shows through. There was a small head. The smell was somewhat of coconuts. The taste was unmistakable. This beer was exploding with coconut flavor. I don't even like coconut and this beer won me over. There would be no doubt as to what was in this brew. I usually don't give 5's but in the taste I think this one deserves it. It tastes just exactly as advertised. The mouthfeel was a nice. Kind of like those sugar coconut bars you find in the grocery store. I will drink this beer again.
NEGATIVE	A: Pours a golden orange, almost a nuclear orange, with a single finger of creamy white head. The head dissipates to a cap. There is a moderate amount of lacing. 4.0  S: Smells like a centennial hop bomb, bring it on!. Tropical fruits and citrusy aromas dominate with a hint of crisp malt in the background. Nothing new or overly interesting here, but the aroma is quite nice. 4.0  T: Starts with a strong bitterness that eventually tones down and gives way to a strong, almost perfume-like, hop flavor. Malts are completely masked by hops. Hop flavors are tad resiny with quite a bit of tropical fruit as well as some citrus. The finish has a bit of undesirable hop bitterness that lingers. There isn't too much that is new or interesting in this beer, but it is solid overall. Strong hop flavors don't muddle that well together and fall up flat in the end, other beers with 90+ IBUs can do a better job. 3.5  M: Luscious and creamy for a DIPA. Perfectly carbonated with a medium body. 4.5   D: Not complex enough to warrant a second serving. A lingering bitterness that makes this one not so refreshing and makes me not want to take another sip. 3.5  O: A decent DIPA that doesn't satisfy by high expectations from such a great brewery.
POSITIVE	A_Pours a thick viscous black with a thick tan head with nice retention. Some lacing.  S_Dark chocolate , espresso,roasted malt. Picking up some hops.  T_Bitter chocolate and coffee.Creamy vanilla too. Pretty roasty. Little hoppy in the after taste. Nice dry finish.  M_Thick,creamy smooth, and full bodied goes down nicely.  D_Great session beer or sipper depending on your mood. Very nice porter overall.
POSITIVE	Pours a nice pale amber/copper color with a decent creamy off-white head that slowly sinks to a nice film that completely lines the glass.  Nice toasty/biscuity malt aroma with some nice fruity esters as well, apples and others.  After the great nose on this brew the taste is a little dissappointing.  Light toasty maltiness with some vague fruity esters again but I was hoping for a little more definition here, there is a nice lingering light bitterness in this one though.  Very creamy and fairly smooth on the tongue, but a bit of tangyness that I didn't really like, this brew is rather drinkable however.
NEGATIVE	I've never been a big lover of German Pilsners so this low rating shouldn't reflect on this brew but it does reflect my tastes on this style. When a I come across this style and it's got the fresh cut grass aromas and tastes I just find it unwelcoming to me. I found this beer to fall into that situation. It's a clear yellow brew with the flavors and aromas mentioned above. Just not my favorite.
NEGATIVE	A standard 500 ml bottle emptied into my righteous mug. Cooled beer removed from the fridge and consumed.  Appearance- A deep rich cola black. It has a slight head and lots of carbonation.  Smell- Sweetness and something akin to root beer. Tastes- A fair bit of sweetness with finish of roasted grain. The roasted finish is a bit harsh with out the bitterness or really any pleasant/satisfying kick.  Mouthfeel- A light body- normal for the style. Highly Carbonated and a thin finish.  Drinkability- A low ABV brew but as seen above and below its not really worth the cost. Just pick something else from Green Man and you'll thank yourself later.   Summary- A roasted root beer, overly sweet with a light mouthfeel and weird cross between sarsaparilla and roasted grain, with a lot of carbonation. This is the base beer for the Celt, which I enjoyed. However on its own its a different beast and untidy monkey of a working man's beer.
NEGATIVE	This beer is a deep orange but barely had any head. The smell is all cinnamon at first with other spices coming later. Smells like Big Red gum. The taste reminds me of toothpaste. Minty with some cinnamon, not what I expected. The body is also kind of thin for being imperial. Overall a disappointment, maybe a bad bottle?
POSITIVE	22 oz bomber from Roth's Vista Market, Salem. OR Very nice looking stout dark brown with a very attractive thick tan head. Aroma however is pretty subdued, toasty oats, some coffee and thats it. Not bad but for from impressive. Taste is unusual for style..its very coffeeish , not a lot of the oatiness, fruity, spicy almost has a "barnyard" sourness about it...strange but i actually like it. Quite thin mouthfeel for the style, but it does make this drinkable. Overall a very odd stout..lighter and the sourness..just weird. Seems like the recipe chamged for this beer. Alc is 4.2% IBUs now 40( though i could never tell).
NEGATIVE	Pours a clear gold color with a minimal ivory head and little lace. The aroma is malty and sweet with a nice floral hop character. The taste is light and somewhat hoppy. Citric and floral hop notes mingle firm maltiness. The finish is sweet with some hop flavor but not a lot of bitterness.  This beer is great for what it is; an all malt version of a Canadian macro lager. It has more complexity and flavor in general and woukd probably win over some Canadian drinkers.
POSITIVE	Draft at Founders.  Poured a dark brown color with a large frothy brown head that lasted with excellent lacing.  Moderate to heavy roasted dark chocolate, vanilla, woody and alcohol aroma.  Heavy bittersweet roasted sweet malty flavor with a heavy bittersweet and small alcohol bite finish of long duration.  Full body with a smooth texture and flat carbonation.  This is a standout beer.
POSITIVE	A very black color pour with a thin, creamy, dark brown head that diminishes to a nice thin ring,and leaves some good lacing down the sides of the glass. The aroma is of dark roasted malt, light coffee, faint toffee, and sweet dark fruitiness.Flavor is very roasty malt driven, coffee,bitter chocolate notes some wood or maybe grain,very balanced. Medium-bodied light carbonation, slick mouthfeel with a dry, bitter-roasted finish that features just a touch of alcohol. As always Founders makes it Yummy !
POSITIVE	Sampled 21JUL2004  Deep ruby red, with good tan head. Has a very nice grape smell, kinda like an oud bruin/grand cru, with a slight grain alcohol smell. I was expecting more punch on my palate but this Beer is surprisingly smooth and easy to drink. The mouthfeel was a bit like mineral water, it left some kind of effervescence I havn't felt very often with Beer. Strange but good. I'd certainly give this one another shot.
POSITIVE	A- Pours and opaque black, can't get any darker than this. About a finger of head, maybe a little more that is dark brown. Nice lacing as this is sticking to the entire glass.  S- Roasted malts slightly overpowered by the smell of alcohol, certainly not unappetizing though. A dark chocolate aroma tends to sneak through before being squashed out by the malt and alcohol.  T- The roasted malts jump around for around a couple of seconds before a dark chocolate bitterness kicks it of the way. The alcohol taste is hidden initially, but towards the end of the beer it leaps out almost unexpectedly and sticks to the palate for quite a long time.  M- Very chewy and thick with a smooth carbonation that makes this a smooth the entire way down.   D- The lingering taste of alcohol in this beer is the only real thing detracting from the drinkability. If you look past that and understand it is something to be expected out of a bigger beer, then this beer will be one you keep reaching for.
POSITIVE	Excellent Porter.  A: Weakest part of the beer. Dark walnut color with a somewhat firm tan head. The head dissolves quickly and leaves very little lace.  S: Forget the appearance. This beer has great aromas. Chocolate, oak, cherry, grape and a slight alcohol bite intermingle quite well. Smells a little like Brandy.  T: Extremely complex. Tastes of black grapes and berries, with a well balanced bitterness. Both sweet and dry. Bitter cherry notes linger in the finish. The alcohol adds a nice warmth going down.  M: Medium body. Not too thick. Somewhat slick on the tongue with the right amount of fizz.  D: A good night cap beer. Would be nice on a cold night in front of a fire. I wouldn't want more than one.
POSITIVE	Pours a two finger cream head that fades quickly to a thin layer leaving no lace. Cloudy amber color. Medium carbonation and medium bodied. Sweet alcohol nose. Flavor is a strong, sweet caramel, alcohol and grapefruit hops, lingering grapefruit aftertaste. Nice triple IPA. $3.80 for a 12oz bottle from Yankee Spirits South Attleboro, Ma.
NEGATIVE	Pours a murky dark chestnut brown color with a slightly yellowish jaundiced looking hues with a thin beige head that quickly disappears leaving no lacing.  Very earthy, swampy aroma with a little bit of creek water and old boot. Slight chocolate maltiness with subtle hops and a sweet alcohol presence which is very strong.  Again, the flavor is very earthy and leathery with a strong sweet alcohol presence, leathery maltiness, subtle hops, slight chocolate, brown sugar and dirt. There's also a strange vegetable presence with is quite unpleasant and a dirty bitter finish.   This was quite a disappointment for me especially since I love pretty much everything from Founders and enjoy the occasional old ale. I will have to revisit again in the future.
POSITIVE	22oz bottle obtained via Growling at the Moon from bb8189. Thanks for the opportunity.   Poured into a DFH tulip, formed an uneven dark brown skim above the opaque dark brown/black brew. Skim recedes to the rim and the slighted swirling in the center of the glass, with heavy legs as well as slow-falling lace. Aroma is vanilla, oak, dark sweetness, and alcohol.  Taste begins with dark syrupy sweetness, a peek of dried fruits and hops in the middle, and then oak and booze come along and kick ass. Swallow finds slight numbing, and definite lingering warmth. Mouthfeel is slickery smooth, with good drinkability in that the depth and variety of flavors invites you back for more. Busy offering, but still a nice treat.
POSITIVE	Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass (shoot me, i don't own a thistle glass). The brew pours a dark clear brownish color with copperishish highlights. The head is a massive 2+ fingers that are light carmel color and it deflates fast to leave a layer atop the beer. A nice slippery lacing consumes the glass as the beer is quaffed.   The aroma is of carmel, malts, and a touch of alcohol.   The flavor is very forward carmel and alcohol with no sign of any bitterness.   Sweetness is medium-high, perhaps being forward by a lowish attenuation.   Mouth feel is medium - heavy with it being just on the verge of being cloying. This is probably pretty close to a very good rendition of this style which brings up the real question. Do you judge a brew by ones personal preference or how close it is to hitting the mark as the style is outlined.   For me, it misses the mark as an enjoyable drinker, but as far as style goes, it's probably an A brew. I'll go with the latter and say that it is pretty spot on as far as style  description goes.
POSITIVE	Served in a standard pint glass. Poured an opaque brown about two shades away from black. Quarter-inch mocha-colored head dissipated into a thin slick of tiny effervescing bubbles; lacing was almost non-existent during the tasting. Very sweet nose consisting of brown sugar, chocolate, toffee. Taste consistent with nose, with the addition of some dark fruit detectable as the brew warmed and a pronounced hops bitterness indicated at the finish. Mouthfeel was medium-bodied and slightly viscous with a subtle carbonation to add some additional character. Alcohol was fairly well-hidden, but presented slightly as it warmed. I've been wanting to try this for a while, and I was not disappointed. This is an excellent brew that is widely accessible.
POSITIVE	A - Poured into a clear pint glass from the brown bottle. I found it interesting that Founders listed the IBU's on the label (15). This offering is a clear pinkish red color that poured with a half finger of frothy white head that dissipated somewhat quickly leaving an average lacing down the inside of the glass.  S - Smells weakly of cherries, also slightly wheaty...not much else to note here.  T - Tastes like fresh tart unsweetened cherries. The 6.5% ABV is well hidden...I can't detect it at all. Rather one dimensional but still pretty tasty nonetheless.  M & D - Thin mouthfeel that leaves a bit of bitter cherry aftertaste. Compared to other fruit beers I've had, this doesn't quite stack up (but I am spoiled by New Glarus, being from WI...and they have perfected the fruit beer). However, I'm a big fan of the style and could find myself sitting down with a few of these.
POSITIVE	Drank it from the can, surprised by the initial flavour - quite a bit going on for my less than experienced palate, but pleasant. Smell was nothing special, but not bad.   It was as cold as it could be after a 40 min. car ride from the liquor store and still very good. Nursed it for probably 30 min or so and it was just as good at the end.  Very drinkable and will definitely look for it again.
POSITIVE	My 100th review, (FINALLY)!!!  Thanks to ajsdad06 for the trade & newtony for giving me the opportunity to try this beer!   Per ajsdad06, this is an '07 Vintage. 12 oz bottle with no freshness date.  A: Pours a thick, opaque, super dark brown/black beer with a rich and creamy dark tan head when agitated. Average size bubbles with lacing climbing up the walls. Slight ring of brown suds remain after the beer relaxes. This is one serious looking stout.  S: Rich, chocolates and bourbon. Espresso or French roast coffee. Slight sniff of dark, cherry sweets - delightful.  Taste: Rich and flavorful mix of fresh coffees, dark and bitter chocolate swirls, heavily toasted malts, caramel. A Starbucks delivery truck just collided with a Jim Beam truck! Little to no bitterness, likely because of the calming effect (buffering) of the oatmeal, expect what's given off from the heavily roasted coffee beans. Aftertaste of more and more coffee beans. Flavor lingers in my mouth for some time. Just the right amount of bourbon seeping through. Very enjoyable, sip and savor this one.  M: Medium to heavy bodied, creamy and sticks to the back of my throat. Low levels of carbonation. It's like drinking a chilled liqueur.  D: Very nice, extremely well-balanced stout. This is an amazingly-crafted brew, wish it wasn't so hard to get. Frankly, it surprises me this is defined as an imperial stout (and not a Russian Imperial Stout). Glad I had the opportunity to try this one.
NEGATIVE	With a little bit darker color than expected in an IPA, this beer... nice. The consitancy feels a little thick, and the hops could be balanced a little better (it almost borders too close to an american barley wine to me). However, it's still a good drink, and worthy of your time.
POSITIVE	Appearance: Dark ruby brown with smallish head that retires quickly, leaving no lacework.  Smell: Mmmmm. Strong smoky aroma, of course. Many describe it similar to bacon, but I don't get that myself. It has more of a campfire smell to me. Also some pungent malt. And some phenolic medicinal notes, like camphor.  Taste: The smoke dominates the flavor profile, particularly during the finish. Mid-palate sees hints of malt coughing its way out from behind the clouds of smoke, but they're quickly obscured. The finish is smoke and hops. The smoke character is, again, not like bacon (not salty enough). It's what I imagine smoked maple syrup would taste like, if someone were to bother smoking maple syrup.  Mouthfeel: Thickish, but not full-bodied. Moderate carbonation.  Drinkability: I love these beers. If I were the sort of person who could settle down and drink just one type of beer regularly, it would be this one.  Overall: This is the King of Smoked Beer, and with good reason. The only smoke beer I've ever had that was better was the peat-smoked Adelscott, from Fischer. I love smoke beers with a passion, and you should too.
POSITIVE	Bottle in trade from ROBORB. Thanks man! Pours a rich dark black with a medium lived tan head. Smell is roasty malt, coffee and is quite nutty as well. Taste is very richly roasted, dark bitter chocolate, roasted coffee beans, bitter charred malt, and just really nice. A pretty substantial amount of bitterness either from the hops or the charred malt. Body is medium to full with medium carbonation. Damn tasty and easily one of the best porters I've had. How is this not a stout, and why is it not a year round beer?
NEGATIVE	Poured from a 22oz bottle into a US tumbler pint glass.  A: The beer is a murky brown color, with a very thin off-white head that fades very quickly and leaves almost no lace on the glass.  S: The aroma is of caramelized malts, some hops and some citrus.  T: The taste starts with sweet flavors of caramel, tea and citrus. Then a mild hops presence comes in and is pretty weak for the style but gets a little stronger as you continue to drink the beer. The malt character is hearty and there's a decent balance. The after-taste is slightly sweet.  M: Smooth and a little crisp, medium body, light-to-medium carbonation, finish is slightly sticky.  D: A little tasty, goes down ok, not too filling, decent kick, decent representation of style, it's not a bad beer but there are a lot of others in the style that I would pick first.
NEGATIVE	A variant of Mother Jones that contains raisins and molasses. Served in a 4oz taster glass at Haymarket.  A - Finger of tan foam with good retention settles to a thick collar and partial cap, leaving behind spotty lace. Hazy dark brown raisin body.  S - Raisins, roasted grains, dark fruits, Belgian yeast, candi sugar, but surprisingly low sweetness. Less medicinal and boozy than Mother Jones was.  T - More brown sugar and molasses present, with roasted grains, Belgian yeast, bread, and a surprisingly bitter licorice finish. Again, not overly sweet which is appreciated.  M - Dry, gritty, and roasty medium body. Alcohol isn't very noticeable. Carbonation is medium-low.  D - A mild improvement over the original. The surprising anise bitterness is a bit fatiguing. Again, dubbel isn't the style of beer of which I'd have multiple glasses. Still, if you're into the, give this a whirl.
POSITIVE	Pours hazy amber in color with a 2 finger creamy beige head that was full of bubbles and faded very slowly, leaving great foamy lacing clinging to the side and leaving rings; a nice looking IPA.   Smells of citrus hops, orange peel, grapefruit, pine cone or piney hops, lemon zest, grains, sweet malt, caramel, wet bread, light spices like pepper and coriander, and some herbs and/or floral hops. Nice balance in the nose, with hops being the strongest aroma, yet tamed by the malt and grains.    Tastes sweet and hoppy up front, with citrus hops, orange peel, grapefruit, pineapple, pine cone/piney hops, lemon zest, sweet malt, floral hops, flowers, herbs, grains, caramel, wet bread, light spices like pepper and coriander, brown sugar, and some oily resin that feels like a hop was just freshly squeezed into the mix. The citrus fruits give way to malty sweetness and the biscuity or wet bread flavor that then slides over the tongue with a fruity oily residue. Slightly bitter finish, like a glass of grapefruit juice that leaves off with toasted grains or some other fruit like an apple or pear, maybe even a grape. For me this is a definite session beer, as it was very hoppy but not over the top.  Mouthfeel is creamy, slick and smooth, with a medium body thats almost chewy, and little to no carbonation, with a zesty bitter finish that lets the citrus hops give you another kick before lingering for a while. The hop taste remains long after the beer is swallowed, which is the sign of a good IPA to me.   Great beer overall, it was very easy to drink on its own and I imagine it would pair well with food, particularly spicy food. Again, this is a session beer for me and another fine product from Founders that Ive been lucky to enjoy several times over the past year. A high recommendation to go out and enjoy this brew.
POSITIVE	I've now had this one from the bottle and on tap. Surprisingly they were not only different, but could be mistaken for a completely different beers. Both were outstanding in there own ways. For now I'll focus on the on-tap version.  Sampled repeatedly on-tap from the brewpub at Founders, this American double imperial pours a deep, unforgiving black with a mocha tan head that recedes to some spotty lace.  The aroma is intense. Some fruity, wine-like tannin qualities are present along with chocolate throughout. A bit of toastiness and some sweet black strap molasses.  A lot more mellow than the bottled version. Much less of the bourbon and smoke aspects, and a lot more decadent and sweet. Very sweet in fact with a lot of dark fruit. Sweet milk chocolate syrup and molasses; caramel, toffee, dark fruit, and a very nice warmth from the booze. Extremely sweet but so much that it takes away from the fabulous, deep complexities of this gem. Certainly something to sip and savor. A treat that I probably won't get another chance to experience for quite some time.   The mouthfeel is thick and syrupy. A velvet coating on the tongue with a juicy finish. Low carbonation. Absolutely exquisite. An intense and pleasurable beer experience. Easily worth the drive to Michigan.
NEGATIVE	22oz bottle purchased on a lark at Rocket Market on a trip to Spokane, WA.  The label description makes this sound like a Frankenstein beer with respect to style, but it holds together well. To my SF Bay Area palate, this is like a pleasant hybrid of Anderson Valley's Boont Amber and Anchor Steam.  Pours a deep reddish brown, medium-sized creme-colored head. Nose of very clean malt, sweet but not too sweet, not too dry, some slight pleasant dough. Taste is beautifully integrated - starts off sweet, but not at all cloying, sort of like a typical red ale. Turns a corner with some extraordinarily crisp English-style bitterness (is this the lagering?), maybe too much, since the sweetness doesn't really return on the finish, leaves a too-lingering dryness afterward.  But I like this beer. Would happily make it a regular drinker, like I already do Boont Amber and Anchor Steam. I'm now going to try to find out more about this brewery!
POSITIVE	A: Black. Thick, creamy, foamy tan head. Pour beautifully. I always forget just how dark this beer truly is.  S: Coffee. Sweet, delicious coffee. Some chocolate. Roasty notes. Great nose. Can't stop sniffing it.  T: Absolutely one of the best. Great coffee on the front end complimented perfectly on the back end by sweet, smooth, delicious chocolate. Even get a little malted milk ball character at the end (which I like a lot). Perfectly balanced. Outstanding.  M: Almost like drinking a thick, rich, iced coffee shake. Definitely a sipper. Coats the tongue and mouth beautifully, not cloyingly. Because it is heavy, 1-2 tops per sitting (if I could get that many) would do it for me.  Overall, like everyone else, I love this beer. It is between this and Terrapin WNB as to which is my favorite coffee stout. Can't go wrong with either one though. Founders, please come to TN!!!
POSITIVE	First review here guys, But I really enjoyed this beer.  Poured from a bottle into a pint glass  appearance: Dark black that poured like motor oil with no head  smell: You can tell there is a lot of coffee and a hint of chocolate   taste: Its not a sweet beer but you can taste the coffee and the chocolate.   mouthfeel: Solid mouthfeel. Not a lot of carbonation.  drinkability: The beer went down really well. I would like to compare this to the KBS. I really enjoyed this beer and will make sure I have some around to drink.
NEGATIVE	a pretty standard ale from cooperstown brewing. i can't really say anything bad about his one, but there's nothing definitively good about it either, save for the fact that it's a well made, easy drinking brew. a little hoppy, a little grainy and maybe a bit of caramel in both the smell and taste. there was nothing going on here that i was dissapointed in nor was there anything unexpected. a decent choice if your trying to ween someone off of heineken. even a bud drinker might be prone to enjoying this one.
POSITIVE	12-ouncer, bottled 8/5/09.  Pours opaque, with a modest mocha head. Lacing is decent, retention is average. Huge and earthy nose of coffee. I can smell the Sumatra.   Flavor is bitter, tangy and coffee-like. I like how this beer isn't sweet or timid. Roasty. Some chocolate comes through, but this brew really focuses on coffee and does it well. Oats could be more present and contribute more to the mouthfeel, which is a bit lacking for a stout on the bigger end of the spectrum.  This is a great coffee stout, and I respect it, but I don't see it as a top-25 beer, which is how it's rated (#22) on "Best of BA" as of this review. I'm not even sure it's top-50. Maybe I'm a curmudgeon. Who knows. Mikeller Beer Geek Breakfast is still the stuff for me when it comes to coffee stouts. This Founders brew is a great value though, especially when compared to Mikeller.
POSITIVE	On tap at Cambridge Brewing on 3/1/10.  A - Very hazy reddish orange liquid akin to cinnamon with half an inch of bubbly beige head that receded to a doughnut-shaped ring of retention then settled into a patchy film and spotty lace.  S - Superbly aromatic nose with a sweet, candy-like sugary character, prevalent borubon character and woody, oaky notes. Aroma is quite hoppy as well with hints of floral notes, fresh herbs and citrus fruit. Wow! There is even a lush vanilla sweetness that is just lovely. What a fantastic smelling beer!  T - Extraordinarily complex with lush vanilla notes and strong bourbon character as well as floral hop notes and a hint of citrus fruit. Malt is swet and sugary with a caramel presence. Oak character is restrained overall, keeping the dryness to a minimum. The citrus attributes really open up as the liquid warms up.  M - Medium bodied with a fairly syrupy texture and ample carbonation, but not too lively. Finishes with moderate alcohol warmth and bitterness on the palate.  D - Blunderbuss is definitely up there with the best barleywines I've encountered in my travels and boasts an amazing bourbon character that just hits the mark perfectly. This is a complex barleywine that remains extremely drinkable without becoming too warm or alcoholic in the process. Fabulous!
NEGATIVE	I can only wish a beer with this much character was released earlier in the winter. This is such a great beer to buy as late in the year as you can and hang on to it until it gets cold. Such a wonderful aroma as you open the bottle. It is heavy, but a good heavy. Don't try to eat dinner with it, just sit by the fire or in your ice shanty and enjoy.
POSITIVE	Sampled on-tap at the Sunset Grill in Boston.  This bock beer poured a clear, golden amber color with white foam that settled. The smell was malty: vinous Munich malt and biscuity malt. The taste was malty with light Munich malt flavor, but with a cereal grain flavor, and with a modest hoppiness in the finish. The mouthfeel was smooth and dry with full body and moderate carbonation. Overall it was dry but with a hint of sweetness. The aftertaste was also dry. This was fairly drinkable for its ABV, and the flavor grew on me.
POSITIVE	Thank you, John! I've been looking for this puppy for a while (well, not really, but still) Into my Duvel tulip  A: When decanted, this beer is a surprisingly light pale golden yellow with a finger-thick pure white head. There's a faint hint of haze but not much. Head retention and lacework are pretty good, there's a steady stream of visible carbonation to boot  S: Heady pine goodness, orange sweetness and a pleasant lightness to the body. There's a certain biscuit-like character to the malt that's unique and refreshing. Mildly floral, mildly spicy, this is a delicious smash-up of East and West-Coast style DIPAs  T: Opens up with some orange marmalade-like bitterness with plenty of hop flavor. Citrus, pine, mild floral notes and grapefruit dominate, with a mildly spicy/peppery note definitely present. Malt body is not really noticeable, this beer finishes hoppy and bitter, almost astringently so  M: Light in body with a great hop character both in bitterness and flavor, this beer is could exceptional. Mildly resiny with soft carbonation. Astringency on the finish is the only drawback  D: Enjoyable, it will put me to sleep. Would drink again
POSITIVE	Consumed and reviewed on 11/23/10.  Bottle poured into a Chimay chalice.   A: This beer pours nice and thin in the same dark brown, light black color as a can of Coca-Cola (we all remember what that looks like right?) Very light carbonation. If the light hits the glass just right, there's a nice deep red hue to the beer. It looks too good not to drink.  S: Noticeable bourbon aroma. It's not overpowering like other bourbon barrels... it's just strong enough to enjoy, but not strong enough to clear your sinuses with a nice strong whiff.   T: The best thing about this beer - as well it should be. Just like the smell, the bourbon is not overpowering.   M: Just the right amount of carbonation. No carbonated bite on the inside of your mouth. Let it sit in your mouth for just a second or two before swallowing and the bourbon taste lingers just long enough after every sip.  D: Can I have another please. Now!!! Yeah, it's that easy to drink. Small sips only please... "savor every morsel" as my momma used to say.
NEGATIVE	Found this a few months ago at Springhill Liquor. Looked interesting and foreign so I thought I would give it a try. Honestly, the biggest attraction for me was the $3 price tag and 9.5% ABV! A cheap drunk is a good drunk when your like me and on a budget. I bought it in conjunction with an Aiko.  Appearance: Pours a clear golden color with a white head that quickly dissipated. No real retention here.  Smell: Rich malty sweetness, very big sweetness.  Taste: Malty sweetness and...alcohol. That's about it. There are some other hidden flavors but they are very difficult to pick out. The malty sweetness is far too overpowering, along with the alcohol content of this brew.   Moutfeel: Ruined my palate for the rest of the night, with a the taste of rubbing alcohol, so kinda hard to judge.  Drinkability: If I'm homeless and looking for a cheap drunk, I'd pick this. It's a lot like a European hooker, cheap, loaded with alcohol, and no character.   Again, this reminds me of a poorly concocted Bock or Dubbel.  Cheers!  -Dotson
NEGATIVE	Another great beer courtesy of markwise. Pours amber with copper hues and thin white head. The aroma is full with molasses sweetness, maple syrup, a sense of boozy bourbon and some faint esteriness. The taste is pretty darn smooth to start and then ramps up with sweet molasses, maple syrup, bourbony sweetness, a light amount of coconut and a sense of wood. It ends a bit rough and dry due to some booziness.
NEGATIVE	hazed slightly orangey ruby brown with almost no head. fruity bubblegum aroma with coconut, vanilla, brown sugar, and a little yeast. a little bit of maltiness is detectable as well. lots of bubblegum in the taste, with coconut and vanialla. it's got a cidery quality that adds some sourness to the mix... malts show up at the end a little with a little caramel and pepper, followed by a little alcholic burn. pretty full mouthfeel with relatively active carbonation. decent drinkability... but it's pretty damn sweet like bubblegum apple cider. i'm giong to cellar the other two that i have and see if it improves, it just may.
POSITIVE	Bottle sample courtesy of Adil. I owe you big time! Pours a dense black with two fingers of bubbly, brownish tan head and globs of lacing on the snifter. Smell and taste are roasted malts, strong black coffee, dark bitter chocolate, cocoa, oatmeal, and creamy espresso. ABV is untraceable. I can see why they call this a "Breakfast Stout," as I could easily pour it on my cereal every morning. So delicious! Mouthfeel is rich and silky, fullish medium, toasted and dry coffee finish with a lingering bitterness. A divine imperial stout.
POSITIVE	New bottle design, the label now has Demeter, the Godess of Spring and Fertility on it.  Poured very nicely, good clean light amber colour with a solid white foaming head, which stayed for the whole pint.  Floral, slight hoppy aroma, nothing heavy, but pleasant and almost sweet.  The Maris Otter barley gives the whole beer a slightly sweetish flavour, which in my taste, gave it a weaker mouthfeel than I had hoped for. The beer is still very, very drinkable.
POSITIVE	Pours a thick head with a bright golden color. My sense of smell is weak and I will usually pick up strong scents; this beer doesn't cut through. Mouthfeel is watery, moderate carbonation. The hop taste is there at first but is quickly shot down by malt which dominates this beer. Finish is slightly bitter hops but also slightly metallic. Lacing is average to good. Overall I like this beer for the value. It is very drinkable, has a decent taste for the price of a regular macro. I didn't like the amber, so the other two would dictate whether I buy this again. Good choice for a party if you can't bear to serve the cheap stuff.
POSITIVE	Big thanks to Kegatron for hooking me up with this fine brew. Poured from a bomber (batch 01, bottled Sept 2011) into a shaped pint glass. The brew appears a hazed copper color that is hazed. Some golden coloration appears around the edges. 2.5 fingers worth of yellowish stained head sits atop the brew with a bold, uneven topping of froth. Patches and finger-like patterns of lace reach upward from the top of the liquid.  The smell of this brew is pretty darn nice. Pumpkin flesh is noted immediately with some green veggie character. A little bit of sulfur and some herbal hops keep this in check reminding you that this is in fact a beer. The herbal character of the hops plays a very nice contrast to the seemingly sweetness of the pumpkin flesh. More smells reveal a caramel hint of sweetness mixed with spices like nutmeg, cinnamon and maybe something a little brighter like ginger. This isn't the most pumpkin forward flavored brew I have had, but the mixture of character to the nose presents itself in a very pleasing and not too spiced aspect. Very well done.  The taste of this brew is earthy with pumpkin flavor that is a mixture of toasted quality and raw almost veggie aspects. The hops provide a nice amount of herbal bitterness which is enjoyable and really works that earthen feel throughout this flavor. Nutmeg is noted lightly mid palate and a bit of cinnamon comes into the finish that clashes a bit with the herbal bitterness. At times there is a bit of a fruity sweet alcohol touch. The grain inclusion is toasty with a bit of bready to biscuit attribute. The flavor that stays on the tongue right before the swallow is perfect, it is a perfect balance of pumpkin to spice ratio.  This is a medium bodied brew with a modest level of carbonation. This is quite a dry, herbal and bitter representation of the style which is quite enjoyable. As far as spicing goes, I think CBC has nailed this one perfectly. Any more spices and it would have been a bit distracting, any less and it just wouldnt have been enough to withstand the inclusion of the hops and grain. I am loving the level of alcohol in this one, its something I am happy to pour a second glass of. Thanks again Heath!
NEGATIVE	Served in a pint glass.  A- Dark caramel with a two finger head and a lot of lacing.  S- Not a lot in the nose. Caramel malt and roastiness. Pick up on some candy sugar and some other sweet additive.  T- Roasted malts, caramel, spices, a hint of coffee. Nice balance of bitterness to round this beer off.  M- Medium bodied, a little oily in texture with a nice mellow smooth finish.  O- Not a huge scotch ale guy, but this is a good one. The blend of sweet, roast, spice, and hops make this a very well balanced beer. You would never know this is 8.5%.
POSITIVE	A: Pours a deep, hazy amber-bronze color. The tall, tan-tinted head has a thick, frothy texture and strong retention. A plastering of soapy lacing adheres to the glass rather attractively.   S: A double dose of malts - some caramel along with an unmistakably spicy rye character. A firm citric (orange oil) hoppiness is complemented by some less noticeable herbal/floral hints.   T: A robust caramel malty sweetness is well balanced by a firm dose of spicy rye flavor. IPA-like hoppiness here. Vibrant citrus flavors with some lingering floral notes. Bitterness is fairly high.   M: Medium-full bodied. Carbonation is mild, lending a pleasantly creamy feel overall. A dry, spicy finish.   D: Another very nice beer from Founders. I've said it before, but rye works wonderfully in this style of beer, matched with some caramel maltiness and a big kiss of American hops. It's no Hop Rod Rye, but it's a most acceptable runner-up.
NEGATIVE	A- black body with a coffee colored head that became non-existant in a matter of a few minutes. not even a crown  S- roasted malt and alot of chocolate. tons of coffee in the nose also.  T- intensely dark and roasted. lots of chocolate, and a massive blast of coffee at the end.   M- the first thing i noticed about the mouthfeel is how smooth it is. decently thick too. upon the finish, the mouth is left very dry.  D- easy enough to finish. a bit too intense on the coffee to consider having more than one of these right now. im glad to see founders increasing their year round line up.
POSITIVE	Pours thick, midnight black apperance. Very slight head rims around top of glass. Spent coffee ground aroma with dull chocolate aroma. Faint tones of oak barrel. Sweet chocolate blends with dark coffee flavors. Some faint burbon comes on at the end with strong alchol that warms mouth. Drink finishes hot and boozie with Kalua like flavors Enjoyable mouthfeel, smooth and silkie medium body, close to heavy.  This one may need some time to age to let the alchol mellow out and let the other charecters peak. Look forward to trying another bottle in a year or so. As is, decent offering.
NEGATIVE	It poured a copper color/darker orange. It had a fluffy white head, that had some lacing. Smell was kind of fruity, taste was alright, a little sour, bitter and sweet all at the same time. Aftertaste wasn't too bad either. Little carbonation for mouthfeel and felt lighter and refreshing. Pretty good beer overall but not memorable.
POSITIVE	Picked up a bottle in Hickory NC, hooray beer!  PourS ink black with a sliver of caramel flavored head. Great viscosity, some lacing, zero head retention  S: Vanilla & dark fruit, opens up more as this warms  T: Licorice, dark choclate, much dryness, dark fruit & sour mash, herbal hops, carob up front. Dark fruit & leafy hops as this warms, rich dark chocolate & booze. Dryness & oakyness, vanilla, a touch of caramel in the finish  MF: Chewy, low carbonation, richer with each sip & warming as well  Drinks great for the style & ABV, not as good as BA Boris, but nice. Having said that, at the price they were selling in NC $20 a bomber, I can do much better closer to home ( Oak aged Yeti, Schafly IMP Stout or BLVD ImpStout for instance ) & for cheaper
NEGATIVE	Clear orange-copper, or weak iced-tea in color with fine foamy covering that leaves some nice lace.  Nice perfumy cascade-like aroma. Some citrus, pine and floral hops.  Assertively hoppy. Lots of woodsy pine and some citrus peel. Kinda astringent bitter finish.  Slightly stingy aggressive carbonation does not help the already astringent character of the beer.  Pretty drinkable, despite the astringent impression.
POSITIVE	Bottled 7/14/10, poured into a snifter. Seems like this release (accidental or not) snuck up on everyone. I didn't really enjoy 2009's super fresh and the description of this as a massive, malty and hoppy black barleywine keeps my expectations in check.  The beer is a deep, clear mahogany as it pours into the glass before settling in a near black, with a barely visible mahogany/blood red tint against light. A vigorous pour produces a fine, thick light khaki colored head that slowly fades to a thin cap and film. Leaves behind thin sheets of lacing that erode to a layer of splotchy dots across the glass. Almost looks like a stout.  Aroma is very rich and complex, remarkably not showing any booze or hotness. Very sweet (but not cloying) balance of dark fruits, malts, sugars and resiny hops. Also has a surprising underlying roasty and smoky aroma like a coffee stout.  Like the nose, I'm very surprised to find this is much more balanced and smooth so fresh (compared to the slight mess 2009 was). Front of the palate is dominated by a fruity and malty sweetness before becoming drier and more roasty as it moves back across the palate. Flavors initially leaned toward the roasty malt, almost bitter chocolate like stout, at cooler temperatutres, but as the beer warms a pleasant ripe fruitiness takes over (reminding me of their non-BA wheatwine). For a claimed over 100 IBU's there isn't much bitterness, particularly nothing like some other over the top American Barleywines.   Mouthfeel is my favorite part of the beer; an insanely thick, smooth and chewy body with slowly emerging fine bubbles of carbonation. Finish is ridiculously long lasting, and seemingly different each sip, bouncing back and forth between resiny hops, candied fruit sweet and roasty malt.  I'm very impressed with the drinkability of this two weeks after bottling. This is insanely smooth and balanced, with a robust and complex style-crossing body and flavor. I thought this was a stellar beer, but was slightly disappointed that this wasn't quite the same type of left field style obliterating beer that 2009 was (ok, I might exaggerate that point a bit, but you get the idea).
POSITIVE	Deep brown with amber highlites-a good sticky while minimal head that is accompanied by very ample lace. Strong in the aroma department with black coffee followed by a burst of hop-some sweet malt faintly chimes in. Big and rich in the mouth with a creamy viscous texture. Flavors run deep-caramel, dark chocolate, fruitcake, black licorice, and plenty of twangy hop to keep it interesting. The finish continues long and deep-the only way to stop the delightful lingering flavor would be to get out some grub. I can see this standing up to something rich and meaty-perhaps a dry aged hanger steak accompanied by some fries, and a side of super fresh, crispy vegies of choice. Or maybe a beef stew with plenty of potato, pea and carrot!? A great choice for a Winter Warmer!
POSITIVE	This is not a bad beer! I got this beer form a collegue who was in the region where they brew this beer. Best before july 2011.  Poured in a dutch beerglass the beer looks good. One and a half finger white head and a very nice golden yellow fluit WITH carbonation...i like that. The head disappears after two minutes but the carbonation stays.  Good smell, fresh and crispy. This is a better beer than i had out of this region.
NEGATIVE	A: dark, black, little bit of foamy head with minimal lacing.   S: starchy and smoky, cereals, very nice.  T: toasty, like browned grains. Unfortunately...  M: ... it's too fizzy. The carbonation really gets in the way of the taste. I want to let the rest of it go flat before I drink any more, so I can taste it.  O: I'll drink it again but there are other stouts and porters that I prefer. This could be really good aside from that distracting fizz.
NEGATIVE	Pours a quite cloudy, luscious dark caramel color. The thin head was a bit of a let down, but i'll let it slide because of the style.   Smells also of caramel, lots of malt, and just a hint of chocolate. A bit of apples, but it could just be the caramel's sweetness.   A big creamy malti-caramel body slides effortlessly onto your tongue and down your throat. Alcohol is almost un-perceived. A lingering hop bitterness provides an intriguing aftertaste which provokes an urge to take another sip.   Drinkability is good, not great. I don't think i would choose this over old chub. The best feature of this beer is the way the creamy mouthfeel complements the unoffensive smooth malt taste.
POSITIVE	12 oz bottle right at about 1-year old. Drank the other one I was lucky enough to get fresh last year. Pours viscous and black with some brown foam.  Nose is better than I remember with layers of chocolate, roast, toasted coconut, bourbon and vanilla-oak. Very nice.  Taste is smooth and oaky with a fair amount of bourbon. Mildly sweet, just about right for me. Light raisiny fruitiness adds some complexity. Coffee has died down quite a bit, as has the heat - bit of a tradeoff I suppose. I like this better at one year old than fresh. Much smoother and well integrated...a delicious beverage to be sure. I would seek this out again, no doubt. Although I must say (probably in the minority) that I enjoy the standard Breakfast Stout more than this.
POSITIVE	Sampled at the Bon Accord, Glasgow  Pours, surprise surpise, golden with a foamy white head and lovely foam on the glass. Quite a gorgeous looking beer actually. Fairly clean nose with a little fruitiness but not much of anything really. Some hop bite at fore followed by a mellow fruitiness with hints of apricot and pear leading to a slightly hoppy finish. Very smooth and heavy mouthfeel. A rather drinkable bitter, quite tasty.
POSITIVE	A serviceable porter. Black with tons of foam that was a delight on the palate. Nearly burnt coffee ground tarish aroma, sounds worse than it was. Average taste with significant burnt coffee bitter sediment, perhaps as it approached March expiration.
POSITIVE	A: Deep amber with a thin fuzzy head, wasn't too impressed.  S: Citrus is minimal, some sort of a bready/yeasty aroma. Malts are present but the bread like aroma is very strong. No hop presence. Just a malty amber.  T: Big malt backbone on the palate, brown sugar and bread dough. Some citrus but very muted. Almost has a brown ale flavor.  M: Very palatable, would be good for a bbq. Just crisp enough to make it refreshing.   D: Easily drinkable beer, good flavor but nothing overwhelming.
POSITIVE	On tap at Founders.  A: A mahogany maple syrup color, mostly translucent with light traces of a head.  S: Syrupy sweet, like caramel and burnt sugar, and boozy aromas too.  T: Sweeet and malty - some bourbon-like flavors, maple syrup, brown sugar, and no hoppy finish to it.  M: Just nice and in the middle - not too thick, mostly smooth.  D: So rich and sweet that it'd be hard to drink a lot of it, but it was an interesting sipping experience. I mostly liked it.
POSITIVE	On-tap (nitro) at The Bayou, SLC:  Pours brown ale with a thin head that stays. Some rings of lacing stick to the glass.  The smell is nutty and caramelish/toffeeish.  The taste is of roasted caramel, nuts, toffee, brown sugar with a citric touch in the finish. Nice maltiness with a touch of citric balance.  It has a thinnish, though medium, body.  This is a very nice traditional nutty brown ale with an American citrus touch. A goodie!
POSITIVE	One of my favorite stouts by far! Love to drink this for breakfast. (surprise surprise)  A - Pours black with a nice little head.  S - Smells like the perfect breakfast (Without the bacon). Coffee heavy and chocolate notes.  T - Thick, chocolatey taste. Loads of coffee and subtle oatmeal flavor.  M - Perfect stout feel. Nice and Creamy!
POSITIVE	10 oz pour at Memphis Tap Room, Fishington, Philly.  Medium brown with small head. Fantastic rauchbier aroma of sweet smoked meat and bacon. The thrid I have had from this brewery adn I have never been disappointed. The flavor is full on smokiness but surprisingly light. By memory I can't detect a lot of differemce from their Marzen. As with other rauchbiers from this brewery, amazingly drinkable...I don't get tired of this intense, wonderful smoky flavor. More!
POSITIVE	Light amber color, slightly sweetish fruity nose.  Very smooth and clean taste, with some malty sweetness balanced quite well with some flowery hop notes.  Super easy to drink.  Not overly full bodied, but still a certain richness.  You can tell it has a lot of quality brewed into it.  My first Stoudt's product and one that impressed me enough to definitely try the others.
POSITIVE	12 oz bottle poured at Belgique tasting, Hugo MN Thanksgiving 2010.  Dark ruby brew. Fine bubbles. Delicious tangy raspberry aroma, with an earthy leaf must underlying. Tart and extreme raspberry...incredible lack of any alcohol heat given the greater than 12% ABV. Brett provides a mushroomy flavor. A rich maltiness and slick and sticky mouthfeel. Truly a unique and fabulous brew!
NEGATIVE	Received from nlmartin. Thanks!  Fizzy off-white head composed of large bubbles. Reduced to a soapy layer that eventually disappeared. Clear, light copper color.  Caramel and some sweet bread malts in the nose. Mostly citrus hops with some bordering on tropical with some bubble gum and raw sugar. Fairly strong, but quite simple.  Pretty well balanced. Has a grainy, bread-like malt base. Citrusy hops and some piney notes. Hops are nearly as pronounced as the nose would suggest. Little hints of alcohol.  Body is a bit thin really with low carbonation. Overall seems a bit watery. Flavor lingers for a bit after the swallow.  Drinkability...ehh. Nothing overly noteworthy, but it goes down easy and it does taste like beer. Nothing wrong with it, just mediocre.
NEGATIVE	Tried a 2011 bottle on May 15 with two of my friends on our "Epic Beer Tasting Day". The line-up consisted of 2010 Darklord, Rare Bourbon County Stout, , 2011 Hanahpu, 2011 KBS, 2010 Abyss.  Appearance - It pours a very dark brown, almost black in appearance. Had a very thin mocha colored head that quickly disappears.  Smell - Bourbon? Nope I didn't smell any of that. I smelled mostly burnt coffee/caramel and nothing else. Disappointing to say the least.   Taste - The alcohol is just too overwhelming in this. I couldn't taste anything but alcohol. I thought it would have a wonderful balanced flavor of coffee, chocolate, vanilla, and bourbon, but got nothing of it.  Mouthfeel - Very thick as it coats your whole mouth and burns your throat as it goes down. Not a pleasant experience at all.  Overall - Overrated! Very disappointed.
POSITIVE	I had a pint of this at Hopjacks Pizza Kitchen & Taproom on Sunday, September 25, 2011. I specify the date as this beer was phenomenal. I have had it in the past but is seems that this new brewery had hit the nail on the head and perfected its recipe.   A: nice hazy golden color with nice head that stuck around for awhile, good lacing on the glass.  S: this is always my weakest review as I typically have stuffed sinuses...some detections of citrus, hops, wheat.  T: delicious, this rivals some very well known IPAs and is on point for an IPA as far as style characteristics. Had the citrus peel/grapefruit flavor, lots of hops, spices nice refreshing drink.  M: I had ridden my bicycle to the pub and needed a refreshing drink, this hit the spot. Crisp, full of effervescence.   Overall: I have had this beer several times now and this was the best batch thus far. Hope the brewery will be consistent as this could be the beer that launches a thousand barrels. Also hope they start bottling soon. Great job guys.
NEGATIVE	12 oz brown longneck with no freshness dating.  Poured in my SA pint glass, the beer is a hazy brown with gold highlights. There is a huge beige head & decent lacing.  The aroma is of smoky malts, some berries and brown sugar.  First taste is berries followed rapidly by the peaty malts. The berries flavor is neither overwhelming or artificial. More berries in the aftertaste and the beer sweetens. I'd like a little more robust scotch ale as the base for this one.   The mouth is solid. Drinkablity is tougher. Would I drink all night, no. Would I drink occasionally, yes. Interesting combo is worth searching out.
NEGATIVE	A - A bright red with a maroon-amber hue; minimal light tan head but it has very good lacing.  S - Just a great aroma; smells of plum, dark cherry in their purest form; malt and chocolate; molasses/brown sugar smell aroma; you can smell the alcohol.  T - Taste follows the nose and more. Strong flavor of dark fruits that are sugary and coated. A little bit yeasty. A nice hop effect that is pleasantly surprising for this style. Scotchy alcoholic aftertaste. This is a great scotch ale.   M - Excellent. Whole; the sticky head accompanies each sip with an exceptional swallow. Low to medium carbonation.   D - Drinkable but it has a high ABV and is pretty heavy. Two of these and you'll be good for the night. I wouldn't call it sessionable, therefore.   One of the best beers I've had to date. This is a style I'm pretty unfamiliar with in my young beer drinking days, but this shit is TASTY!
POSITIVE	Sampled on tap at Redbones.  This marzen style beer poured a clear, copper color with white foam that settled. The smell was a mild, slightly sweet malty aroma. The taste was slightly sweet (but less sweet than many other of this style) and tangy, malty, with the hops making their presence felt in the finish. There was also a bit of a dry, oaky flavor. The mouthfeel was smooth and creamy up front, but with a dry finish. The body and carbonation were medium. The aftertaste was dry and lingered nicely. This was a good oktoberfest beer.
POSITIVE	Pours a black body with a brown head that very quickly fizzles away to a thin brown lace.  Aroma smells of coffee beans, bourbon, chocolate, malt.  Taste a lot of bourbon and coffee right off the bat. Then, hints of chocolate and something very sweet like a syrup. After letting the beer settle I find the flavors come more together as it warms up. An incredibly tasty stout.  Mouthfeel is very impressive. Thick, but not too thick with a velvet like feel.  This beer is heavy and fills you up, also 11.20% so its not a beer you need to drink a whole lot of. Still though, you might find it hard to pass up another glass.  Overall this beer is one of the best stouts i'm yet to have.
POSITIVE	A nice sweet, malty beer...nothing complex, just a smooth refreshing drink that reveals no hint of 8.3 abv.  Pours an ice-tea colored brown. If held to the light, the very center of the beer is dense. Lots of light comes through on the sides. Tan head is average size with poor retention. Good lacing. Smell and taste are of caramel malts. Must be balanced very well because it is quite sweet but not cloying or too sweet for mass consumption. Mouthfeel is thick and rich. Drinkability is good. I finished off the 12 oz bottle quickly and could have enjoyed more.  This is one you have to be in the mood for, but if you are looking for something well made and sweet, this will do it for you.

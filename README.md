An analysis on the quality of romantic relationships

Overview:
Because divorce or separation is a fear many individuals have, we concluded it would be in our interest to investigate how different aspects of a romantic partner relate to the overall quality of the relationship. The information of romantic partners we used includes household income, education, whether or not they used the internet when dating, sexual orientation, and racial demographic. We used loyalty between partners, a high sex frequency, and a high self rating of the quality in one's relationship as benchmarks to determine a high quality relationship. Using these assumptions as a form of qualitative measurements, we judged the quality of relationships as part of our analysis. Poor quality relationships could be a result of certain aspects between romantic partners and our goal for this analysis is to discover how these aspects compare to one another when determining the quality of relationships.

Research Question:
What factors predict the highest quality romantic relationship? Between household income, level of education, whether or not a couple used the internet while dating, sexual orientation, and racial demographic, which is the best predictor of the highest quality romantic relationship?

Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that education level will be the biggest factor to consider between couples when measuring the quality of their relationship. This is due in part to a high education level being associated with a more reliable income, leading to a more stable relationship. 

Background & Prior Work:
A number of organizations have aimed to understand how personal qualities may contribute to the overall quality of a relationship. For instance, the dataset we are using is from Rosenfeld, Michael J., Reuben J. Thomas, and Sonia Hausen. 2019 How Couples Meet and Stay Together 2017 Fresh Sample. Stanford, CA: Stanford University Libraries. This research used a questionnaire to ask random couples about their use of online dating services and 3500 participant data points were collected from couples answering the questionnaire. For background information, we noticed in the book Cyberspace Romance: The Psychology of Online Relationships, authors Monica Whitty and Adrian Carr theorize that the world of cyberspace might prove to be more freeing than the real world for dating, allowing participants to be more experimental when approaching relationships. They also note that individuals might be more “comfortable presenting different aspects of themselves in different spaces online” [1] However, A study from 2006 claims that those participating in virtual relationships reported significantly lower intimacy on the Stenberg and Rubin Scales eventually stating that “relationships that develop online are not likely to result in greater intimacy than the levels experienced by individuals in their face-to-face relationships.” [2] 

Ethics and Privacy:
The dataset [3] used in this study is on public display, found online through Stanford University’s Social Science Data Collection. All participants were 18 years of age or older and provided consent to participate in the survey used for this study. An oversample of LGBT couple information was taken to provide further insight on minority sexual orientation groups. All responses have been removed of identifiable information, prior to being on public display. Because our data analysis team did not have direct contact with those participating in the questionnaire or the team gathering the data, this further protects the privacy of the participants. The implications of this study may have effects on dating app companies, either raising or decreasing popularity, based on our findings. This would affect any stakeholders in the online dating industry. The data are nationally representative, as GfK recruits subjects into the panel by phone and by Address Based Sampling, and subjects without Internet access at home are given Internet access. Personal biases that may have an effect on how this study is conducted is our group’s minimal personal experience with online dating.

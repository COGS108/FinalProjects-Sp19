An analysis on the quality of relationships

1. Introduction and Background
For college students looking for meaningful relationships, often the most tried method is to use dating apps. We concluded that it would be in our interest to investigate the relationship between online dating services and the quality of the relationships that results from them in order to help navigate the current dating climate. This leads us to 

Research Question:
How can people have the highest quality romantic relationship?

Hypothesis:
There is a positive correlation between the use of online tools used for the onset of a romantic relationship and the quality of said relationship.


Data
For instance, the dataset we are using is from Rosenfeld, Michael J., Reuben J. Thomas, and Sonia Hausen. 2019 How Couples Meet and Stay Together 2017 Fresh Sample. Stanford, CA: Stanford University Libraries. This research used a random questionnaire to ask couples about their use of online dating services and 3500 participant data points were collected from couples answering the questionnaire. We can conclude from this high popularity that people are turning to online dating to supplement their current dating methods, or to exclusively meet potential dating partners.

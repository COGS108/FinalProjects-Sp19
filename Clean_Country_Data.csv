Al Terry,Watch Dog,1960-02-29,1960-02-29,"

If you see a baby that you think would suit me
Turn around and run her down and chase her back to me
Watch dog, watch dog
If you can do what I think you can do for me
I'll give you a home
When I have to leave the house and baby wants to play
Don't ever sleep, be sure you keep everyone away
Watch dog, watch dog
If you can do what I think you can do for me
I'll give you a home
You won't have to chase around for rabbits in the cold
All I want from you is just to do what you are told
If a stranger comes around when I'm away from home
Just be sure he gets the fear and leave my chicks alone
When my baby kisses me, it knocks me off my heels
When a rabbit slaps you down, you know just how I deal
Watch dog, watch dog
If you can do what I think you can do for me
I'll give you a home
When I have to leave the house and baby wants to play
Don't ever sleep, be sure you keep everyone away
Watch dog, watch dog
If you can do what I think you can do for me
I'll give you a home
You won't have to chase around for rabbits in the cold
All I want from you is just to do what you are told
If a stranger comes around when I'm away from home
Just be sure he gets the fear and leave my chicks alone
When my baby kisses me, it knocks me off my heels
When a rabbit slaps you down, you know just how I deal
Watch dog, watch dog
If you can do what I think you can do for me
I'll give you a home

Anne Murray,A Stranger In My Place,1971-03-22,1971-05-31,"

I see the town
Where we were born
I see the place
We were raised
I see all the things you wanted
That I never gave
I see sadness
I see sorrow
I see pain in your face
But I just can't see
A stranger in my place
I can see now
Where we quarrelled
I can see now I was wrong
I can see where you might weaken
When I wasn't strong
I see mem'ries of a love gone bad
That time cannot erase
But I just can't see
A stranger in my place
No one seems to know you quite like I do
No one knows the things
That make you cry
Looking back it seems
I never showed you
And now I lay alone
And wonder why
I can see now
Where you might grow tired of dreams
That don't come true
I can see where
I have fallen short
Of the things I promised you
I can see now through
My tear filled eyes no love on your face
But I just can't see a stranger in my place

Anne Murray,Cotton Jenny,1972-01-31,1972-04-24,"

There's a house on a hill
By a worn down weathered old mill
In a valley below where the river winds
There's no such thing as bad times

And a soft southern flame, oh Cotton Jenny's her name
And she wakes him up when the sun goes down
And the wheel of love goes round
Wheels of love go round, love go round
Love go round, a joyful sound

He ain't got a penny for Cotton Jenny to spend
But then the wheels go round

When the new day begins, he goes down to the cotton gin
And he makes his time worth while to then
Then he climbs back up again
And she waits by the door, oh Cotton Jenny he's sore
And she rubs his feet while the sun goes down
And the wheel of love goes round
Wheels of love go round, love go round
Love go round, a joyful sound

He ain't got a penny for Cotton Jenny to spend
But then the wheels go round
Wheels of love go round, love go round
Love go round, a joyful sound

He ain't got a penny for Cotton Jenny to spend
But then the wheels go round
Wheels go round
Wheels go round
Love go round
Love go round
Love go round

Anne Murray,Danny's Song,1973-01-08,1973-04-09,"

People smile and tell me I'm the lucky one
And we've just begun
I think I'm gonna have a son
He will be like him and me, as free as a dove
Conceived in love
The sun is gonna shine above

And even though we ain't got money
I'm so in love with you honey
Everything will bring a chain of love
And in the morning when I rise
Bring a tear of joy to my eyes
And tell me everything's gonna be all right

Love a guy who holds the world in a paper cup
Drink it up
Love him and he'll bring you luck
And if you find he helps your mind, better take him home
Yeah, and don't you live alone
Try to earn what lovers own

And even though we ain't got money
I'm so in love with you honey
Everything will bring a chain of love
And in the morning when I rise
Bring a tear of joy to my eyes
And tell me everything's gonna be all right

And even though we ain't got money
I'm so in love with you honey
Everything will bring a chain of love
And in the morning when I rise
Bring a tear of joy to my eyes

Anne Murray,He Thinks I Still Care,1974-05-13,1974-05-13,"

Just because I ask a friend about him
Just because I spoke his name somewhere
Just because I rang his number by mistake today
He thinks I still care

Just because I haunt the same old places
Where the memory of him lingers everywhere
Just because I'm not the happy girl I used to be
He thinks I still care

And if he's happy thinking I still need him
Then let that silly notion bring him cheer
But how could he ever be so foolish?
Or where would he get such an idea?

Just because I ask a friend about him
Just because I spoke his name somewhere
Just because I saw him, then went all to pieces
He thinks I still care

Yes, he thinks I still care

There's a wren in a willow wood
Flies so high and sings so good
And he brings to you what he sings to you

Like my brother the wren and I
Well, he told if I try, I could fly for you
And I wanna try for you 'cause

I wanna sing you a love song
I wanna rock you in my arms all night long
I wanna get to know you
I wanna show you the peaceful feelin' of my home

Summer thunder on moon-bright days
Northern Lights and skies ablaze
And I bring to you, lover, when I sing to you

Silver wings in a fiery sky
Show the trail of my love and I
Sing to you, love is what I bring to you

And I wanna sing to you, oh

I wanna sing you a love song
I wanna rock you in my arms all night long

Anne Murray,SNOWBIRD,1970-08-10,1970-11-23,"

Beneath this snowy mantle cold and clean
The unborn grass lies waiting
For its coat to turn to green
The snowbird sings the song he always sings
And speaks to me of flowers
That will bloom again in spring

When I was young
My heart was young then, too
Anything that it would tell me
That's the thing that I would do
But now I feel such emptiness within
For the thing that I want most in life's
The thing that I can't win

Spread your tiny wings and fly away
And take the snow back with you
Where it came from on that day
The one I love forever is untrue
And if I could you know that I would
Fly away with you

The breeze along the river seems to say
That he'll only break my heart again
Should I decide to stay
So, little snowbird
Take me with you when you go
To that land of gentle breezes
Where the peaceful waters flow

Spread your tiny wings and fly away
And take the snow back with you
Where it came from on that day
The one I love forever is untrue
And if I could you know that I would
Fly away with you

Yeah, if I could I know that I would
Fl-y-y-y-y away with you

[Chorus]
Hey hey hey, what about me?
I've got some feelings on my mind, too
Hey hey hey, what about me?
I'd like to have a song to sing, too

Please let me in when you're singing your song
And I'll just sit quiet, I won't try to sing along
You've got the warmest place that I've ever found
Please let me in, and I won't make a sound

(Chorus)
But, don't you ask me to give you a song
I won't know the words to use, I won't know where they belong
But if you give me one of yours, I will make it my own
And it would be the sweetest song that I have ever known

I'd like to have a song to sing, too

Anthony Armstrong Jones,Take A Letter Maria,1970-01-12,1970-03-09,"

[Verse 1]
Last night as I got home
About a half past ten
There was the woman I thought I knew
In the arms of another man

I kept my cool
I ain't no fool
Let me tell you what happened then
I packed some clothes
And I walked out
And I ain't coming back again

[Chorus]
So, take a letter, Maria
Address it to my wife
Say I won't be coming home
Gotta start a new life

So, take a letter, Maria
Address it to my wife
Send a copy to my lawyer
Gotta start a new life

You've been many things
But most of all
A good secretary to me
And it's times like this I feel
That you'll always be close to me

And was I wrong to work nights
To try to build a good life
All work and no play
Has just cost me a wife

[Chorus]
So, take a letter, Maria
Address it to my wife
Say I won't be coming home
Gotta start a new life
So, take a letter, Maria
Address it to my wife
Send a copy to my lawyer
Gotta start a new life

[Verse 2]
When a man loves a woman
It's hard to understand
That she would find more pleasure
In the arms of another man

Maria, I never really noticed
Just how sweet you are to me
It just so happens I'm free tonight
Would you like to have dinner with me?

[Chorus 2x]
So, take a letter, Maria
Address it to my wife
Say I won't be coming home
Gotta start a new life

So, take a letter, Maria
Address it to my wife
Send a copy to my lawyer
Gotta start a new life

So, take a letter, Maria
Address it to my wife
Say I won't be coming home

Autry Inman,Ballad Of Two Brothers,1968-10-28,1969-01-27,"

Somewhere in Vietnam, September first
Dear, Mom and Dad
We must've marched twenty miles today
Through the rain and the mud
And believe it or not
This is the first opportunity
I've had to sit down and
Write in two or three weeks
This'll have to be short
But I just wanted to send my love
And let you know that I'm doing fine
But you know, just being here
And seeing how close these people
Are to losing their freedom
Makes me that much more determined
To help win this war
'Cause if we don't, the next battlefield
May be closer to home than Vietnam
Must close for now, all my love
Your son, Bud
P.S., how's Tommy doing
At State University
Tell him his big brother said hello
State University, September first
Hi, Dad, we must have
Marched twenty blocks today
And, baby, I'm beat
I mean, like the sign
I was carrying got real heavy
But, Dad, everything was out of sight
There were recorders and
Photographers and cameraman
From every major news
Service and network in the nation
So look for your baby boy's picture
On the front page of today's paper
Of course, you might have a
Little trouble recognizing me
With my groovy beard
But, Dad, I know we're right
How can you defend my brother
Murdering all those people overseas
So what if the Communists
Do take over in South Vietnam
Why, just today
Our economics professor assured us
That people get along
Just as well under communism
As they do under
Any other form of government
I'm sorry, Dad
But this God and country bit
Just isn't my bag
Gotta go, dad, big rally tonight
Your son, Tommy
P.S., Dad better send me an
Extra fifty bucks this week, dig
Dear Mr. and Mrs. Smith
I know you must be awfully
Proud of your fine son
I wish I could be there to
See you recieve Bud's medal of honor
It may comfort you to know
That his last thoughts were of you
And as his sergeant
I can truthfully say
He was one of the bravest men
I have ever known
Dear Mom and Dad
It's been some time
Since I received word about Bud
Somehow I just didn't have
The nerve to come home
But I've done a lot of thinking since then
About my turned on friends and
About what they said about communism
We were all wrong
And you know, I always just worship Bud
Now that I've thought it over, I know
That he would never fight for something
Unless he believed in it
With all of his heart
And in spite of all my past mistakes
I hope that somehow, someday
I can become as big in your eyes
As my brother will always be
Your son, Private Tommy Smith

Barbara Fairchild,Kid Stuff,1973-08-06,1973-11-05,"

I often think of younger days
A boy, a girl and backyard play
I'd get hurt, you'd get your way
And they called it kid stuff
I know it mattered little then
The childish games you'd always win
Now the stakes are higher
And it's no longer kid stuff

[Chorus]
Kid stuff when I was little
Was sitting in the middle
Of a cotton candy world
But now my heart is saying
This is no game we're playing
For I can see I'm losing you
To another world
I remember very well
Plan we made by a wishing well
And secret stuff we couldn't tell
Ain't that just like kid stuff
And I always thought
That you'd be mine
At least until the end of time
I wore your ring that cost a dime
Happiness is kid stuff

[Repeat Chorus]
I'm losing you
To another world

I wish I had button eyes and red fat nose
Shaggy cotton skin and just one set of clothes
Sittin' on the shelf in the local department store
With no dreams to dream and nothing to be sorry for

I wish I was a Teddy Bear
Not livin' nor lovin' or goin' nowhere
I wish I was a Teddy Bear
And I'm wishin' that I hadn't fallen in love with you

I wish I had a wooden heart and a sawdust mind
Then your mem'ry wouldn't come around hurtin' all the time
I'd have a sewed on smile and a painted twinkle in my eye
And I never would've ever had to learn how to cry

I wish I was a Teddy Bear
Not livin' nor lovin' or goin' nowhere
I wish I was a Teddy Bear
And I'm wishin' that I hadn't fallen in love with you

I wish I had a string you'd pull to make me say
Hi, I'm Teddy ain't it a lovely day
Then I'd know every time I spoke the words were right
And no one would know the mess I made in my life

I wish I was a Teddy Bear

And I'm wishin' that I hadn't fallen in love with you

If you want a do right all day's woman you gotta be a do right all night's man
Take me to heart and I'll always love you and nobody can make me do wrong

She's not just a plaything she's flesh and blood just like her man
If you want a do right all day's woman you gotta be a do right all night's man

They say it's a man's world but you can't prove that by me
As long as we're together baby show some respect for me

You've got to give a little take a little if you want to get a little lovin'
And do all the things that make your man feel right
And if you give a little take a little then you're gonna get a lotta lovin'
And you're never gonna ever have to spend another lonely night

If he needs a little lovin' then hold him
Cause if you don't the fires of love are gonna get a little cold and dim
And if his day don't go your way then take it with a little smile
After all it's the ups and downs of love that makes it all worthwhile
You've got to give a little...

Never mind the times when his feet feel the need for freedom
Just as long as they bring him on home to you when you need him
To show you care you gotta be there when he laughs or when he cries
There's no mistaking givin' and talking is the very best part of life
You've got to give a little...
You've got to give a little...

[Chorus]
Oop shoop moogi mushy doggy, oh
Oop shoop moogi ay
Means son, don't go near the Eskimos
Please do what I say

My daddy was working
For the weather station
A little bit North of Nome
And I grew up in that frozen country
Where the nights are six months long

I used to play like I was an Eskimo
I put whale oil on my hair
And every night I would beg my folks
Let me sleep in the frigid air

I was seventeen and my voice was changing
But the girls didn't thrill me none
'Cause I longed to go see an Eskimo
On the banks of the old Yukon

One night I slipped from my daddy's house
A little bit north of Nome
I knew that I could get back by morning
'Cause the nights are six months long

And there she was
Sitting on a chunk of ice
Eating a frozen fish
And dipping her friskies
In whale blubbe

And I said, ooga shooga mooshka
Which means the love in my heart
Is a burning

And she said, ooga mooshka nooshka
And that means, back up, buddy
You're melting the ice

I went back home and I told my daddy
About this maiden fair
And how I felt I'd love to melt
Them icicles in her hair

Dad's trembling lips turned purple
And his breath began to freeze
It was then he told me
I could never rub noses
With pretty little Um Shog Nee

He said, son, when you were born
Well, the Eskimo and the white man
Were having a lot of wild parties, see
The Eskimos always brought the ice

Well, they's having a lot of fun, you see
So one night, this Eskimo named Pie Eye
That's right, son, a pie-eyed Eskimo
He stole my little boy and made
A icicle out of him

So I stole you to get even
I was gonna make a
Fudgesicle out of you

But I loved you like you's my very own
And I treated you just, you know
Just like the cold blooded
Little Eskimo that you are

So you see, son, you can never
Rub noses with Um Shog Nee no more
Because, excuse me, see, Um Shog Nee
Has the coldest nose in Alaska
And that's why I've always say

Put it off until tomorrow oh oh you've hurt me enough today
You say our love is over that you have found another
You say you're going away
But leave me tomorrow oh oh you've hurt me enough today
You've hurt me enough today I can't believe the words you say
I must accept the fact you won't be coming back
So stay just one more day loneliness isn't far away
Put it off until tomorrow oh oh you've hurt me enough today
So stay just one more day...

He's got more love in his little finger than you've got in all your heart
He's got more love in his little finger than you've got in your whole heart
And when you leave off in tenderness that's where his tenderness starts
Oh he wouldn't lie to me not to save his life that's something he just wouldn't do
He's got more love in his little finger more love that is off of you
He's everything a man should be he's kind he's good and he's true
And when I look into his eyes there's a love light that was missing in you
Just one sweet kiss that's all I need tell me we'll never part
He's got more love in his little finger than you've got in all your heart
He's got more love in his little finger than you've got (you've got )
Than you've got (you've got) than you've got in all your heart

Knowing how you want and need me with just one look
To leave you now is something you should know that I can't do

Long enough to know that what I feel won't go away
Just looking won't be near enough after today
Everything I need is everything I see in you
I stayed long enough to fall in love with you

Long enough to know...

Big Jimmy Baker and Marty Gray met at a teenage party
Jimmy took Marty to school the next day both of them were tardy
Sittin' in the parking lot talking over things waitin' for the morning bell to ring
Two little love birds loose on wing Jimmy Baker and Marty
Kids in love now what can you do but listen to the cooing
Pretty little blonde haired Marty Gray does your mama know what you're doing
Bet your mama don't know what you're doing

Big Jimmy Baker's on the football team Marty's wearin' his sweater
Listen to them talking in the locker room man he's a real go getter
Telling Marty bout the facts of life says there'll never be another
Someday she's gonna be his wife he learned that line from his brother
Kids in love now what can you do...

Down at the drive-in Friday night didn't come to see the movie
Parked in back and away from the light Jimmy says isn't this groovy
Under the seat a bottle in a bag made to affect the senses
Poured out a drink for Marty Gray broke down her defense
Kids in love now what can you do...

Big Jimmy Baker and Marty Gray no longer goin' together
Fire of love burned out they say Marty's feelin' under the weather
Town turns out to have a big day the football hero's goin' away
But Marty's got the price to pay and Jimmy's gonna let her
Kids in love now what can you do...
Bet your mama don't know what you're doing

I left Garden City Kansas with a ticket and a yen to see New York
I typed eigty words a minute so your corporation let me go to work
I fetch paper clips and coffee even help you dodge your domineering wife
Mr Walker it's all over I don't like the New York secretary's life

In this building there's a crowd of guys with old familiar thoughts upon their minds
That's a lot of hands a reaching out you grab the things that I consider mine
And the president persues me even though he's old and hair a turnin' white
Mr Walker it's all over I don't like the New York secretary's life

There's a flat in Greenwich Village that I took because the subway wasn't far
But a trumpet player's upstairs and below me ther's a jumping all night bar
And to frost a bitter cake I have to share the place with bugs and big ol' mice
Mr Walker it's all over I don't like the New York secretary's life

Your sweetheart in personnel said I should give her written notice like the rest
So I wrote goodbye with my brightest lipstick right across her big expensive desk
You'd better call the Times and tell 'em put your wanted ad right back in classified
Mr Walker it's all over I don't like the New York secretary's life

There's a Greyhound at the station and a mom at home with open arms for me
Garden City's looking better every minute now since I have learned to see
And the boy next door don't know it but come June he's gonna gain himself a wife

Stepchild you've had a hard way to go
How come your daddy run away your mama never did know
All you remember is becoming a step son to your mama's new man
And you got aquainted with the back of his hand
Stepchild you say the man had a son
The son called him daddy but he told you to call him John
You say the legs on the breast of the chicken was gone
When the platter come around your way
And you had to chop cotton while your step brother played
Stepchild when you were born
Your right foot was turned left with your left
And mercy had a way of taking off and leaving you by yourself
Stepchild muddy water got in your well

Stepchild how come your laughing that way
After doing the deed that you've done you better learn how to pray
Stepchild you've got a weird sense of humor
And you came close to gettin' away
But they caught you plantin' garlic on your step daddy's grave
Stepchild when you were born...

Billy Edd Wheeler,Ode To The Little Brown Shack Out Back,1964-11-23,1965-05-03,"

They passed an ordinance in the town
They said we'd have to tear it down
That little old shack out back
So dear to me

Though the health department said
It's day was over and dead
It will stand forever in my memory

Don't let 'em tear that
Little brown building down
Don't let 'em tear that
Precious building down

Don't let 'em tear that
Little brown building down
For there's not another like it
In the country or the town

It was not so long ago that
I went tripping through the snow
Out to that house behind
My old hound dog

Where I'd sit me down to rest
Like a snowbird on his nest
And read the Sears and Roebuck catalog

I would hum a happy tune
Peeping through the quarter moon
As my daddy's kin had done before

It was in that quiet spot
Daily cares could be forgot
It gave the same relief
To rich and poor

Don't let 'em tear that
Little brown building down
Don't let 'em tear that
Precious building down

Don't let 'em tear that
Little brown building down
For there's not another like it
In the country or the town

Now it was not a castle fair
But I could dream my future there
And build my castles to
The yellow jacket's drone

I could orbit around the sun
Fight with General Washington
Or be a King upon a golden throne

It wasn't fancy built at all
It had newspapers on the wall
It was air conditioned
In the wintertime

It was just a humble hut
But it's door was never shut
And a man could get inside
Without a dime

Don't let 'em tear that
Little brown building down
Don't let 'em tear that
Precious building down

Don't let 'em tear that
Little brown building down
For there's not another like it
In the country or the town

A living in a time of stress
Disappointments all around us
And very little happiness

We're living in an age of worry
A living in a time of fear
Life goes by in such a hurry
Tension mounting year by year

We're living in an age of danger
No peace of mind to feed the soul
The whole world is quick to anger
Greed and power is its goal

Somewhere there's got to be a rainbow
In God to heaven up above
I'll keep looking for that rainbow
And I'll keep searching for his love

Disappointments all around us

Cause he had you and everything tied with a golden thread
Then Charlie left and went away and when I got the news
It wasn't long till I was walking round in Charlie's shoes

Now I'm wearing out the shoes that Charlie wore
Walking back and forth across the floor
The troubles that drove him away I've got for company
These nights in Charlie's shoes are killing me

The greener grass that turned my head so swiftly did turn brown
Cause every little dream I build she's always tearing down
I never knew old Charlie's shoes could have so many tacks
Of disappointing sorrows and I wish he had 'em back

Remains with me though there'll never be another

When two blue people were the victim of circumstances

Circumstances the wrong arms the right time
Circumstances was it charms or just the wine
Would it happen again if we had enough chances
Or would we even want each other under different circumstances

What is done is over and just a memory
The night they set a sign for you and me
Oh but the dreams this foolish heart romances
When two blue people were the victim of circumstances

Circumstances the wrong arms the right time
Circumstances was it charms or just the wine
Would it happen again if we had enough chances
Or would we even want each other under different circumstances

On the Chisholm trail, it was midnight
Carmela was strong on his mind
Because of the life he had chosen
Carmela had left then behind

Too long he'd been a bandito
Carmela had left him alone
But today someone brought a message
She'd be seen in old San Antone

Cross the Brazos at Waco
Ride hard and I'll make it by dawn
Cross the Brazos at Waco
I'm safe when I reach San Antone

He glanced back over his shoulder
The posee was nowhere in sight
He'd sent for Carmela to meet him
On the banks of the Brazos tonight

She was waiting and he kept the promise
He'd made such a long time ago
As he dropped the guns that she hated
In the mighty Brazos below

Cross the Brazos at Waco
Ride hard and I'll make it by dawn
Cross the Brazos at Waco
I'll walk straight in old San Antone

Then the night came alight with gun fire
He knew that at last he'd been found
As the ranger's band shoot brightly
El bandito laid on the ground

Carmela knew he was dying
That all of her dreams were in vain
As she kissed his lips for the last time
She heard him whisper again

Cross the Brazos at Waco
Ride hard and I'll make it by dawn
Cross the Brazos at Waco
I'm safe when I reach San Antone

I'm safe when I reach San Antone

That's good as any joke I've heard
It seems that since I've seen you last
I done forgot the meaning of the words

If happiness is empty rooms and drinking in the afternoon
Well I suppose I'm happy as a clown
But if it's got a thing to do with smiling or forgetting you
Well I don't guess that I can say I am

Did you ever see a down and outer waking up alone
Without a blanket on to keep him from the dew
When the water from the weeds has soaked the paper
He's been putting in his shoes to keep the ground from coming through

And his future feels as empty as the pocket in his pants
Because he's never seen a single dream come true
Well that's the way that I've been feeling
Since the day I started falling
From the bottle to the bottom stool by stool
Learning how to live with losing you

You wonder if I'm better off with freedom
Now to do the things I choose
Well all my times my own and I got nothing left
But sleeping time to lose

There's no one here to carry on if I stay out the whole night long
Or give a tinkers damn if I don't call
I'm living like I wanted to and doing things I wanna do
And nothing seems to mean a thing at all

Did you ever see a down and outer waking up alone
Without a blanket on to keep him from the dew
When the water from the weeds has soaked the paper
He's been putting in his shoes to keep the ground from coming through

And his future feels as empty as the pocket in his pants

In old Mexico I stand on the square in Matamoros
Round a Plazza the couples were walking to music so sweet
I've found my love not too long ago in Matamoros
But I'm feeling low as the beggar who sits in the street
All the promises that she made me with eyes black as midnight
How could I know how fickle her promise would be
Now I'm back to find for I feel is mine in Matamoros
And there'll be bad trouble if I catch her cheating on me

Streets're narrow and dark and tequilla runs free in Matamoros
I stopped for one moment outside at Maguel's swinging doors
My heart breaks to hear the same haunting sounds of Granada
She once called it our song and vowed should be mine evermore
Then across the square went this wild young bracero I see her
Laughing and dancing and tossing her raven black hair
They'd may take a hand when I face this man from Matamoros
For the love of my woman is one thing that I'll never share

Now I walk in the night far away from the lights of Matamoros
And recall the last moments when I knew she loved me more than life
I can still hear her cry I love you and I'll prove it Manana
Then seeing my danger she jumped in front of his knife
I know the stories they'll tell in dimly casinos
Of the raven haired beauty who for her love laid dead on the floor
They'll speak of the fight with the gringo that night in Matamoros
And wonder what happened for he never returned anymore oh oh hoo

And make her think of me with every word

And tell her I cant stand to be apart
Yes tell her I cant stand to be apart

Billy Walker,Smoky Places,1969-05-19,1969-07-21,"

Meeting in smoky places hiding in shadowy corners
Dancing where no one knows our faces
Sharing love stolen in the night in smoky places

Oh how I cried on your wedding day
Oh yes I thought that my heart would break
Now you regret your wedding day
You're paying now for your mistakes

Were meeting in smoky places hiding in shadowy corners
We're dancing where no one knows our faces
Sharing love stolen in the night in smoky places

We're dancing where no one knows our faces
Sharing love stolen in the night in smoky places

Billy Walker,Sundown Mary,1968-03-11,1968-05-27,"

I first met Sundown Mary  a year ago today
Traveling the same road I was  going the other way
We talked and then she said you might be nice to have around
If you don't mind a laying your head wherever the sun goes down

I've always been a loner never had no one before
But with every town we passed through I loved her a little more
And one night when I kissed her I thought she felt the same
But then the spell was broken by the whistle of a train

What have you heard from Sundown Mary what has she done today
Is she eating her food from the silver spoon and off of the golden plate
Is she in the chips in Texas or stranded broke in Maine
Do you know if Sundown Mary ever speaks my name
Ever speaks my name

We hopped a train to Baton Rouge the trip took several days
I had no idea that she thought of going separate ways
There in the crowded station she softly spoke my name
And said it's time to leave you cause I come and go like rain

There's not much left of what you'd call the man I used to be
For in her place an empty space haunts my memory
Always broke and lonely I age a year a day
And when I get to drinking nights there's just one thing I say

What have you heard from Sundown Mary what has she done today
Is she eating her food from the silver spoon and off of the golden plate
Is she in the chips in Texas or stranded broke in Maine
Do you know if Sundown Mary ever speaks my name
Ever speaks my name

Heart oh heart I know it's ended

I see you made the morning paper
The story was on the social page
I read the notice of your wedding
And I saw his picture in my place

I turned the pages of the paper
Trying to hide my foolish pride
I read the funnies with a heartache
The funnies were so funny that I cried

Turning the pages I pretended
That you'd still belong to me
Heart oh heart I know it's ended
And I must face reality

I tore your picture from the paper
With every write up I could find
I destroyed the morning paper
Cause it destroyed this heart of mine

Heart oh heart I know it's ended
The morning paper told us all

Yonder comes Willie the weeper
Saddest looking sight in all the town
Had a new love but couldn't keep her
Now Willie's crying heart is broken down

You should have seen the smiling face that Willie wore
The day he found the thrill of her embrace
For the first time in his whole life Willie fell in love
But I took the smile right off of Willie's face took his place

Yonder comes Willie the weeper
Saddest looking sight in all the town
Had a new love but couldn't keep her
Now Willie's crying heart is broken down

I put on the smiling face that Willie wore
And took her round for everyone to see
But she found someone else that she wanted more
Now Willis's smiling face laughs back at me  look and see

I'm just like Willie the weeper
Saddest looking sight in all the town
Had a new love but couldn't keep her
Now mine and Willie's hearts are broken down

Ain't had no bet though my life as yet

Find a little girl that just digs you

My one only (it takes you) when I'm lonely (it takes you)
It takes you

Don't you know you mean more than life to me

Bob Luman,Just Enough To Make Me Stay,1974-03-25,1974-05-13,"

She never says the little things that make me warmer
Unless she wants things to go her way
Cause time and time again I've tried to leave her
And she does just enough to make me stay

She never says the loving words I need to hear
And it hurts because she knows the words to say
When she hears me cleaning out my drawers and closet
She says just enough to make me stay

Sometimes I wonder how I've stayed this long
Like a fool I keep hanging round for more
When she acts like I'm already gone
Until I start to walk out the door then like before

She never gives me the love she knows I'm needing
And she knows I need it more and more each day
And when she sees I can't take it any longer
She gives me just enough to make me stay
Just enough to make me stay

Bob Luman,Let's Think About Living,1960-10-10,1960-12-12,"

In every other song that I've heard lately
Some fellow gets shot
And his baby and his best friend both die with him
As likely as not
In half of the other songs
Some Cat's crying or ready to die
We've lost most of our happy people
And I'm wondering why

Let's think about living
Let's think about loving
Let's think about the whoopin'
And hoppin and boppin'
And the lovie, lovie dovin'
Let's forget about the whinin' and the cryin'
And the shooting and the dying
And the fellow with a switchblade knife
Let's think about living
Let's think about life

We lost old Marty Robbins
Down in old El Paso a little while back
And now Miss Patti Page or one of them
Is a-wearing black
And Cath's Clown has Don and Phil
Where they feel like a-they could die
If we keep on a-losin' our singers like that
I'll be the only one you can buy'

Let's think about living

Bobbie Gentry,Fancy,1969-12-29,1970-02-23,"

Well, I remember it all very well lookin' back
It was the summer that I turned eighteen
We lived in a one-room, run down shack
On the outskirts of New Orleans

We didn't have money for food or rent
To say the least we were hard-pressed
When Momma spent every last penny we had
To buy me a dancin' dress

Well, Momma washed and combed and curled my hair
Then she painted my eyes and lips
Then I stepped into the satin dancin' dress
It was split in the side clean up to my hips

It was red, velvet-trimmed, and it fit me good
And starin' back from the lookin' glass
Was a woman
Where a half grown kid had stood

She said, ""Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down!
Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down
Lord forgive me for what I do
But if you want out girl it's up to you
Now get on out, you better start sleepin' uptown.""

Momma dabbed a little bit of perfume
On my neck and she kissed my cheek
Then I saw the tears welling up
In her troubled eyes when she started to speak

She looked at our pitiful shack and then
She looked at me and took a ragged breath
""Your Pa's runned off, and I'm real sick
And the baby's gonna starve to death.""

She handed me a heart-shaped locket that said
""To thine own self be true""
And I shivered as I watched a roach crawl across
The toe of my high-healed shoe

It sounded like somebody else was talkin'
Askin', ""Momma what do I do?""
She said, ""Just be nice to the gentlemen, Fancy
They'll be nice to you.""

She said, ""Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down!
Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down
Lord, forgive me for what I do
But if you want out, well it's up to you
Now get on out, girl, you better start movin' uptown.""

Well, that was the last time I saw my momma
When I left that rickety shack
'Cause the welfare people came and took the baby
Momma died and I ain't been back

But the wheels of fate had started to turn
And for me there was no other way out
It wasn't very long 'till I knew exactly
What my momma was talkin' 'bout

I knew what I had to do
But I made myself this solemn vow:
That I was gonna to be a lady someday
Though I didn't know when or how

I couldn't see spendin' the rest of my life
With my head hung down in shame
I mighta been born just plain white trash
But Fancy was my name

""Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down!
Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down

Wasn't long after that a benevolent man
Took me in off the streets
One week later I was pourin' his tea
In a five roomed penthouse suite

Since then I've charmed a king, a congressman
And an occasional aristocrat
And I got me a Georgia mansion
And an elegant New York townhouse flat

Now I ain't done bad

Now in this world there's a lot of self-righteous
Hypocrites that would call me bad
They criticize Momma for turning me out
No matter how little we had

And though I haven't had to worry 'bout nothin'
Now for nigh on fifteen years
I can still hear the desperation
In my poor mommas voice ringin' in my ears

""Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down!
Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down
Lord forgive me for what I do
But if you want out well it's up to you
Now get on out, you better move uptown
And I guess she did""

Bobbie Gentry,Ode To Billie Joe,1967-09-04,1967-10-23,"

It was the third of June, another sleepy, dusty Delta day
I was out choppin' cotton, and my brother was balin' hay
And at dinner time we stopped and walked back to the house to eat
And mama hollered out the back door, ""y'all, remember to wipe your feet!""
And then she said, ""I got some news this mornin' from Choctaw Ridge
Today, Billy Joe MacAllister jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge""

And papa said to mama, as he passed around the blackeyed peas
""Well, Billie Joe never had a lick of sense; pass the biscuits, please
There's five more acres in the lower forty I've got to plow""
And mama said it was shame about Billie Joe, anyhow
Seems like nothin' ever comes to no good up on Choctaw Ridge
And now Billy Joe MacAllister's jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge

And brother said he recollected when he, and Tom, and Billie Joe
Put a frog down my back at the Carroll County picture show
And wasn't I talking to him after church last Sunday night?
""I'll have another piece-a apple pie; you know, it don't seem right
I saw him at the sawmill yesterday on Choctaw Ridge
And now you tell me Billie Joe's jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge""

And mama said to me, ""Child, what's happened to your appetite?
I've been cookin' all morning, and you haven't touched a single bite
That nice young preacher, Brother Taylor, dropped by today
Said he'd be pleased to have dinner on Sunday, oh, by the way
He said he saw a girl that looked a lot like you up on Choctaw Ridge
And she and Billie Joe was throwing somethin' off the Tallahatchie Bridge""

A year has come and gone since we heard the news 'bout Billie Joe
And brother married Becky Thompson; they bought a store in Tupelo
There was a virus going 'round; papa caught it, and he died last spring
And now mama doesn't seem to want to do much of anything
And me - I spend a lot of time pickin' flowers up on Choctaw Ridge
And drop them into the muddy water off the Tallahatchie Bridge

My hands are all dirty from working on my little boys bike
The preacher came by and I talked for a minute with him

And I know why shes there Ive been there before
But I made a promise that I wouldnt cheat anymore
I try to ignore it but I know shes in there my friend
My minds on a number and Margie is at the Lincoln Park Inn

Next Sunday its my turn to speak to the young peoples' class
And they expect answers to all the questions they ask
What would they say if I spoke on a modern day sin?
And all of the Margies and all of the Lincoln Park Inns

The bike is all fixed and my little boys in bed asleep

But it sure looks different now
Well I guess I look different too cause time changes everything
I wonder what they'll say when they see their boy looking this way

Oh I wonder what they'll say when I get home
Can't remember when I ate it's just thumb and walk and wait
And I'm still five hundred miles away from home

I'd rather fight a mountain lion in Miller's Cave
So I said you're gonna pay both you and Davy
Cause I'm gonna see you in your grave
They laughed at me and then I shot 'em
And then I dragged their cheatin' skin and bones into Miller's Cave
I couldn't stand the way she did me cause I guess I showed her I was brave
The most wanted man in the state of Georgia
But they'll never gonna find me cause I'm lost in Miller's Cave

This may be our last good night together we may never pass this way again
Just let me enjoy it till it's over or forever please don't tell me how the story ends
See the way our shadows come together softer than your fingers on my skin
Someday these may be all we remember of each other
Please don't tell me how the story ends
Never's just the echo of forever lonesome as the love that might have been
Let me go on loving and believing till it's over please don't tell me how the story ends
Please don't tell me how the story ends

Ride me down easy, Lord, ride me on down
Leave word in the dust where I lay
Say I'm easy come, easy go
And easy to love when I stay

This old highway she's hotter than nine kinds of hell
The rides they is scarce as the rain
When you're down to your last, shuck with nothing to sell
And too far away from the train

Been a good month of Sunday's and a guitar ago
I had a tall drink of yesterday's wine
Left a long string of friends, some sheets in the wind
And some satisfied women behind

So won't you ride me down easy, Lord, ride me on down
Leave word in the dust where I lay
Say I'm easy come, easy go
And easy to love when I stay

I've put snow on the mountain, raised hell on the hill
Locked horns with the devil himself
Been a rodeo bum, a son of a gun
And a hobo with stars in his crown

So won't you ride me down easy, Lord, ride me on down
Leave word in the dust where I lay
Say I'm easy come, easy go
And easy to love when I stay

Yeah, won't you ride me down easy, Lord, ride me on down
Leave word in the dust where I lay
Say I'm easy come

Shame on me for hurting you what can I say what can I do
Last night I was blind but today I see I did you wrong shame on me

You say you won't be seein' me again you say we're through
I wouldn't want to see the sunrise tomorrow if I knew that to be true
I know that just sayin' sorry doesn't sound out a lot
But the girl you saw me with last night means no more to me
Than the thousand stars to the great clouds that cover the night
The more I look at her the more I realize how much I love you
Shame on me for hurting you...

I'll admit I shouldn't have given into love's wild temptation
With someone I cared nothing for I was blind and I hurt you
Can you ever forgive the fool the fool who really loves you
Last night I was blind but today I see I did you wrong shame on me

Talk me some sense talk me some sense
Put a song of love and laughter on your face
Talk me some sense talk me some sense
Cause the way you're talkin' now is a digrace

I've heard enough o' your talk about the world that is to be
You say it's sick and sinful and then any fool should see
You sing songs of agitation and usin' funny rhymes
The whole new trend and your preachin' friend is a great big waste of time
Talk me some sense talk me some sense...

Just call me a illiterate or any other name
But no matter how you bug me up I'll tell you without shame
Don't know where your world is but it sounds quite a mess
But here on earth we waste our time on things like happiness
Talk me some sense talk me some sense...

Every triangle has three sides it's true
There's the wife's side the husband's and my side too
What's the difference who's to blame everybody suffers the same
Oh the game of triangles is a heart breaking game

I tried to be a good wife and keep a nice home
On my job I had to travel I was always alone
It's because I was so lonely that I asked her for a date
When I found out he was married it was already much too late
Every triangle has three sides it's true
There's the wife's side the husband's and my side too
I hate to break our home up but I just got to be free
But I still love you darling what's to become of me
A woman who steals husbands will end up ruining your life
No woman steals a husband if he's happy with his wife
Every triangle has three sides...

Darling, you give me you

A man sometimes might have
When he thinks there's something better than at home
But a woman's intuition will spoil the competition
She can stop the crop before the seeds are sown

When I need strength
You're there to give it, baby
You're always standing by
When I need warmth
Your arms surround my soul
Till the flames of love are burning high

You know my needs are many
And you're there to pull me through
And when I'm really needing loving
Darling, you give me you

You seem to know the moments
That I feel most all alone
Your light can chase the
Darkness from my mind

With you laying here beside me
How could I want to leave?
What better kind of loving could I find?

When I need strength

How I've lived till now

Now that you're around me

And you'll love me too

In the spring of my life she came to me
She brought sunshine where winter winds had blown
Then I took her for my wife in the spring of my life
And she brought me a joy I'd never known

And the years they went by in the spring of my life
And in summer she blessed me with a child
Love continued to grow in the summer of my life
And in every morning sun I saw her smile

But in the autumn of my years I noticed the tears
And I knew that our life was in the past
Though I tried to pretend, I knew it was the end
For the autumn of my life had come at last

Now what, what do you say to a child of ten?
How do you tell him his daddy's goin' away?
Do I tell him that I reached the autumn of my life
And that he'll understand some winter's day?

Now a rose can't be found on a snow-covered ground
And the sun cannot shine through cloudy skies
But I'm richer, you see, for the years she gave to me
And I'm content in the autumn of my life

See the tree, how big it's grown
But friend it hasn't been too long
It wasn't big
I laughed at her and she got mad
The first day that she planted it, was just a twig

Then the first snow came
And she ran out to brush the snow away
So it wouldn't die
Came runnin' in all excited
Slipped and almost hurt herself
And I laughed till I cried

She was always young at heart
Kinda dumb and kinda smart and I loved her so
And I surprised her with a puppy
Kept me up all Christmas Eve two years ago

And it would sure embarrass her
When I came in from workin' late
Cause I would know
That she'd been sittin' there and cryin'
Over some sad and silly late, late show

And honey, I miss you
And I'm bein' good
And I'd love to be with you
If only I could

She wrecked the car and she was sad
And so afraid that I'd be mad
But what the heck
Though I pretended hard to be
Guess you could say she saw through me
And hugged my neck

I came home unexpectedly
And caught her cryin' needlessly
In the middle of the day
And it was in the early Spring
When flowers bloom and robins sing
She went away

And honey, I miss you
And I'm bein' good
And I'd love to be with you
If only I could

One day while I was not at home
While she was there and all alone
The angels came
Now all I have is memories of Honey
And I wake up nights and call her name

Now my life's an empty stage
Where Honey lived and Honey played
And love grew up
And a small cloud passes overhead
And cries down on the flower bed
That Honey loved

And see the tree how big it's grown
But friend it hasn't been too long
It wasn't big
And I laughed at her and she got mad
The first day that she planted it, was just a twig

Loved before your front door is open

Seeker of fortunes, connoisseur of great wines
Dashing through meadows of yellow and green

Having a ball on a couple 'a bob
Treating the ladies to corn on the cob

Winking and blinking and blowing in my ear
Running away with my mind

Leaving the straight life behind

Do do do do do do do do do

Once in a while in my mind I go bumming
Going to nowhere, with no worry of time
Running along chasing after a train
Humming a song in the sun and the rain

Riding the surf and drinking coconut wine
Having me fun with golden girls in the sand
Chasing the sun through an innocent land

I was lonesome for the love I've left behind
So I stole love happiness my heart could find
From a German girl there on the River Rhine

She thought I was free right from the start
I said love words like an actor plays his part
Till one day I knew I meant then from the heart
I'd found fraulein love there on the River Rhine

In the cold and lonely River Rhine
Lies my little darling my fraulein
When she learned I had a wife
From the bank she took her life
I lost her to the lonely River Rhine

When at last I had to leave her side
It was hard for me to tell her how I'd lied
The morning papers told how she had died
Then was searching for her in the River Rhine

Don't spill the corn flakes
They'll break at lunch break
Home from the office
Why did I stop to
Have a beer with the boys
Now my head's 'bout to pop

It's a Saturday morning confusion
If you think you can sleep, it's illusion
Cause you'll probably get a rude
Intrusion from Harry the dog

Harry the dog is as big as can be
And Harry the dog had puppies last week
We couldn't tell if it's a he
Or a she, now we know

It's a Saturday morning confusion
If I could just get to the bathroom
And get a cold rag and an aspirin
To help how I feel

But here come the twins
And they're screaming at me
What is the deal and turn off the TV
Go ask your mother and quietly
Your daddy is ill

There he is, cousin Jack
You got the leaf rake too
Keep at it till I get it all back

Hanging round my yard
Snooping in my garage
I tolerate him because he's my cousin
He's nice to the kids
And Harry just loves him

And if I could just hide in my attic
'Cause I can hear my wife yelling
Take 'em all to the show

I'll take the whole
Neighborhood to the show
I'll just walk out in back
Where the money tree grows
Grab me a handful
And off to the show we'll go

And if I could just get a transfusion
Or maybe go hide in the bedroom
Till five o'clock

Let it be known that at five the TV
Is gonna be tuned to the game of the week
And that goes for dogs and twins
And the whole family

Cooking steaks on a grill
That I'll never get back

Sis on her date and Mom at the door
Smiles as she surveys the sight
For the first time today
The kingdom is quiet

Lord, let us thank you for Saturdays
And may they remain my friends

Cause I work all week long
To keep strong till they're grown
And next Saturday then
We'll do it again

You followed me to Alabama
Things looked good in Burmingham
We didn't find it there
So we moved on

I know your tired
Of following
My elusive dreams and scheems
For there only fleeting things

My elusive dreams
You had my child in Memphus
I heard of work in Nashville
We didn't find it there

So we moved on
To farm in Nebraska
To a gold mine in Alaska
We didn't find it there

So we moved on
And now we've left Alaska
Because there was no gold mine
But this time

Only two of us move on
Now all we have is each other
And a little memory to cling to
And still you won't let me

Go on alone
I know your tired
Of following
My elusive dreams and scheems

For there only fleeting things
My elusive dreams
For there only fleeting things
My elusive dreams

[Verse 1]
Maybe I didn't treat you
Quite as good as I should have
Maybe I didn't love you
Quite as often as I should have
Little things, I should have said and done
I just never took the time...

[Refrain]
You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind

[Verse 2]
Maybe I didn't hold you
All those lonely lonely times
And I guess I never told you
I'm so happy that your mine
If I made you feel second best
Well I'm sorry I was blind

[Refrain]
You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind

[Bridge]
Tell, tell me, tell me that your sweet love hasn't died
Give to me, give me one more chance
To keep you satisfied, satisfied

Little things I should have said and done
I just never took the time

So he told you that you're the dream
That he's been searching for
And he told you, he's never met
Someone like you before

And I can hear him telling you
Your lips taste just like cherry wine
But did he tell you
That he's known as JOHNNY ONE TIME

Did he tell you that your heart
Would soon become another trinket
On his bracelet of broken heats

Did he tel;l you that the morning sun
Would find you patching up your shattered pride
And searching for the missing parts

Did he tell you that the special love you're saving
Will disappear in flames
Shaped like mine

Did he tell you
That he's Know as
JOHNNY ONE TIME

So he told you
That he'd never lead your heart astray
And he told you that he'd love you
Forever and a day

And I can hear him telling you
That he's a shy and bashful kind
But did he tell you that he's known as
JOHNNY ONE TIME

Oh did he tell you that your heart
Would soon become another trinket
On his bracelet of broken heats

Did he tell you that the morning sun
Would find you patching up your shattered pride
And searching for the missing parts

Did he tell you that the special love you're saving
Will disappear in flames
Shaped like mine

Did he tell you
That he's Know as

Well it's over, and nobody wins
Well it really doesn't matter
Who's right or wrong?
We've been hustling each other for much too long
And it's too late to try to say, what might have been
It's over, and nobody wins
Make believe and forever is just a lie
And it seems a little sadder, each time we try
'Cause it's a shame to make the same mistakes again and again
Oh it's over, and nobody wins

We've gone too far, too long, too far apart
The love it was easy, it's the living that's hard
For there's no need to say to see the way it is
Oh, it's over and nobody wins

Well, I ain't got time to mow the lawn
Or fix the roof where the rain pours in
And your suggestion is out of the question
That I go paint the fence

'Cause the Green Bay Packers are warming up
So could you turn it on to channel two
'Cause I'm a big game hunter
And a sure enough gunner
And I ain't got time for you

Well, there ain't gonna be
No Batman and Robin
Take the place of the NFL
And for all I care
Old Archie Bunker can
Go right straight to

Well, what's that you say
You made me miss the play
No, we're not gonna watch cartoons
'Cause I'm a big game hunter
And a sure enough gunner
And I ain't got time for you

'Cause there's a Rose Bowl
Hula Bowl, Cotton Bowl, Sugar Bowl

Have time to fix the gate

And on your way to get
The hammer and the nails
Could you bring me another brew

Well, you're looking good
And I think I would
Maybe steal a little kiss or two
Yeah, the Big Game Hunter's
Gonna take time out
And take a little time with you

In that house down the block with my family

Back up in the woods among the evergreens
There stood an old cabin made of earth and wood
Where lived a country boy named Johnny B.Goode

But he could play a guitar just like a ringin' a bell
Go, go, go, Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go, go, Johnny go
Go, go, go, go, Johnny go
Go, go, Johnny B Goode

He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack
Sit beside the tree by the railroad track
The engineer would see him sittin' in the shade
Listen to the rhythm that the drivers made
The people comin' by they would stop and say
Oh, my but that little country boy could play
Go, go, go, Johnny go, go
Go, Johnny go, go, go, Johnny go

And when it's night over here, over there it's-a breaking day
I remember all the good times I had walking in the sand
With a beautiful girl that I met made in Japan

The beauty of her face was beyond my wildest dreams
Like cherry blossoms blooming in the mountains in the early spring
As we walked by the river and she softly took hold of my hand
That's when I fell deep in love with a girl made in Japan

In the dark of night we would lay on Tokyo Bay
And the singing of the birds woke us up at the break of day
Her smiling eyes always seemed to try to understand
All the love in my heart for the girl made in Japan

My transistor radio comes from far away
And when it's night over here over there it's-a breaking day
She cried when she said she'd been promised to another man
That's when I left my heart with the girl made in Japan
Yes my heart will always be with the girl made in Japan

Buck Owens,Mental Cruelty,1961-05-15,1961-07-31,"

Mental cruelty, that's what I heard her say
Mental cruelty to the judge that day
I sat there in silence so she could be free
And listened to her lying words mental cruelty

Your Honor, since our marriage
My life's not been the same
Why, I'm missing out on all the fun
And he's the one to blame

There's never any excitement now
The way there used to be
And sharing his way of life
Is mental cruelty, mental cruelty

Divorce has been granted
For many different things
Even when there's not a reason
And when no one can be blamed

With only two little words
Why she's on her merry way
Yes, all the woman has to claim
Is mental cruelty, mental cruelty...

Oh, my heart skips a beat when we walk down the street
I feel a trembling in my knees
And just to know you're mine until the end of time
Makes my heart skip a beat

Well, I did a double take the day I met you
My heart turned a flip as I stood next to you
And I knew right there I never could forget you
For you are my every dream come true

And my heart skips a beat when we walk down the street
I feel a trembling in my knees
And just to know you're mine until the end of time
Makes my heart skip a beat

You came into my life without a warning
And you turned my cloudy skies from gray to blue
You're my sunshine that comes up every morning
Yes you are my every dream come true

And my heart skips a beat when we walk down the street
I feel a trembling in my knees
And just to know you're mine until the end of time
Makes my heart skip a beat

And some backstage ladies

I met her out in Oklahoma
Down where the old Red River flows
I vowed my love to her forever
She was my sweet, sweet Rosie Jones

We walked alone down by the river
Just as the sun was sinking low
And in her eyes I saw big trouble
Like the muddy waters down below

Her lips were soft and sweet as honey
Her hair was bright as yellow as gold
Her cheeks were red as summer roses
She was my sweet, sweet Rosie Jones

And then one day a tall dark stranger
With hair as black as winter coal
Rode into town as night was falling
And there he met my Rosie Jones

I woke next morning just after sunup
To find a note from my Rosie's hand
And it read I'd rather die than ever hurt you
But I'm in love with that tall dark man

So now I walk alone down by the river
Where my sweet Rosie used to stroll
And soon I'm gonna join those deep dark waters
For I can't live without Rosie Jones

Her lips were soft and sweet as honey
Her hair was bright as yellow as gold
Her cheeks were red as summer roses
She was my sweet, sweet Rosie Jones...

You'd be my sweetheart

Will there be sweethearts in heaven
After we've crossed the line
If the angels have sweethearts
Then I want you for mine

To face life alone bear this in mind
I'll be a waitin', if heaven's my fate
To take you by the hand
Just inside the pearly gates.)

Buddy Starcher,History Repeats Itself,1966-04-04,1966-07-11,"

Glory, glory, hallelujah
His truth is marching on
This is a strange but true story
Which proves that history
Does repeat itself
And the events depicted here
Happened just one hundred years apart
Both President Lincoln
And President Kennedy
Were concerned with
The issue of civil rights
Lincoln was elected
In eighteen hundred sixty
Kennedy was elected
In ninteen hundred sixty
One hundred years apart
Both were shot from behind in the head
Their successors both named Johnson
Were Southern Democrats
With seats in the Senate
Andrew Johnson was born
In eighteen hundred and eight
Lyndon Johnson was born
In nineteen hundred and eight
One hundred years apart
John Wilkes Booth
The man that shot Lincoln
Was born in 1839
Lee Harvey Oswald
The man that shot Kennedy
Was born in 1939
One hundred years apart
Booth and Oswald were Southerners
Favoring unpopular ideas
Booth and Oswald were both
Assassinated before going to trial
Both presidents wives
Log on to kill this message
Lost children through death
While in the White House
Both presidents were killed on a Friday
And in the presence of their wives
President Lincoln's secretary
Whose name was Kennedy
Advised him not to go to the theater
President Kennedy's secretary
Whose name was Lincoln
Advised him not to go to Dallas
John Wilkes Booth shot Lincoln
In a theater and ran to a warehouse
Lee Harvey Oswald shot Kennedy
From a warehouse and ran to a theater
The names Lincoln and Kennedy
Each contain seven letters
The names Andrew Johnson
And Lyndon Johnson each
Contain thirteen letters
The names John Wilkes Booth
And Lee Harvey Oswald
Each contain fifteen letters
And friends, it is true
History does repeat itself
His truth is marching on

Burl Ives,A Little Bitty Tear,1962-01-29,1962-05-21,"

A little bitty tear let me down, spoiled my act as a clown
I had it made up not make a frown, but a little bitty tear let me down

You said you were leaving tomorrow
That today was our last day
I said there'd be no sorrow, that I'd laugh when you walked away

A little bitty tear let me down, spoiled my act as a clown
I had it made up not make a frown, but a little bitty tear let me down

I said I'd laugh when you left me
Pull a funny as you went out the door
That I'd have another waiting
And I'd wave goodbye as you go

A little bitty tear let me down, spoiled my act as a clown
I had it made up not make a frown, but a little bitty tear let me down

Everything went like a planned it
And really put on quite a show
In my heart I felt I could stand it
Till you walked with your *grip* through the door
A little bitty tear let me down, spoiled my act as a clown
I had it made up not make a frown, but a little bitty tear let me down

A little bitty tear let me down

I saved up my money to buy my sweetheart some flowers
For Saturday's date and I restlessly counted the hours
Then today in the mail I received this short little note
And I broke down inside at the message that her mother wrote

Mary Ann regrets she's unable to see you again
We're leaving for Europe next week, she'll be busy till then
They know that she loves me but poor boys don't fit in their plan
Good-bye true love, good-bye my sweet Mary Ann

The weeks have gone by, not a word have I heard since then
In the papers I read of the far away places she's been
I can't eat, I can't sleep for over and over again
My mind reads that letter and I cry for my Mary Ann

Mary Ann regrets she's unable to see you again
We're leaving for Europe next week, she'll be busy till then
They know that she loves me but poor boys don't fit in their plan
Good-bye true love, good-bye my sweet Mary Ann

My Mary Ann died, they said she just wasted away
If I could have seen her, I know she'd be living today
For we loved each other and if they'd have left us alone
Today she'd be wearing my ring, not a blanket of stone

Mary Ann regrets she's unable to see you again
We're leaving for Europe next week, she'll be busy till then
They know that she loves me but poor boys don't fit in their plan
Good-bye true love, good-bye my sweet Mary-Ann

(gggggggggggggggg da da da-da-da-da!)
My girl baby sister saw it on her block
Then I come up to join her and we start to rock
The baby hears the beat and man it is a shock
When he goes (ggggggggggggg ggggggg)

A rockin type a boogie is the kind a song
That makes this little baby wanna sing along
And though he maybe gets the tune alittle wrong
He still goes (boogie-on-na-day)

He isn't too young to really feel the beat
He rocks back and forth in his little seat
He claps both his hands and he taps his feet
And he sings (doo-doo-da-da-da-da-da)

He is a hully-gully-bouncin-baby-boy
You know the record player is his favorite toy
And dont forget hes eveybodys pride and joy
When he goes (ooo-ah-ge-he)

(Yo-a-ah-ah)

(Ladaladalada)

I know there isnt anyone to take a bet
But surely hes the youngest teenager yet
And probably the hippest of the diaper set
Cause he goes (go man, I like that!)

He strolls in his stroller with the radio on
He doesn't go to sleep until the musics gone
He imitates the singer in the group
With a low down voice (dug-a-dug-a)

And when its time to tuck him in his little bed
With all that music runnin through his sleepy head
The little fella doesnt say goodnight
Instead, but he says (boog-ooo, boog-ooo, boog-ooo
Aaaaaaaaaaallllllllllll gone!)

C Company Featuring Terry Nelson,Battle Hymn Of Lt. Calley,1971-05-03,1971-05-03,"

Once upon a time there was a little boy who wanted to grow up
And be a soldier and serve his country in whatever way he could
He would parade around the house with a sauce pan on his head
For a helmet, a wooden sword in one hand and the American flag in the other
As he grew up, he put away the things of a child but he never let go of the flag
My name is William Calley, I'm a soldier of this land
I've tried to do my duty and to gain the upper hand

But they've made me out a villain they have stamped me with a brand
As we go marching on
I'm just another soldier from the shores of U.S.A
Forgotten on a battle field then thousand miles away
While life goes on as usual from New York to Santa Fe
As we go marching on
I've seen my buddies ambushed on the left and on the right

And their youthful bodies riddled by the bullets of the night
Where all the rules are broken and the only law is might
As we go marching on
While we're fighting in the jungles they were marching in the street
While we're dying in the rice fields they were helping our defeat
While we're facing V.C. bullets they were sounding a retreat
As we go marching on

With our sweat we took the bunkers, with our tears we took the plain
With our blood we took the mountains and they gave it back again
Still all of us are soldiers, we're too busy to complain
As we go marching on
When I reach my final campground in that land beyond the sun
And the great commander asks me, ""Did you fight or did you run?""
I'll stand both straight and tall stripped of medals, rank and gun
And this is what I'll say

Sir, I followed all my orders and I did the best I could
It's hard to judge the enemy and hard to tell the good
Yet there's not a man among us would not have understood
We took the jungle village exactly like they said
We responded to their rifle fire with everything we had
And when the smoke had cleared away a hundred souls lay dead
Sir, the soldier that's alive is the only once can fight

There's no other way to wage a war when the only one in sight
That you're sure is not a VC is your buddy on your right
When all the wars are over and the battle's finally won
Count me only as a soldier who never left his gun
With the right to serve my country as the only prize I've won
As we go marching on
Glory, glory hallelujah glory, glory hallelujah

Cal Smith,Country Bumpkin,1974-04-01,1974-05-13,"

He walked up to the bar and parked his lanky frame upon a tall bar stool
And with a long soft southern drawl said
I'll just have a glass of anything that's cool;
A barroom girl with hard and knowing eyes slowly looked him up and down
And she thought I wonder how on earth
That country bumpkin found his way to town

She said. ""Hello country bumpkin, how's the frost down on the pumpkin?
I've seen some sights, but man you're somethin'
Where'd you come from country bumpkin?""

It was just a short year later in a bed
Of joy-filled tears, yet death-like pain
Into this wondrous world of many wonders
One more wonder came;
That same woman's face was wrapped up
In a raptured look of love and tenderness
As she marvelled at the soft and warm
And cuddly boy child feeding at her breast

And she said,""Hello country bumpkin
Fresh as frost down on the pumpkin;
I've seen some sights, but babe you're somethin'
Mama loves her country bumpkin""

Forty years of hard work later in a simple, quiet
And peaceful country place
The heavy hand of time had not erased
The raptured wonder from the woman's face;
She was lying on her death-bed knowing fully well
Her race was nearly run
But she softly smiled and looked into
The sad eyes of her husband and her son

And she said,""So long country bumpkin
The frost is gone now from the pumpkin;
I've seen some sights and life's been somethin'
See you later country bumpkin

And I see you're eye balling this pretty young lass
It ain't none of your business but yes she's with me
And we don't need no sermon you self-righteous woman
Just let us be

The Lord knows I'm drinking and running around
And He don't need your loud mouth informing the town
The Lord knows I'm sinning and sinning ain't right
But me and the Good Lord's gonna have us a good talk
Later tonight

Goodbye Mrs. Johnson you self-righteous biddy
I don't need your preaching and I don't need your pity
So go back to whatever you hypocrites do
And when I talk to Heaven be nice and I'll put in

Help you dry your tears when the new wears off of your crystal chandeliers

And its plain to see that the likes of me don't fit with you

And you turned away from the love i offered you

She can't go on living alone

Please daddy don't be mad at mommy
She needs someone for all she's been through

Is it any wonder that his face is red Kaw-Liga that poor ol' wooden head

He always wore his Sunday feathers and held a tomahawk
The maiden wore her beads and braids and hoped someday he'd talk
Kaw-Liga well he stood there as lonely as can be
Cause his heart was an ol' pine knoty tree
Poor ol' Kaw-Liga...

And then one day a wealthy customer bought the Indian maid
He took her oh so far away but ol' Kaw-Liga stayed
Well he stood there and never let it show so she could never answer yes or no
Poor ol' Kaw-Liga...

Charley Pride,Kiss An Angel Good Mornin',1971-10-25,1972-02-21,"

Whenever I chance to meet
Some old friends on the street
They wonder how does a man get to be this way
I've always got a smiling face
Anytime and any place
And everytime they ask me why
I just smile and say

You've got to
Kiss an angel good morning
And let her know you think about her when you're gone
Kiss an angel good morning
And love her like the devil when you get back home

Well people may try to guess
The secret of a happiness
But some of them never learn it's a simple thing

The secret i'm speaking of
Is a woman and a man in love
And the answer is in this song
That i always sing

You've got to
Kiss an angel good morning
And let you know you think about her when you're gone
Kiss an angel good morning
And love her like the devil when you get back home

Kiss an angel good morning
And let you know you think about her when you're gone
Kiss an angel good morning
And love her like the devil when you get back home

Charley Pride,Let The Chips Fall,1968-09-30,1968-12-30,"

I'm finding that I'm spending most of my time
Wondering where she goes the rest of the time
But tonight I will find out for once and for all
Tonight I will follow her and let the chips fall
So let the chips fall let them fall where they may
My moment of truth is fast on its way
Soon I will know for once and for all so I'll just cross my fingers and let the chips fall

The life that I'm living is just half a life the girl that I married is just half a wife
But my life without her would be no life at all
Still I must know the truth so let the chips fall
Let the chips fall let them fall where they may
I'm ashamed of the game but there's no other way
I must hold her hand a man cannot crawl
So put the cards on the table and let the chips fall

Charley Pride,She's Too Good To Be True,1972-10-16,1973-01-15,"

Sometimes late at night I wake up dreaming
I reach and feel for her she's too good to be true
Then I touch the sleeping softness of my angel
And half asleep she turns to whisper I love you
Cause she's just too good to be true but she is
And in my arms she reassures me with a kiss
She's everything I ever looked for in a woman
She's just too good to be true but she is

Each day I go to work is like forever till that evening sun will bring me home again
But then she's a waitin' at the door with her sweet lovin'
And tonight she'll be so good to me again
Cause she's just too good...
She's just too good to be true but she is

One day you came along and spoke so tenderly
You kissed me oh so sweet and gave your love to me
One moment in my life I clung to every thrill
Time was a precious thing the day the world stood still
For one day in my life you brought me happiness
You stopped the lonely world with all your tenderness
I can't get over you I guess I never will
Time was a precious thing the day the world stood still
The day the world stood still and you were only mine
I held you close to me and stopped the hands of time
I can't get over you I guess I never will

Charley Pride,Wonder Could I Live There Anymore,1970-06-15,1970-09-28,"

Have you ever been awaken by the crowing of a rooster
While the night is still heavy on the ground
And the voice of Uncle Ben seems to break the morning silence
Bringing lights to windows all around
Well it's time to rise and shine and start another hard work day
Get the cows in and start the milking chores
It's nice to think about it maybe even visit but I wonder could I live there anymore

Something bout the smell of cornbread cooking on a wood stove
Seems to bring a picture to my mind
Of a little three room house with mama in the kitchen
But she can't stop to talk ain't got the time
She's a fixing dad his supper he's a working over time
Tryin' to pay our bill at the grocery store
It's nice to think about it maybe even visit but I wonder could I live there anymore

As I think about my childhood and of my old hometown
I don't really miss them like before
It's nice to think about it maybe even visit but I wonder could I live there anymore

With the mountains and the sea
Where the arms of the world are opened wide
Where the truth is as plain as the falling rain
And as sure as the time and the tide

You know we're all his children
His next of kin that's the way it's began
No matter where you're going or where you've been
You are part of the family of men

When you walk down the road and the sun is on your side
With the sweet river breeze for your face
Though you don't hear a sound as you look around
Everything sort of fall into place

You know we're all his children
His next of kin that's the way it's began
No matter where you're going or where you've been

She's in some honky-tonk tonight I know
Dancing where the music's loud and lights are low
In a crowded bar she likes to hang around
And as long as there's a honky-tonk, she never settle down

Close all the honky-tonks, lock all the doors
Don't let the one I love go there anymore
Close all the honky-tonks, throw away the key
Then maybe the one I love will come back to me

I wish I had the power to turn back the time
And live again the hours when she was all mine
It hurts to see her running with that crowd downtown
And as long as there's a honky-tonk, she never settle down

Close all the honky-tonks, lock all the doors

But it offers me a place to cry unseen
Facing the wall feeling lonely
I can't face the room with all these shattered dreams
I brought her here to dance and have a good time
And for a while I've thought that she was mine
Then through the door walked someone from her past
The things that I had planned with her I knew would never last
Facing the wall feeling lonely...

These tears I hide inside would surely show
I'll just stand here alone and cry until
I hear their footsteps leave the room and everything is still
Facing the wall feeling lonely...

But I'll be around when they let you down and I'll catch you when you fall
I'll catch you when you fall there's no else but you
Now you're flying high but honey by and by you're gonna cry for love that's true
So when you're up town baby starts giving you the stall
I'll be around when they let you down and I'll catch you when you fall

I've heard it said they've turned your head you're ashamed to us back home
But I'll bet the sound of a southern bound still chills you to the bone

And you never once looked back
At your home across the track

You're the gossip of the town
But my heart can still be found
Where you tossed it on the ground
Pick me up on your way down

Pick me up on your way down
When you're blue and all alone
When there glamor starts to boar you
Come on back where you belong

You maybe their pride and joy
But they'll find another toy
And they'll take away your crown
Pick me up on your way down

They have changed your attitude
Made you honey and so rude
Your new friends can take the blame
Underneath your still the same

When you learn these things are true
I'll be waiting here for you
As you tumble to the ground
Pick me up on your way down

Well you heard the story of the hot rod race that fatal day
When a Ford and a Mercury went out to play
Well this is the inside story, and I'm here to say
I was the kid that was drivin' that Model A

It's got a Lincoln motor and it's really souped up
And that Model A body makes it look like a pup
It's got twelve cylinders, uses them all
With an overdrive that just won't stall

Its got a 4-barrel carb and a dual exhaust
4:11 gears, you can really get lost
It's got safety tubes, and I'm not scared
The brakes are good, and the tires are fair

We left San Pedro late one night
The moon and the stars was shinin' bright
Everything went fine up the Grapevine Hill
We was passing cars like they was standing still

And all of a sudden like a flick of an eye
A Cadillac sedan had passed us by
The remark was made ""There's the car for me""
But by then the taillight were all you could see

Now the fellas ribbed me for bein' behind
So I started to make that Lincoln unwind
I took my foot off the gas and man alive
I shoved it down into overdrive

Well, I wound it up to a 110
Twisted the speedometer cable off the end
I had my foot feed clear to the floor
Said that's all there is, and there ain't no more

Went around a corner and I passed a truck
I whispered a prayer just for luck
Fenders was clickin' the guardrail posts
The guys beside me were white as a ghost

I guess they'd thought I'd lost my sense
The telephone poles looked like a picket fence
They said, ""Slow down! I see spots!
The lines on the road just look like dots""

Smoke was rollin' out in the back
When I started gainin' on that Cadillac
I knew I could catch him, and hoped I could pass
But when I did, I'd be short on gas

Went around a corner with the tires in the side
You could feel the tension, man what a ride
I said, ""Hold on, I've got a license to fly""
And a Cadillac pulled over and let me by

And all of a sudden a rod started knockin'
When down in the dips, and she started to rockin'
I look in my mirror, and a red light was blinkin'
Cops was after my Hot Rod Lincoln

Well they arrested me and put me in jail
And called my pop to throw my bail
He said, ""Son, you're gonna drive me to drinkin'
You don't quit drivin' that Hot Rod Lincoln!""

Then Hank and big Harlan got into a fight
And I heard someone holler as out went the lights
Please don't squeeze my Sharmon...
And if Sharmon needs squeezing then leave back to me

Chet Atkins,Yakety Axe,1965-06-21,1965-10-25,"

Poverty stricken but still I'm a-stickin' to the things I know to be facts
One day it's feathers and the next day chicken while I'm pickin' my yakety axe
Ev'rybody says that I never will get far, keepin' out of work by pickin' this guitar
Livin' on a shoestring, puttin' off things like a shave and a haircut

Money don't matter as long as I scatter a little bit of happiness around
If people keep a grinnin' I figure I'm a winnin' my good old yakety sound
City folks go around turnin' up their noses and countin' their greenbacks and smellin' their roses
But I wouldn't trade my yakety axe, even for a T-bone

I'm confessin' I never took a lesson, all my notes are a matter of guessin'
Hopin' they'll come out in some kinda manner that'll make the yakety sound
So if you're in the mood and your feet start tappin'
And you feel laid back and your hands start clappin'
Then I'll have done what I wanted to from way back
You're diggin' my yakety axe

The Comancheros are takin' this land
The Comancheros are takin' this land

Paul Regret from New Orleans
A fast man with a gun
He didn't want to go he had to run
When he shot down the judge's son
Yes, he shot Judge Scofield's son

With the dark of night he left that town
Never to return again
With a one-way ticket at the end of the line
He was told by a stranger man
The Comancheros are takin' this land

Then the Comancheros came a-ridin' through the night
Stealin' and a-killin' takin' ever'thing in sight
Nothin' left behind but the blood and the sand
The Comancheros are takin' this land
The Comancheros are takin' this land

I'll cover every inch of the ground where I stand
I'd die before I'd run
I'm not afraid of any living man
And here I'll make my stand
With a gun I'll make my stand

He rode into the Comanchero town
Like a wild man on the run
Before he'd leave they'd all be dead
They'd die by his blazin' gun
They died by his blazin' gun

They say don't go on Wolverton Mountain
If you're looking for a wife
Cause Clifton Clowers has a pretty young daughter
He's mighty handy with a gun and a knife

Her tender lips are sweeter than honey
And Wolverton Mountain protects her there
The bears and the birds tell Clifton Clowers
If a stranger should enter there

All of my dreams are on Wolverton Mountain
I want his daughter for my wife
I'll take my chances and climb that mountain
Though Clifton Clowers, he might take my life

Her tender lips are sweeter than honey
And Wolverton Mountain protects her there
The bears and the birds tell Clifton Clowers
If a stranger should wander there

I'm going up on Wolverton Mountain
It's too lonesome down here below
It's just not right to hide his daughter
From the one who loves her so

Her tender lips are sweeter than honey
And Wolverton Mountain protects her there
The bears and the birds tell Clifton Clowers
If a stranger should wander there

I don't care about Clifton Clowers
I'm gonna climb up on his mountain
I'm gonna take the girl I love

I don't care about Clifton Clowers
I'm a gonna climb up on that mountain
And I'll get the one I love

Commander Cody,Hot Rod Lincoln,1972-06-12,1972-06-19,"

My pappy said, ""Son, you're gonna' drive me to drinkin'
If you don't stop drivin' that Hot Rod Lincoln.""

Have you heard this story of the Hot Rod race
When Fords and Lincolns was settin' the pace
That story is true, I'm here to say
I was drivin' that Model A

It's got a Lincoln motor and it's really souped up
That Model A body makes it look like a pup
It's got eight cylinders; uses them all
It's got overdrive, just won't stall

With a 4-barrel carb and a dual exhaust
With 4.11 gears you can really get lost
It's got safety tubes, but I ain't scared
The brakes are good, tires fair

Pulled out of San Pedro late one night
The moon and the stars was shinin' bright
We was drivin' up Grapevine Hill
Passing cars like they was standing still

All of a sudden in a wink of an eye
A Cadillac sedan passed us by
I said, ""Boys, that's a mark for me!""
By then the taillight was all you could see

Now the fellas was ribbin' me for bein' behind
So I thought I'd make the Lincoln unwind
Took my foot off the gas and man alive
I shoved it on down into overdrive

Wound it up to a hundred-and-ten
My speedometer said that I hit top end
My foot was glued like lead to the floor
That's all there is and there ain't no more

Now the boys all thought I'd lost my sense
And telephone poles looked like a picket fence
They said, ""Slow down! I see spots!
The lines on the road just look like dots.""

Took a corner; sideswiped a truck
Crossed my fingers just for luck
My fenders was clickin' the guardrail posts
The guy beside me was white as a ghost

Smoke was comin' from out of the back
When I started to gain on that Cadillac
Knew I could catch him, I thought I could pass
Don't you know by then we'd be low on gas?

We had flames comin' from out of the side
Feel the tension. Man! What a ride!
I said, ""Look out, boys, I've got a license to fly!""
And that Caddy pulled over and let us by

Now all of a sudden she started to knockin'
And down in the dips she started to rockin'
I looked in my mirror; a red light was blinkin'
The cops was after my Hot Rod Lincoln!

They arrested me and they put me in jail
And called my pappy to throw my bail
And he said, ""Son, you're gonna' drive me to drinkin'
If you don't stop drivin' that Hot... Rod... Lincoln!""

The tears I cried for you could fill an ocean
But you don't care how many tears I cry
And though you only lead me on and hurt me
I couldn't bring myself to say goodbye

'Cause everybody's somebody's fool
Everybody's somebody's plaything
And there are no exceptions to the rule
Yes, everybody's somebody's fool

I told myself it's best that I forget you
Though I'm a fool, at least I know the score
Yet darlin', I'd be twice as blue without you
It hurts, but I come running back for more

'Cause everybody's somebody's fool
Everybody's somebody's plaything
And there are no exceptions to the rule
Yes, everybody's somebody's fool

Someday you'll find someone you really care for
And if her love should prove to be untrue
You'll know how much this heart of mine is breakin'
You'll cry for her the way I've cried for you

Don't be troubled 'bout me cause I'm tired
From workin' 'round the house
When day is done
Don't think you failed me cause you can't afford
That dishwasher to make my life more fun
You know, the measure of a man is
Much more than just the money he can make
And every woman knows a lot of joy and tears
Come with the wedding cake

The wedding cake is not all icing
And love and tender whispers in the dark
One slice is concern for all your dreams prayed
They won't come true and break your heart
Another slice is feedin' kids and wipin' noses
Cryin' when the doorbell rings and there are roses
Every woman knows a lot of give and take
Comes with the wedding cake

It's facin' shadows of the future
Prayin' they will fall away as we walk toward them
Searchin' for the sun
And it's long and anxious hours with the wolf at the door
Hugs and kisses when, at last, we see the dawn
So when the hands of time trace tellin' lines upon our face
And lace our hair with strands of gray
We laugh and say for all who will partake
It all comes with the wedding cake

Yes, for all who will partake
It all comes with the wedding cake
Yes, for all who will partake
It all comes with the wedding cake

And all the heartaches that you left to make me blue

I cry each time I think about the times I cried for you
I'm sure that I'll get over you as time goes by

And drown all of my sorrow I pray for that day
But until the day that all my tears are dried
I'll have three ways to ease the pain cry cry cry

And framed it up with happiness
And touched up all my lonely yesterdays

That I'd seen my last drop of rain
From now on they'll be sunshine all the way

Before I held you in my arms

And I can't remember much he said at all

I think he left with them but what if he said am
Did they go to meet the train or leave to catch a plane

So I telephoned his house and asked his Mom
If she'd knew where her little boy had gone
I know she must have told me and I heard her loud and clear
But I can't remember anything but tears

Did she say he took the car or what a fool you are

But it's ended and it's over
Baby's gone

[Chorus]
Baby's gone, she couldn't stand to tell me face to face
And things just ain't the way they used to be around this place
Her perfume lingers where she once lay her head
And I can almost taste the teardrops baby shed
As she searched her mind and tried to find
Just where it all went wrong
Lord it's ended and it's over
Baby's gone

Conway Twitty,"Darling, You Know I Wouldn't Lie",1968-12-30,1969-04-14,"

Here I am late again for the last time
And like I promised, I just told her goodbye
Please, believe me for this time it's really over
And darling, you know I wouldn't lie

Didn't I come and tell you about her
How temptation lured she and I
But now I know it was only fascination
And darling, you know I wouldn't lie

Chorus:
I had to let her down easy
As slow as I could
After all, she's got feelings too
But it took a little longer
Than I thought it would
But this time, she knows we're really through

She wanted to hold me forever
And this lipstick shows her final try
And these tears on my shoulder
Are proof that she failed
And darling, you know I wouldn't lie...

Conway Twitty,Don't Put Your Hurt In My Heart,1967-07-17,1967-09-18,"

Don't put your hurt in my heart
Stop what you're planning before you start
Yes, I loved you once it's true but now I'm over you
Don't put your hurt in my heart

Don't put your burning in my eyes
'Cause the burning only stops when I cry
Once my teardrops fell like rain
Washed away the burning flame

And it washed all your hurt from my heart
Don't put your sorry in my mind
'Cause it's useless and you're only wasting time
I got over you before I can't chance it anymore

Don't put your hurt in my heart
Don't put your hurt in my heart...

Conway Twitty,Fifteen Years Ago,1970-10-12,1971-02-01,"

[Verse 1: Conway Twitty]
I saw a man today who said he'd talked to you
Not so long ago I think a month or two
As my mind raced back in time I prayed
Oh Lord don't let it show
He thinks I forgot you fifteen years ago

[Chorus]
Fifteen years ago and I still feel the same
Why did he have to mention your name
I'm as broken up inside as if it's been a week or so
Takes a mighty strong love to keep a man thinking of a girl
He hasn't seen since fifteen years ago

[Verse 2]
I've got a lovely wife who thinks the world of me
Promised her my love through all eternity
I've tried hard to make her happy
And so far she doesn't know
I can't shake this thing of fifteen years ago

[Chorus]
Fifteen years ago and I still feel the same
Why did he have to mention your name
I'm as broken up inside as if it's been a week or so
Takes a mighty long time to get a real love off your mind
I know, I've tried since fifteen years ago

I saw her and told myself
She was my dream come true
Let my eyes deceive me
From the start

[Verse 2]
They told me I wanted her
More than I wanted you
Guess my eyes were bigger
Than my heart

[Chorus]
Wasn't I the foolish one
Lord above, what have I done
For her love
I tore our world apart
Now she's here but it's no good
I don't care the way I should
Guess my eyes were bigger
Than my heart

[Verse 3]
I allowed these eyes of mine
To lead me into sin
Made me think
That I could love her true

[Verse 4]
Now she stands out in the cold
My heart won't let her in
There was only room
Enough for you

[Chorus]
Wasn't I the foolish one

I tore our world apart
Now she's here but it's no good

Hello Darlin'
Nice to see you
It's been a long time

How's your new love
Are you happy
Hope your doin' fine
Just to know it

What's that Darlin'
How am I doin'
Guess I'm doin' alright
Except I can't sleep
And I cry all night 'til dawn

What I'm trying to say
Is I love you and I miss you
And I'm so sorry
That I did you wrong

Look up Darlin'
Let me kiss you
Just for old time sake
Let me hold you
In my arms one more time

Thank you Darlin'
May God bless you
And may each step you take
Bring you closer
To the things you seem to find

Goodbye Darlin'
Gotta go now
Gotta try to find a way
To lose these memories
Of a love so warm and true

And if you should ever find it
In your heart to forgive me
Come back Darlin'
I'll be waitin' for you...

Conway Twitty,How Much More Can She Stand,1971-03-22,1971-07-05,"

[Verse 1: Conway Twitty]
There's a devil in my body that I just can't satisfy
Other women haunt me even though I love my wife
It's because I really love her I try to save her heart with lies
But I know she knows, I can see it in her eyes

[Verse 2]
I tried to stay at home, love only her, play with the kids and watch TV
But then my mind becomes unsure about the kind of love I need
My reasons for cheating, they're as good as lies can be
How much more can she stand and still stand by me

[Verse 3]
It's so hard for me to call her, I can hardly dial the phone
I did wrong again last night, now, I just want to go back home
She knows that I lied, Lord, she'll cry where I can't see
How much more can she stand and still stand by me

How much more can she stand and still stand by me

I wonder what she'll think about my leaving
Wish I could be there hidden if she cries
'Cause leaving really won't be worth my trouble

When she finds the note about me being gone
I'm almost sure her coldness never changes
But still I'd like to know it if I'm wrong

See her there at the table
Watch her tear at the label
From the bottle that she just drank dry
In her mind there's a burning
It took a long time, but she's learning
And just look at the deardrops she's cried

Everbody knows I love her
But her mind is on another
And just look what he's done to her pride
And if she should change her mind
Give up the music and the wine
I'll be standing by to be the next in line

I know her favourite songs so well
And she's happy, I can tell
Just as long as she can hear the juke box play
So I'll keep playing it loud
I'll spend every dime I have
To keep her happy, in my own kind of way

Everbody knows I love her
But her mind is on another
And just look what he's done to her pride
And if she should change her mind

Lord, she needs someone to hold her when she cries

She packed her few belongings left a note and now she's gone
And I can't stand to think of her out there so all alone
As soon as she's gone far enough to know she's out of sight
She'll pull off the highway and she'll cry

And she needs someone to hold her when she cries
Someone who really understands the way she feels inside
When her heart breaks the tears won't stop, no matter how she tries
And she needs someone to hold her when she cries

I don't blame her for leavin' Lord, she didn't want to go
But she thinks I don't love her or need her anymore
I've driven her into a world as dark and cold as ice
With no one there to hold her when she cries

And she needs someone to hold her when she cries
Someone who really understands the way she feels inside
And if she ever loves again I hope that she will find
Someone who'll always hold her when she cries

So disappointed, I laid back down

Oh, what a dream, Oh what a dream I had last night

Dreamed we were walkin' down the aisle
The organ was playing ""Here Comes the Bride""
You looked up at me, you began to smile
When I looked around everybody began to cry

I opened my eyes, and you weren't there

Love is where you find it
When you find no love at home
And there's nothing cold as ashes
After the fire is gone

The bottle is almost empty;
The clock just now struck ten
Darling, I had to call you
To our favorite place again

We know it's wrong for us to meet
But the fires gone out at home
And there's nothing cold as ashes
After the fire is gone

Love is where you find it
When you find no love at home
And there's nothing cold as ashes
After the fire is gone

Your lips are warm and tender;
Your arms hold me just right
Sweet words of love you remember
That the one at home forgot

Each time we say it's the last time
But we keep hanging on
And there's nothing cold as ashes
After the fire is gone

Love is where you find it
When you find no love at home
And there's nothing cold as ashes
After the fire is gone...

With all that insurance I don't guess she would

Would you sing a song about me and the waitresses you've met
About the broken promises we get
Now listen Betty I'm singing your song about the drivers that have done you wrong
All I wanna do is lay the blame where it belongs listen Betty I'm singing your song

There's a broken heart for every truckstop on the right
There's a lonesome driver for each passing set of lights
Now I can't tell you how to love or tell you how to live all I can do is tell it like it is
There's a million waitresses all up and down the line
I've seen some that were laughin' and I've seen some that were cryin'
I've left some that were happy and I've left some that were blue
If you're a waitress here's a song for you
Now listen Betty...

The highway is a part of hell that never caught on fire
The driver is the kinda man that devil wouldn't hire
That's what you're sayin' Betty but you can't stand the heat
Quit that job and let those drivers be
Now listen Betty...
Now listen Betty...

If you wonder why I always look so bad and even when I smile I still look sad
Well it's just because I've lost the only love I've ever had
Now I'm livin' in tumble down shack on shabby little street on the hill in Lonelyville
If you think I'm livin' pretty well it's true
But there's nothing else that's left for me to do
She packed my clothes showed me the door and then she said we're through
Now I'm livin' in tumble down shack on shabby little street on the hill in Lonelyville
Well Lonelyville is not a happy place but now I'm forced to live here in disgrace
I heard her slammed the door behind me tight and I realized I didn't treat her right
So I'll have to face the sadness and the sorrow every night
In my tumble down shack on shabby little street on the hill in Lonelyville
In my tumble down shack on shabby little street on the hill in Lonelyville

I guess you think you broke my heart but I don't mind that we're apart
As sure as there's another dawn you can bet that I will be a long time gone
For every time you lied to me I told myself that this can't be
I know I was completely wrong you can bet that I will be a long time gone

My mind's been on you day and night but now I finally saw the light
I'm gonna tell you now so long you can bet that I will be a long time gone

I'm sorry that he's all alone but for me I'm glad I'll be a long time gone

When she's mad I play a dangerous game
In the obituary column they've already printed my name

She's five feet three and weights about hundred and eight
She's the kind of gal who don't believe in men a makin' mistakes
She's sweet and mighty nice
But when she's mad she's got a voice that'll cut through ice
Well mad ooh she's mad...

She's got eyes like a cat and she watches every move that I make

Dave Dudley,My Kind Of Love,1967-02-27,1967-05-29,"

To your way of thinking a promise is easy to make
Cause to your kind of promise is nothing but something to break
And the laugh fits your lips honey like a hand fits the glove
And your kind of woman don't understand my kind of love
The heartaches you caused me don't cause you the least bit of shame
And I guess if I let you you'd hurt me all over again
And I can't help but wonder what was I thinking of
To think that your kind of woman could understand my kind of love
I made you my life while you made me into your fool
Yes I found that too late that your love meant heartache
Your kind of woman never could be true
But someday you'll know what a hurt when your heart breaks in two
And when your world falls to the pieces then you'll know what you put me through
And I hope I'm around when you'll learn what I'm speaking of
Cause your kind of woman don't understand my kind of love

Storms won't stop me wind won't do it a little rough ride that fits my style

And I have been humiliated by them dang buses till it's a crime

They're blowin' their horns and flash them lights on just fly on by
But you know if I had me a rig I'd do about a hundred under the great big load
Well I'd wind her up tight and I'd blow me one of them grey dogs plumb off the road
So Lord before my last run to the foot of them mighty golden stairs

I was out on the leave at the time just duckin' the fog nosin' around like a hungry dog
In that crazy place called Washington DC
I saw a crowd of people on the White House lawn all carrying signes about VietNam
So I went over to see what was goin' on
It was a strange looking bunch but then I never could understand some people
Oh a fellow came to me with a list in his hand he said we're gatherin' names to send
The telegram of sympathy then he handed me a pen
I said I reckon this is goin' to kids and wives
My friends over there who're givin' their lives
He said ah ah buddy this is goin' to Ho-Chi-Min
I said Ho-Chi who he said Ho-Chi-Min people's leader North VietNam
Oh I wasn't really sure I was hearin' him right
I though I'd better move before I got in a fight
Cause my ears were hurtin' and my ball started hit my lick
Then I thought of another telegram that I've just read
Tellin' my buddy's wife that her husband was dead
It wasn't too long till I was feelin' downright sick
Another held the sign that said we won't fight
I thought to myself boy ain't that right
To leave a lot of our soldiers die instead
I said it's a shame that every man who ever died up there that far off land
Was dyin' for that you wouldn't have to wake up dead
Course he looked at me like I was kinda crazy just another warmonger
Oh I left that place and I went downtown and hit first bar that I'd found
To cool myself off and pacify my brain
You see I was on orders to VietNam little old place just north to Saigon
Had about an hour to catch myself a plane
So all I mean to say is I don't like dyin' either but man I ain't gonna crawl

There's not a soldier in this foreign land who likes this war
Oh Mama tell them what we're fighting for
Tell them that we're fighting for the old Red White and Blue
Did they forget Pearl Harbor and Korea too
Another flag must never fly above our nation's door
Oh Mama tell them what we're fighting for

From Maine to California there are many noble men
Who know the price of war and pray we'd never fight again
But the world must learn that we will fight we will protect our shore

Is to get a little dirt on your hands

Met a girl with a drink in her hand
She had ruby red lips, coal black hair
And eyes that would tempt any man

Then she came and sat down at my table
And as she placed her soft hands in mine
I found myself wanting to kiss her
For temptation was flowing like wine

And I was almost persuaded
To strip myself of my pride
Almost persuaded
To push my conscience aside

Then we danced and she whispered, ""I need you""
""Take me away from here and be my man""
Then I've looked into her eyes and I saw it
The reflection of my wedding band

And I was almost persuaded
To let strange lips lead me on

And now we've left Alaska because there was no gold mine
But this time only two of us moves on
Now all we have is each other and a little memory to cling to
And still you won't let me go on alone
I know you're tired of following my elusive dreams and schemes
For they're only fleeting things my elusive dreams
For they're only fleeting things my elusive dreams

My whole life's saving's a two dollar bill
That's why I'm here tonight I've got time to kill
And I can tell my story about twenty times
Two dollars in the jukebox one dime at a time

Two dollars in the jukebox a dime at a time
Play the same old song about a love gone wrong till closing time
Two dollars oughta do me if you'll buy the wine
And I'll put in the jukebox one dime at a time
And I'll put in the jukebox one dime at a time

Be glad you've got what you've got when you've got it
Or you're gonna find out what you've got is gone
Make sure you know what you know when you know it
Or before you know it you'll be all alone

Take care what you do when you do if you do it
If you don't you won't have your baby long
Be glad you've got what you've got when you've got it
Or you're gonna find that what you've got is gone

Everybody envies you you lucky so and so
You should thank your lucky stars above
Just what she sees in you I guess I'll never know
It's a wonder you still have her love

Be glad you've got...

You'd better treat her better you'd better start right now
She deserves the best that you can do
She does everything for you the best that she knows how
That's the least she can expect from you

Be glad you've got...
Or you're gonna find that what you've got is gone

Doo da doo doo doo doo da doo doo doo

Who is the girl wearing nothing but a smile
And a towel in the picture on the billboard in the field near the big old highway
Rolling down the highway in my Jimmy hauling freight
From Chicago to St Louis Lord I see her every day
A double clutching weasel like me can hardly ever get a girl to look at him that way
Like the girl wearing nothing but a smile
And a towel in the picture on the billboard in the field near the big old highway

Well what a girl wearing nothing but a smile
And a towel in the picture on the billboard in the field near the big old highway
I bet it wouldn't take her very long to be gone
If someone would pull a dirty trick and take her hot pants away
I slow my Jimmy down to twenty that's how many wrecks I see there every day
Caused by the girl wearing nothing but a smile
And a towel in the picture on the billboard in the field near the big old highway

A doo da doo doo doo doo da doo doo doo

Doggone that girl wearing nothing but a smile
And a towel in the picture on the billboard in the field near the big old highway
Sleepy headed painter said the girl wasn't real better get the (kwee) on my way
On Route 66 from the billboard to Chicago
You'll find tiny pieces of my heart scattered every which a way
Shattered by the girl wearing nothing but a smile
And a towel in the picture on the billboard in the field near the big old highway

Del Reeves,Looking At The World Through A Windshield,1968-08-12,1968-11-11,"

When I was just a little bitty kid I remembered one time Mama said
Daddy sends you all his love from Frisco Bay
I didn't understand till I was grown
Why my Daddy didn't spend a little time at home
Instead of runnin' around the country that way
Now I'm looking at the world through a windshield
And see everything in a little bit different light
I got a sweet little thing I'm wantin' to see in Nashville
And I'm down around Dallas and a'rollin' on fast tonight
Long strips of rubber that you see
Were burned off of this rig by the likes of me
And they'll ride along the highways in this land
I'm gonna sign my name in this diesel smoke
And let the ones that come behind me choke
Now I'm looking at the world through a windshield
Watchin' it a flyin' by me at the right
I got a sweet little thing I'm wantin' to see in Nashville
And I'm down around Dallas and a'rollin' on fast tonight
I've pushed this rig through sleet and rain
And I've driven through the rough terrain
Of the Rockies to the docks of old L.A
On down that old Pacific shore, sing north and headin' for Baltimore
Of somethin' bout two thousand miles away
Now I'm looking at the world through a windshield
Watchin' it a flyin' by me at the right
I got a sweet little thing I'm wantin' to see in Nashville
And I'm down around Dallas and a'rollin' on fast tonight

Bound telephone operators walkin' up and down the street

Oh I'm watchin' the belles of the Southern Bell go by
Swingin' their hips and rollin' their pretty eyes
Fine high heels stickin' make me start to kickin' my heels up to the sky
Watchin' the belles of the Southern Bell go by

They say that them lines gonna be much shorty this year
This sounds like mighty sweet music to my year

Well I'm sitting here a thinking about those Philadelphia Fillies
And some may think I'm talking bout baseball
But I'm talking about the ones that wear them dresses on so pretty
And the way they swing should be against the law

There's a lot of dangerous curves in that beautiful city
Oh but you'll never see no warning signs
And if you want to get right down to the nitty-gritty
You can bat a thousand every time

I met a Yankee in New York and I love an Angel out in LA
But those Philadelphia Fillies tore my mind apart
And this Giant's leaving Frisco today

There's some nice looking twins up in Minnesota
And Atlanta's got a brave girl or two
And I cuddled a cubby in old Chicago

Doo do do do doo a doo do do do doo

On a bareback camel I rode across Egypt
Without water in the blistered sun
And in Spain I stood calmly without even a cape
And for the bull he was too tired to run
Bound and tied a gagged and nailed in a barrel I went over Niagara oh yes
But baby last night when you said you loved I turned into a quivering mess

Cause women do funny things to me women do funny things to me
I'm usually perfectly calm and colective and curious as I can be
But ruby lips swingin' hips bitter minds tender sighs
Pretty curles and flirty girls I see they do funny things to me

Without a guide or a gun I went a huntin'
Killed a tiger with my two bare hands
Without a rope and barefooted I climbed Mount Everest
And didn't even get a blister on my hand
Through the Okefenokee I waded pass the gators
And the snakes and skeeters and flies
But baby last night when we started kissin'
I said Lord I can't stand it I'm gonna die

Cause women do funny things to me...

Without a dog or a sled I walked across the Yukon
It was spring but it was forty below
And when they began to plan for the moon
Guess who volunteered to go
Yes I'm always ready to show my courage and my extreme bravery
But baby last night when you talked marriage you scared the living outta me

Oh women do funny things to me...
Funny things to me doo do do do doo funny things to me

There's no way that I would ever be untrue
There's not one single part of me that don't miss you through and through

Eyes are worthless cause you're not here to see
Lips are so forgotten cause you forgotten me
My arms ached from reaching out to you the way they do
There's not one single part of me that don't miss you through and through
All of me belongs to you
Fingers claw the darkness in my dreams
Searching for the love I lost but can't redeem

This great and mighty nation will sing forever more
Of the pioneers brave engineers and heroes by the score
But the world of transportation has its own breed just as great
It's the men of steel behind the wheels of big rigs hauling freight
Listen to the rumble listen to the roar
Of the big wheels on the highways from the mountains to the shore
Ole Buffalo Bill and Casey Jones would never have the gall
The risk their fate on the interstate on the Big Wheel Cannonball
There's lotta speculation when the big wheels roll at night
Some think their destination is a truckstop on the right
With a little ole cat eye waitress or a hot shot on the make
But some I know would rather go for a hot chuck wagon steak
Listen to the rumble listen to the roar
Hear the jingle of the jukebox see the action on the floor
Those giddiup go-go babies do the monkey and the crawl
When a swinging combination plays the Big Wheel Cannonball
[ dobro ]
I try to keep my schedule the way most drivers do
It's food and drinks and forty winks and then go balling through
But tonight I've got a hung up she's the cutest little doll
I'll see you on the straight away on the Big Wheel Cannonball
On the Big Wheel Cannonball on the Big Wheel Cannonball
Tonight she's ridin' shotgun and I warn you one and all
When a devil from St Luis takes an angel on his haul
Don't look for any halo round the Big Wheel Cannonball
Don't look for any halo round the Big Wheel Cannonball

And a hungry little boy with a runny nose

And he learns how to fight

[Verse 1]
Well a good ways down the railroad track
There was this little old rundown shack
And in it lived a man I'd never seen
Folks said he was a mean and a vicious man
And you better not set foot on his land
I didn't think nobody could be that mean
So I took me out walking down the railroad track
I was a-going to go down to that little old shack
And just find out if all them things I'd heard was true
There was a big black dog laying out in the yard
And it growled at me and I swallowed hard
And I heard somebody say well who are you
Oh and there he stood in the door of that shack
His beard and his hair was long and black
And he was the biggest man I'd ever seen
When he spoke his voice was low and deep
But he just didn't frighten me
Because somehow I just knew he wasn't mean
He said what you doing snooping around my place
And I saw a smile come across his face
So I smiled back and I told him who I was
He said come on in and pull you up a chair
You might as well since you already here
And he said you can call me Joshua

[Chorus 1]
Joshua Joshua
What you are doing living here all alone
Joshua Joshua
Have you got nobody to call your own
No no no no

[Verse 2]
We talked till the sun was clean out of sight
And we still talking when it come daylight
And there was just so much we had to say hey
I'd spent my life in an orphan's home
And just like him I was all alone
So I said yeah when he asked if I'd stay
Oh we grew closer as time went on
And that little old shack it was a happy home
And we just couldn't help but fall in love
That big black dog and that little old shack
Sitting down by the railroad track
It's plenty good enough for me and Joshua

[Chorus 2]
Joshua Joshua
Why you're just what I've been looking for

You are not going to be lonesome anymore
No no

I can see you're disappointed
By the way you look at me
And I'm sorry that I'm not
The woman you thought I'd be

Yes, I've made my mistakes
But listen and understand
My mistakes are no worse than yours
Just because I'm a woman

Don't feel sorry for yourself

You might have brought somebody else
Just let me tell you this
Then we'll both know where we stand

Now a man will take a good girl
And he'll ruin her reputation
But when he wants to marry
Well, that's a different situation

He'll just walk off and leave her
To do the best she can
While he looks for an angel
To wear his wedding band

I was just the victim of
A man that lets me down

From a shack by a mountain stream
To a room in New Orleans
So far from my Blue Ridge Mountain home
The men I meet was not warm and friendly
Like the one in old Virginie
Oh they are not real like my Blue Ridge Mountain boy

[Verse 2]
I was just a little past eighteen
When I came to New Orleans
I'd never been beyond my home state line
There was a boy who loved me dearly
But I broke his heart severely
When I left my Blue Ridge Mountain boy

[Verse 3]
Life was dull in my hometown
Lights were out when the sun went down
And I thought that city life was more my style
But nights get lonely away from home
And it's easy to go wrong
The men are not kind like my Blue Ridge Mountain boy

[Verse 4]
New Orleans held things in store
Things I'd never bargained for
And every night a different man knocks on my door
But late at night when all is still
I can hear a whippoorwill
As I cry for my Blue Ridge Mountain boy

[Verse 5]
Oh but I can never go back home
Since the boy I love is gone
He grew tired of waiting for me to return
They say he married last October
But I never will get over
Oh the sweet love of my Blue Ridge Mountain boy

Sitting on the front porch on a summer afternoon
In a straight back chair on two legs, leaned against the wall
Watch the kids a playing with June bugs on a string
And chase the glowing fireflies when evening shadows fall

In my Tennessee mountain home
Life is as peaceful as a baby's sigh
In my Tennessee mountain home
The crickets sing in the fields nearby

Honeysuckle vine clings to the fence along the lane
Their fragrance makes the summer wind so sweet
And on a distant hilltop, an eagle spreads its wings
An a songbird on a fence post sings a melody

In my Tennessee mountain home
Life is as peaceful as a baby's sigh
In my Tennessee mountain home
Crickets sing in the fields nearby

Walking home from church on a Sunday with the one ya' love
Just laughing, talking, making future plans
And when the folks ain't looking, you might steal a kiss or two
Sitting in the porch swing, holding hands

In my Tennessee mountain home

Instead of having sweet dreams about you

Don Gibson,Touch The Morning,1973-05-28,1973-08-20,"

Take the time to touch the morning
Whoa, you'll wish you had some day
Take the time to touch the morning
Before it slips away

Have you ever seen the sunshine
Peepin' through a window glass
Have you ever noticed Jack Frost
Etched so lightly on your grass

Have you ever tasted apples
With the dew still on the skin
Have you ever loved somebody
You'll never see again

Take the time to touch the morning
Whoa, you'll wish you had some day
Take the time to touch the morning
Before it slips away

Take the time to taste the sunshine
As it hangs there from the tree
Take the time to touch the morning
Touch the warm morn on your knees

I've been called a driftin' dreamer
A boy out of place
But I have touched the morning
Felt the cool upon my face

Take the time to touch the morning
Whoa, wished you had some day
Take the time to touch the morning
Before it slips away

Take the time to taste the sunshine
While it hangs there from the tree
Take the time to touch the morning
Touch the morning on your knees

Take the time to touch the morning
Whoa, you'll wish you had some day
Take the time to touch the morning
Before it slips away

Don Gibson,What About Me,1961-03-13,1961-04-17,"

You're happy now it's plain to see you're not concerned with your old used to be's
You could at least show some sympathy you're happy I see what about me
You pass me by with your head up high
You've known regrets since we said goodbye
You've got no heartaches or misery you're happy I see what about me
What about me what about me
Those sweet words you said were just words to deceive
What about me what about me I'm left with the promises you didn't keep
Someday you may find a love untrue you'll feel the same way I feel about you
You could at least show some sympathy you're happy I see what about me

You could at least show some sympathy you're happy I see what about me
What about me

I walked down this ol' lonely street
And no one seems to wanna speak
Oh Who Cares, who cares for me?

All the world seems cold
The world seems grey
Nothing seems the same since you went away
Who cares, who cares for me

Surely happiness can be found
Surely there's someone for me
Must I go through life with this hopeless love
Why can't I be set free?

All I want is you
All I know is you
But somehow our love just can't be
Who cares, who cares for me

Step by step you taught me easy lovin
Night by night you caught me in your web
My self control was overruled by passion
Now I couldnt see the heartache up ahead
Woman, sensuous woman
You control the world Im living in

Someone true is waiting I should be with her
And she dont know I crave your ecstasy
But many hearts will break if I dont conquer

I've held it all inward
Lord knows I've tried
It's an awful awakenin'
In a country boy's life
To look in the mirror
In total surprise
At the hair on your shoulders
And the age in your eyes

(Chorus)
Amanda light of my life
Fate should have made you a gentle man's wife
Amanda light of my life
Fate should have made you a gentle man's wife

Well the measure of people
Don't understand
The pleasures of life
In a hillbilly band
I got my first guitar
When I was fourteen
Now I'm crowding thirty
And still wearin' jeans

Atta Way To Go

Atta way to go you finally broke it off

Or even wonder why that a way to go

Didn't you believe me when I loved you

All this time I tried to think I've known you
I guess I really only knew your name

Atta way to go you finally broke it off
Atta way to go we can't even talk or cry

There was just no price to big to pay
And even though I know I still live for you
The feeling's that you show won't let me stay

What will I do if I can't have you
If I can't have you

I'll try a little bit harder if you will
And if you think we're worth trying to save

We were happy once
I know we were
Where, where did we go wrong
We were on the same side one time
Weren't we
Why would we
How could we
We could not pretend for so long

But I don't want to prolong this misery if you're leaving
And I don't think I'd beg you to stay
But I'll try a little bit harder if you will
And if you think we're worth trying to save

We can make it work
If we care enough somehow
Somewhere someway
Cause surely what we had is worth
Whatever it takes to keep it

So let's don't let it let's protect it
And not let something precious get away
But I don't want to prolong...
But I'll try a little bit harder if you will

And if you think we're worth trying to save
Oh, don't you think we're worth trying to save

Donna Fargo,Little Girl Gone,1973-10-01,1973-12-24,"

It just took a little while for me
To get my head together
Growing up's the hardest thing I've ever done

Here I am like a stranger in the house I grew up in
And learned right from wrong in if I did
Where the sun never shined enough
On daddies growing older and mothers never died in
But she did

And I remember feeling guilty
'Cause I couldn't wait to leave here
Though I loved 'em every way that I knew how
So I packed up all my yesterdays and headed for tomorrow
And it's almost tomorrow now
And daddy's little girl is home
But where's the little girl gone

She bundled up her dirty jeans and teenie bopper magazine
In search of what her life was all about
With a little rag doll named Charlie Brown
And an ol' suitcase full of hand me downs
And a loneliness she knew so much about

Now the dreams that I trusted
And all the playthings have rusted
But here I am a woman somehow
And all those growing pains of yesterdays
Are gonna get me through tomorrow
Cause it's almost tomorrow now

And daddy's little girl is home
But where's the little girl gone
She bundled up her dirty jeans...

Oh, but I can still remember
When I used to gaze out this window
Wondering who I was and what I would become
And it just took a little while for me to get my head together

Growing up's the hardest thing I've ever done
Oh, but I can still remember...

Can't remember my first memory of you
You were always there
And now I know I never knew you well
But I was just a kid
And you were always there to pick me up everytime I fell

And you always warmed a blanket to wrap around my feet
When you tucked me into bed to say my prayers
And I'll bet I never thanked you among all the other things
That I took for granted cause you were always there

Yes, you were always there
So we never took the time
For you to tell me your dreams
And me to tell you mine

And we never took the time
To talk of love and happiness
And life and death and heartache
And pain and loneliness

Why I don't even know if you were happy
Or if you could have been
Or if you could have one wish what would it be
Or what would you do differently if you could live again
And were you glad that you gave life to me

And I'd give anything to tell you am
I glad that you were born
But you'll never hear the words I've learned to say
Cause before I got to know you died of loneliness
And they tell me I grew up and moved away

Yes, you were always there
So we never took the time
For you to tell me your dreams
And me to tell you mine

There were so many things that could have been
But now we'll never share
Cause kids don't know much
And you were always there
No, kids don't know much
And you were always there

To be alone without a wife and a child

Why, the only thing it cost was giving up our used-to-be's
And my little angel baby by the name of Shelly

Bravely I step back into my room
It's only cheap veneer
And I die inside till summertime or Christmas time is near
When up the stairs comes
All my prayers yelling
Mom, it's me, I'm here
For six weeks every summer and Christmas every other year

Just found a note
My baby wrote she left it by the phone
She knew I'd need some extra strength
To make it through the night alone
It says I'll always love you mama

For six weeks every summer and Christmas every other year

But today I got her letter said she'd be my Cajun bride
Gonna go and wed my Cajun baby and I've by the old bayou
Eat a lots a shrimp and craw fish ride around in my old pirogue
Way down yonder

Before the sun goes down this evening I'll be on my way
To see my Cajun baby and there I'm gonna stay
On a Saturday night we go dancin' and listen to the fiddle-o
Lord I got me a Cajun baby just a livin' and a lovin' by the old bayou
Way down yonder

Eddy Arnold,(Jim) I Wore A Tie Today,1961-05-29,1961-05-29,"

(Jim uh huh, Jim uh huh, Jim)

Jim, I did everything that I could
But your fever just wouldn't die down
So I tied your horse to the wagon bed
And last night I brought you to town

But when I got there you were gone Jim
And there was nothin' nobody could do
I bought you a suit and a tie Jim
And today I wore one too

Jim I wore a tie today
The first one that I ever wore
And you'd have said I looked like a dummy
Out of a dry goods store

Jim they said a lot of things
But I don't know a thing they said
My mind kept wanderin' off down the trail
Back to the times that we've had

(Wind her through sun and the rain)
And for gold on the cuff
We've done everything in the book I guess
And a lot they'd never thought up

Well Jim, you're ridin' on ahead
I guess that's how it has be
But when you reach those streets paved with gold Jim
Stake a claim out for me...

You slipped a little heartache in on me
Yes you slipped a little heartache in on me
I thought everything was fine
Thought your love was really mine
Then you slipped a little heartache in on me


I was so sure that I could make you happy
I thought all of our dreams were comin' true
Then they broke this heart of mine told me to find out
I've been dreamin' different dreams than you

You slipped a little heartache in on me
Yes you slipped a little heartache in on me
I thought everything was fine
Thought your love was really mine
Then you slipped a little heartache in on me

There was never any doubt you really loved me
It was positive thinking all the way

There was only one thing I could say

You slipped a little heartache in on me

Before he takes you from me
When you know I love you true
Darling, ask yourself this question
Does he mean that much to you

Does he mean that much to you
That you'll tear my dreams apart
After all that we've been through
Can you turn me from your heart

Can you watch me walk away
To a life, alone and blue
Oh, my darling, does he
Mean that much to you

Is the day so long without him
That you dream of his embrace
Do you care so much about him
That no one can take his place

I'll step down and set you free, dear
If you say these things are true
That's how much you mean to me, dear
Does he mean that much to you

Does he mean that much to you
That you'll tear my dreams apart
After all that we've been through
Can you turn me from your heart

Can you watch me walk away
To a life, alone and blue

Mean that much to you

(Bob Tubert - Joe Byers)

Here comes heaven all satin and lace
Love in her heart and a smile on her face
She's the world to me
Heaven is all my heart can see

Here comes heaven with soft golden hair
Laughing blue eyes that tell me she cares
She's my night my day
Heaven is just a kiss away

I was so lonely till she took my hand
She lifted in my eyes and she made me understand
Here comes heaven like spring soft and warm
I'd give my life to keep her from harm

She makes my heart sing
Here comes heaven again
Here comes heaven again...

I thank my lucky stars for every day I spent with you
I thank my lucky stars because I found a girl so true
Many times I've seen of the girls I might have had
Watched them while they fall in love and watched it turn out bad
So when I count my blessings honey youre my number one
And when I count my heartaches thanks to you they're number none
So if I see I'm little bit too much in love that's true

I'm trying my best to convince myself
That I'm doing the right thing by you
You'd never have asked to be free of our love
And I've loved you so much and I still do

If you had been cheat or wrong me in someway
I guess it would be easier for me
But that's not my story it's just
That you love another not me

I'm letting you go for I can't bear to see
All your loveliness fade away and die
Our folks will be hurt for little they know
No one knows just you and I

The one that you loved is the one that I thought
I could make you forget and never cry
Your heart is still cold I've got heartaches untold
I'm letting you go, goodbye...

JEALOUS HEARTED ME
Writer A.P. Carter

Takes a rocking chair to rock takes a rubber tire to roll
Takes the man I love to satisfy my soul
Because I'm jealous, jealous hearted me
I said I'm jealous, jealous as I can be
Got a stove in the kitchen and it bakes nice and brown
But I need a poppa to turn the damper down
Because I'm jealous, jealous hearted me
I said I'm jealous, jealous as I can be
You can have my money you can have my home
But for goodness sake women leave my man alone
Because I'm jealous, jealous hearted me
I said I'm jealous, jealous as I can be
Gonna buy me a bulldog to watch him while I sleep
To watch that man of mine on his midnight creep
Because I'm jealous, jealous hearted me
I said I'm jealous, jealous as I can be

Album: The Essential Eddy Arnold
Composer: Don Chapel

You told me that others before you
Were foolish to cause me to cry
And just when I learned to adore you
You kissed one more dream goodbye

And left me lonley again
Just like you found me
Lonely again
No arms around me

Just when I'm sure
That my heart is secure
And my tear drops are dry
With a warm glow inside
And this love of mine
Till the end of the line
That's always the time
That I'm lonely again

You told me you wanted me only
That this time and this love would last
You told me I'd never be lonely
And now you belong to the past

And I'm so lonley again
Just like you found me
Lonely again
No arms around me

Just when I'm sure
That my heart is secure
And my tear drops are dry
With a warm glow inside
And this love of mine
Till the end of the line
That's always the time
That I'm lonely again

Lonely people just like me
Everywhere I go I can see
These lonely people with broken hearts like mine

Lonely people their tears are real
And I know exactly how they feel
These lonely people are people just like me

I hear a lonely bluebird somewhere in a tree
He must know how we feel he sings his sympathy
Life is so lonely for those who walk alone
With a heart that longs for love when love is gone

Lonely people they never smile
For to them it doesn't seem worthwhile
These lonely people are people just like me...

One, one, one grain of sand
One, one, one grain of sand

Just one little grain of sand
Can change your life and ruin your plans
Undermine your house of love
Bring it tumbling down
One, one, one grain of sand

Once upon a mountain top a castle stood
Carved out of rock and stone, iron and wood
Then one day a grain of sand grew into an iron latch
Undermine the mountain side and the castle tumble down
One, one, one grain of sand

A lover spoke an angry word that left the tears
The tears led to a quarrel, love disappeared
That word was like a grain of sand
That undermined the things they've planned
It shook up the house of love
And brought it tumbling down
One, one, one grain of sand

Just one little grain of sand
Can change your life and ruin your plans
Undermine your house of love
Bring it tumbling down
One, one, one grain of sand

One, one, one grain of sand
One, one, one grain of sand...

I haven't been well in the last two days
Not since my baby up and walked away
Packed her things and just said so long
Said I won't be back this time I'm gone
That's when the tears broke out on me
And I came down with the miseries
A fever of blues about hundred and three
And that's when the tears broke out on me
I never was sick up till then
But I've got a feeling this will do me in
Every time I think about the thing she said
I get real sick and I have to go to bed
They say I'll live well I hope
So cause right about now I don't know
I see your face or hear your name from a friend
And it's got all over again

Eddy Arnold,Tennessee Stud,1959-06-22,1959-10-26,"

Well, there never was a horse like Tennessee Stud
Along about 1825 I left Tennessee very much alive
I never would've got through the Arkansas mud
If I hadn't been a ridin' on the Tennessee Stud

I had some trouble with my sweetheart's pa
One of her brothers was a bad outlaw
I send her a letter by my Uncle Fudd
And I rode away on the Tennessee Stud

The Tennesee Stud was long and lean
The color of the sun and his eyes were green
He had the nerve and he had the blood
And there never was a horse like the Tennessee Stud

We drifted on down onto no man's land
We crossed the river called the Rio Grande
I raced my horse with a Spaniard's foal
Till I got me a skin full of silver and gold

Me and a gambler we couldn't agree
We got in a fight over Tennessee
We jerked our guns, he fell with a thud
And I got away on the Tennessee Stud

Well, I got just as lonesome as a man could be
Dreamin' of my girl in Tennessee
The Tennessee Stud's green eyes turned blue
'Cause he was a dreamin' of his sweetheart too

We loped right back across Arkansas
I whoopped her brother and whopped her pa
I found that girl with the golden hair
She was a ridin' on the Tennessee Mare

The Tennesee Stud was long and lean
The color of the sun and his eyes were green
He had the nerve and he had the blood
And there never was a horse like the Tennessee Stud

Stirrup to stirrup and side by side
We crossed the mountains and the valleys wide
We came to Big Muddy and we forded the flood
And the Tennessee Mare and the Tennessee Stud

A pretty little babyy and the cabin floor
A little horse colt playin' round the door
I love the girl with the golden hair
And the Tennessee Stud loves the Tennessee Mare

The Tennesee Stud was long and lean
The color of the sun and his eyes were green
He had the nerve and he had the blood
And there never was a horse like the Tennessee Stud...

Yesterday's mem'ries won't let me go Goin' to the place where we used to park Just like always, it was still and dark But it was a little too much for my poor heart Yesterday's mem'ries tore me apart Today I walked down to that little caf where we used to go And I waited for our favourite booth The one we always sat in, not too long ago But when I sat down, tears began to flow Yesterday's mem'ries won't let me go Anymore, if there's anyone around I start to cry I just say, ""Excuse me, but there's a mem'ry in my eye"" Oh my friends, things were mine, they ought to be That I was happy with new arms wrapped around me But as I lied, I cried, and they could see Yesterday's mem'ries, got hold of me

Today I stumbled from my bed
With thunder crashing in my head
My pillow still wet
From last night tears
And as I think of giving up
A voice inside my coffee-cup
Kept crying out, ringing in my ears

[Chorus]
Don't cry daddy
Daddy, please don't cry
Daddy, you've still got me and little Tommy
Together we'll find a brand new mommy
Daddy, daddy, please laugh again
Daddy ride us on your back again
Oh, daddy, please don't cry

[Verse 2]
Why are children always first
To feel the pain and hurt the worst
It's true, but somehow
It just don't seem right
Cause every time I cry I know
It hurts my little children so
I wonder will it be the same tonight

[Verse 1]
Before you go, walk out on me
Take a look around, tell me what you see
Here I stand like an open book
Is there something here, you might have overlooked

'Cause it would be a shame if you should leave
And find that freedom ain't what you thought it would be

[Verse 2]
The years we had were not all bad
In fact I know the good outweighed the bad
Now you say that you've grown tired
You want to be by yourself awhile

It would be a shame if you should go
And find that freedom was a long time ago

[Verse 3]
I know that you can't stand the chains that bind you
They just keep on drivin' us apart
And you could go where I could never find you
But could you go far enough to get away from your heart

[Verse 4]
So one more time, for ol' times sake
Come and lay your head upon my chest
Please don't throw this moment away
We can forget the bad and take the best

If you don't have nothing left to say
Let me hold you one more time for ol' times sake

And if you don't have nothing left to say

A matter of time before I go home

I have been way from her now for a long time
And I've lived a life I thought that it should be
It's a long, long way from now to maybe sometime
And the waiting round is really killing me

It's a matter of time before I go back there
A matter of time oh Lord, before I go home
It's a long way I know and the goin' ain't easy
She'll see me again it's a matter of time

But the trains don't run too often only sometimes
So I guess I'd better wait another day

And a dozen towns ago
I reached out one night and you were gone
Don't know why you'd run
What you're running to or from
All I know is I want to bring you home

[Verse 2]
So I'm walking in the rain
Thumbing for a ride
On this lonely Kentucky backroad
I've loved you much too long
My love's too strong
To let you go, never knowing what went wrong

[Chorus]
Kentucky rain keeps pouring down
And up ahead's another town
That I'll go walking through
With the rain in my shoes (rain in my shoes)
Searching for you
In the cold Kentucky rain
In the cold Kentucky rain

[Verse 3]
Showed your photograph
To some old gray-bearded men
Sitting on a bench outside a general store
They said ""Yes, she's been here""
But their memory wasn't clear
Was it yesterday, no wait, the day before

[Verse 4]
I finally got a ride
With a preacher man who asked
""Where you bound on such a cold dark afternoon?""
As we drove on thru the rain
As he listened, I explained
And he left me with a prayer that I'd find you

Kentucky rain keeps pouring down
And up ahead's another town
That I'll go walking through

Somewhere out in empty space
Long before the human race
Something stirred
A vast and timeless source began
Intelligence was born and then
There was the world
Powers filled the universe
Matter formed and broke the curse
Of nothingness
Love became an ageless soul
Nature reached her highest goal
And breathed the breath of life
Everlasting life
Well creatures come from out of sight
Daylight came from in the night
And all was good
Life became a Masterplan
Love produced the perfect man
That's understood
The image of the makers word
Worshipped him with all he had
But then one day
From in the depths an evil seed
Grew and manufactured greed
That changed the way of life
Everlasting life
Oh the loving power looked and saw
Inside the heart of man a flaw
Began to grow
Well, the fires of hell began to burn
And so he sent his chosen son
To let us know
That love had surely made us all
And hate would surely make us fall
So from the cross
Well he showed the world that dreadful day
That love could be the only way
Or all is lost of life
Everlasting life
For life is love
And love is life

Elvis Presley,One Night,1958-12-22,1959-01-05,"

[Chorus 1]
One night with you
Is what I'm now praying for
The things that we two could plan
Would make my dreams come true

[Verse]
Just call my name
And I'll be right by your side
I want your sweet helping hand
My love's too strong to hide

[Chorus 2]
Always lived, very quiet life
I have never did no wrong
Now I know that life without you
Has been too lonely too long

[Chorus 1]
One night with you
Is what I'm now praying for
The things that we two could plan
Would make my dreams come true

Has been too lonely too long

Squeeze you tighter than a grizzly bear

Hide in the kitchen, hide in the hall
Ain't going to do you no good at all
Because once I catch you and the kissing starts
A team of wild horses couldn't tear us apart

Well maybe some of you
One of you with me
When no-one else can understand me
When everything I do is wrong
You give me hope and consolation
You give me strength to carry on
And you're always there to lend a hand
In everything I do
That's the wonder
The wonder of you
And when you smile the world is brighter
You touch my hand and I'm a king
Your kiss to me is worth a fortune
Your love for me is everything
I'll guess I'll never know the reason why
You love me like you do
That's the wonder
The wonder of you

You love me like you do

[Verse 1]
Are you lonesome tonight?
Do you miss me tonight?
Are you sorry we drifted apart?
Does your memory stray
To a bright sunny day
When I kissed you and called you sweetheart?

[Verse 2]
Do the chairs in your parlor seem empty and bare?
Do you gaze at your doorstep and picture me there?
Is your heart filled with pain
Shall I come back again?
Tell me dear, are you lonesome tonight?

Spoken:
I wonder if you're lonesome tonight
You know someone said that the world's a stage
And each of us must play a part
Fate had me playing in love with you as my sweetheart
Act one was where we met
I loved you at first glance
You read your line so cleverly and never missed a cue
Then came act two, you seemed to changed, you acted strange
And why I've never know
Honey, you lied when you said you loved me
And I had no cause to doubt you
But I'd rather go on hearing your lies
Than to go on living without you
Now the stage is bare and I'm standing there
With emptiness all around
And if you won't come back to me
Then they can bring the curtain down

[Outro]
Is your heart filled with pain
Shall I come back again?
Tell me dear, are you lonesome tonight?

Your time hasn't come yet, baby

And when you start to bloom

With teddy bears at the foot of your bed
The little boy next door who only makes you sore
Is gonna some day turn your head but right now

You're going to grow over night into a lady
With a devastatingly smile
And then a lucky guy will see you
And want to walks you down the aisle, but meanwhile

Your time hasn't come yet, baby

I've prayed I'd never cheat to heed my heart's command
But dear you know to one I've been untrue
I wonder If you think I'd do the same to you

I take the chance   of causing you to doubt my love
I take the chance   to be with you

I know it's wrong for us to steal a kiss
But when I hold you in my arms I can't resist
I have a home and someone kind and true
I know I'd lose it all if I were seen with you

I take the chance   to lose my soul my life my pride

Talk back trembling lips
Shaky legs don't just stand there

Don't let her know that she's getting through with you
Talk back trembling lips
Burning eyes don't start crying
Heart don't let her know that you're breaking in two

Everyday our love's a battle royal
Dear, it seems that fighting's all we do
But if I let you know how much I love you
You'll do things to me you shouldn't do so

Talk back trembling lips
Shaky legs don't just stand there

Every time you up and hurt my feelings
I pretend it couldn't matter less
I'm just hiding all of my emotions
Behind my broken heart I guess so

Talk back trembling lips
Shaky legs don't just stand there
Heart don't let her know that you're breaking in two

No regrets no hard feelings it's over
All the good times together are through
I'll have a lifetime of memories to keep me going
I wouldn't take back one moment spent with you

I can't say that your leaving won't hurt me

And suddenly a smile will cross my face
If she asks me what's so funny then I'll tell her
Another story another time another place

But time moved on and we grew far apart
It's not the way I wanted but the judge has set you free

I just don't understand it how people such as we
Could know the love that we have known but somehow disagree
I hope that you'll be happy the same dear you from me
Now we go our seperate ways Mr and Mrs Used To Be

At first it was like heaven on earth for you and me
But heaven's sure has changed a lot since then
I can't put all the blame on you for some belongs to me
But started out at heaven reached an end
I guess we could have made it but pride stood in our way
For love to live it must have worked we never seemed the same
And so I say goodbye now kiss the kids for me

Yes it's hard to sit here by myself each night
Not knowing where you are or when I'll hold you tight
Yes I have temptations sometimes it's pretty rough
But temptation's never strong as our sweet love
Cause our hearts are holding hands across the miles
Even though we're lonely we can smile
Cause I know you're my woman and I know you're my man
We're far apart but our hearts are holding hands

Today a stranger looked my way and flashed his gold
And said he'd buy me all the treasures I could hold
But I took out your last letter where you wrote you love me so
And there I found the strenght to tell him no
Cause our hearts are holding hands...
And come what may our hearts are holding hands

I slipped out of the house about sundown
While mama was a washin' her hair
And you can bet your bottom dollar she'll come lookin' for me
When she finds that I'm not there

And if she catches her sweet thang runnin' around
I know there'll be the devil to pay
She'll come blowin' like a cyclone right through that door
And I can hear exactly what she'll say

Well, has anybody here seen sweet thang
I got a notion he'll be headed this a way
'Cause when my sweet thang is out tomcattin' around
He finds a sandbox like this to play

I wanna tell all you barroom roses
If my sweet thang does happen by
You'd better take my advice and if you'll blink more than twice
You'd better have somethin' in your eye

I gave my baby all my money on payday
Except a little she don't know that I got
'Cause there's a cute little waitress at the corner cafe
And she seems to like me quite a lot

While we were sittin' in the back booth a havin' a talk
She's believin' every word that I said
When the door blew open, Loretta walked in
Yellin' loud enough to wake the dead

Well, has anybody here seen sweet thang
I got a notion he'll be headed this a way
'Cause when my sweet thang is out tomcattin' around
He finds a sandbox like this to play

I wanna tell all you barroom roses

You'd better stop your runnin' around say nothin' stop movin' on
But who's gonna take your garbage out when I've packed my bags and gone
Each day you walk off over me can't you take another out
If you start actin' like married man maybe we could find the way to work things out
You'll find your key won't fit the lock if you keep on a keepin' on
But who's gonna take your garbage out when I've packed my bags and gone
I know you think I'm runnin' round and that's why you're so peaked
That's another lie of that same old stuff but I hope you don't expect me to belive

Face to the wall so you wouldn't have to see anything at all to make you think of me
Did the cheapness of the moment make you feel ashamed and small

You want me to be something that I ain't never been
I hear you talkin' but your words ain't comin' in

I guess I loved you but I found out so soon
'Cause this heart of mine was fallin' so in love with you
Best of him lots of luck I guess this is the end
I hear you talkin' but your words ain't comin' in

I hear you talkin' but your words ain't comin' in
I hear you talkin' but your words ain't comin' in...

Well I didn't come in here to cause you no trouble
And bartender just forget that glass of beer
And I'm sorry old buddy that I pulled her from your arms
But I just came to get my baby out of here
Would you believe she's never been inside of a tonky tonk
And would you believe she can't stand the taste of beer
Well I just don't know what's come over my baby
And I just came to get my baby out of here

Well I know exactly what you're up to
Cause I've been watching what you've been doing from the door
And I told you once to keep your hands off of her
And I ain't gonna tell you anymore
Would you believe she's never been

I haven't come to blame I do even ask you why
This time it's not the same I've come to say goodbye

No begging on my knees like all the times before
Are just the memories I'm leaving at your door
Don't ask me to explain so I won't have to lie
I've gotta go away and I've come to say goodbye

No begging on my knees...
Yes I've just gotta go away and I've come to say goodbye

Faron Young,If I Ever Fall In Love (With A Honky Tonk Girl),1970-05-25,1970-09-07,"

Written by: Tom T. Hall
#4 May '70 Country

I know that cheating river runs by everybody's door
And I might just fall in there anytime
Plus I'm the kind of man that makes decisions on his own
And I'd go with you if I were so inclined

Let me tell you this if I fall in that cheating river
I'm looking for a genuine pearl

You'll be the one yes you'll be the one
If I ever fall in love with a honky-tonk girl

True love never runs but one direction at a time
And right now I'm in love with someone else
But if I should ever lose the love I'm loving at this time
I know I'd never break it up myself

And I won't make any promises so I won't have one to keep
But I've seen some sudden changes in this world
You'll be the one yes you'll be the one
If I ever fall in love with a honky-tonk girl
You'll be the one yes you'll be the one
If I ever fall in love with a honky-tonk girl

Faron Young,It's Four In The Morning,1971-12-06,1972-04-10,"

It's four in the morning and once more the dawning
Just woke up the wanting in me
Wishing I'd never met her knowing if I'd forget her
How much better off she would be
The longer I hold on and the longer this goes on
The harder that it's gonna be
But it's four in the morning and once more the dawning
Just woke up the wanting in me
I've never deserved her God knows when I hurt her
That's the last thing that I want to do
She tries but she can't tell how she feels but I know
Too well what she's going through
If I love her so much I don't know why I can't do
The right thing and just let her be
But it's four in the morning and once more the dawning
Just woke up the wanting in me

Last night I told her this time it's all over making
Ten times I've told her goodbye
Last night we broke up this morning I woke up
And for the tenth time I'm changing my mind
I saw more love in her eyes when I left her
Than most foolish men will ever see
And it's four in the morning and once more the dawning
Just woke up the wanting in me
It's four in the morning and once more the dawning
Just woke up the wanting in me

I come home at the end of the day
And find her waiting and she knows how to help me unwind
When her arms reach for me I know she's anticipating
Just what I had in mind

Just what I had in mind
Just what I always have hoped I would find
All my life I've looked around
Oh but I've finally found
Just what I had in mind

Many times in the night she will ask how much I love her
And I'll say 'til the end of all time
And she smiles 'cause she knows lying there beneath the cover
Is just what I had in mind

All my life I've looked around

So many times I've told I was leavin' and oh so many times how I have tried
But sayin' your leavin's so much easier than leavin' and sayin' goodbye
Every time I'd start to go I wouldn't get ten feet
I'd go runnin' back like a runaway child that's afraid to cross the street
And my mind might tell my lips to say it's over my heart would only say it's a lie
And sayin' your leavin's so much easier than leavin' and sayin' goodbye

Yeah every time I'd start to go...

When day ends and night falls my heart
'Cause a dream a dream of love

And darlin' it's you I'm dreamin' of

If my dreams're daydreams
Then daydreams I have many of
There's no dreams like my dreams

Why did you prove untrue
When you know it's only you
When day breaks my heart aches
My lips taste the kisses we once knew

There's no dream like my dreams

Well this old picture is so faded you can hardly see
And that smiling face there in the middle well you can see it's me
And that pretty girl there on my left was mine to hold so tight
But I lost her to my friend there on the right

And that big house you see there in the background
That big shiny car I bought to drive her around
And just to keep her happy I worked hard both day and night
Now it all belongs to my friend there on the right

The picture showed the truth but I was oh so blind
I was a guy in the middle all the times
I filled my hopes up till they were out of sight
And then she walked away with my friend there on the right

The picture showed the truth...
Yes she walked away with my friend there on the right

Faron Young,Occasional Wife,1970-02-09,1970-05-04,"

If our life is worth living together then why let it go
If our love's worth saving it needs some attention to grow
It needs more than just an occasional piece of your life
A home just can't stand when it has an occasional wife

The name of the game you're playing must be
See how far you can go
But can't you see what it's doing to me
And the world we both used to know

If our life is worth living together then why let it go
If our love's worth saving it needs some attention to grow
It needs more than just an occasional piece of you life

Well, I spent the better part of my life
On a Mississippi riverboat
I used to be known from coast to coast
As the slickest gambler afloat

I've dealt the cards from Minnesota
To the harbor in New Orleans
I made a lotta big money on the riverboat
I loved a lotta pretty riverboat queens

Riverboat, riverboat
I love your whistle's wail
I wish I was back on the riverboart
'Stead of in the Memphis jail

Oh, a big man got on the riverboat
Our last time in St. Paul
He had a lotta money but his luck went bad
And the riverboat won it all

He said I dealt from the bottom of the deck
And he pulled a shiny knife
But before that gambler lunged at me
My .44 took his life

Riverboat, riverboat
I love your whistle's wail
I wish I was back on the riverboart
'Stead of in the Memphis jail

Well, they came on the boat and they took me to jail
When we got to Tennessee
A gamblin' man has very few friends
Guess nobody cared for me

So I might be here for a many long years
But if I ever get out
I'm gonna head straight for that levee
And get me a riverboat headin' south

Riverboat, riverboat
I love your whistle's wail
I wish I was back on the riverboart
'Stead of in the Memphis jail

'Stead of in the Memphis jail...

Faron Young,She Fights That Lovin' Feeling,1973-02-05,1973-04-09,"

She is filled with mixed emotions
From a need that keeps messin' up her mind
And she finghts the gentle pressures
That keep pullin' on her heart strings all the time
She does fine until somebody's touch wakes the sleeping passions inside of her
And she fights that lovin' feeling until I can love the fight right out of her

She was turned into a woman
By a man and her love for him was strong
Then the love she knew was shattered
When she woke up one day and found him gone
But the craving for somebody's love is still ever present in her world
And she fights that lovin' feeling until I can love the fight right out of her

It's so hard for her not to act like a woman
When all her lovin' feelings begin to stir
She prays for the love she remembers
And she fights that lovin' feeling until I can love the fight right out of her
And she fights that lovin' feeling until I can love the fight right out of her

Loving me to you seems such a bother you made it so easy for me to love another
So don't blame her for stealing me you let her
Where your love stopped she went a little bit farther
You changed so much I was more at ease with a stranger
It wasn't so hard our love was already in danger
She does everything that pleases me you never
And where your love stopped she went a little bit farther
She went a little bit farther to make me feel love
She considered my feelings now she's all that I'm thinking of
So don't blame her for stealing me you let her
And where your love stopped she went a little bit farther

So don't blame her...

Faron Young,Step Aside,1971-04-05,1971-07-12,"

Angry words were spoken
And I left my baby in a cloud of gloom
Got into my car and drove around
Until I spotted this saloon

Came inside and bought a drink
Then I saw you and felt a burning glow
Got the urge to hold you tight
But if I try refuse me, tell me no

Step aside if I try to get near you
Lock your heart if I start making time
Walk away if I say that I need you
Step aside if I step out of line

Bitter is my feelings for my baby
And the things she said so cruel
Half of me says cheat on her
But part of me says stop don't be a fool

Don't let me get close to you
'Cause if I do I won't be very strong
Save me from my conscience
And keep me from being sorry later on

Step aside if I try to get near you
Lock your heart if I start making time
Walk away if I say that I need you
Step aside if I step out of line

Step aside if I step out of line...

Did you ever feel unwanted
Kicked around so much you're taunted
Heart cries out with so much pain
Well that's the way I feel

I loved someone and loved her dearly
Spoke sweet words, she didn't hear me
Left me here heart-sick and lonely
That's The Way I Feel

To cry would do no good

But the more I cried
The more I believed here's what I'll do
I'll let this feeling have it's day
Maybe it will go away
Maybe I will find another

Are there any memories you're keeping in your heart
Could there be an old old flame that might keep us apart

Well there can be no other love that is if you want me

And that's the way it's gotta be

Arms that love one woman that's how it is with me

You tell me that you're so in love but is it all with me

I remember when you said that you were mine alone

Still I can't convince my heart that you're my very own

And if I find you've been untrue you've seen the last of me

Undefeated and I treated baby right
I won every easy round against temptation
And I went right home to baby every night

Then I met an old flame that I used to train with
She gave me knock out kisses to the mouth
When baby learned there'd been a main event in secret
Oh she counted ten and throwed old champion out

But I'll make a comeback comeback this ain't the end
This has been champ will be a champion again
I was punch-drunk to cheat and lose my baby
For the second time they're twice as hard to catch
That's why I'm in training now to ask forgiveness
Getting in condition for my greatest match

I'm defending my claim to the title
I just can't lose I've got too much to win
And when I'm sure all the low blows are over
She'll say champ take off those gloves and come on in

That'll be my comeback comeback she'll kiss me and then
This has been champ will be a champion again
That'll be my comeback comeback she'll kiss me and then

This is the story of the Yellow Bandana
A handsome young soldier and the girl named Rosana

Oh, way down west in the winds on New Mexico
There lived a girl and the soldier who loved her so
And every night neath the full crimson moon above
This brave young soldier would pledge her his love

And he gave Rosana his yellow bandana
To wear in her hair till he's with her once more
He gave Rosana his yellow bandana
Mounted his pony and rode off to war

His orders came and he had to ride west again
Seems that Apaches were causing unrest again
He kissed Rosana goodbye as he rode away
Promising this time he'd come back to stay

And he gave Rosana his yellow bandana
To wear in her hair till he's with her once more
He gave Rosana his yellow bandana
Mounted his pony and rode off to war

That war was over and he came back home and found
That the Apaches had burned the whole village down
And neath the tree where he'd last kissed Rosana
Gripped on the cross was his yellow bandana

And he gave Rosana his yellow bandana
To wear in her hair till he's with her once more
He gave Rosana his yellow bandana
Mounted his pony and rode off to war

He gave Rosana his yellow bandana
To wear in her hair till he's with her once more
He gave Rosana his yellow bandana
Mounted his pony and rode off to war....

Well, I knew she belonged
To someone else at the time
But lonely look in women
Are a weakness of mine

So I bought all she said about the love
He never gave her
And figured I just love her some
And do us both a favor

Just as I got up to leave
He walked through the door
And I guess I thought he'd be surprised
But he looked at me as if to say
He's been there before
And he offered me these words to the wise

He said, you know she's a cheater son
But you believe that you're the one
Who's got a lot of what it takes to change her
And I know now that you can't get her
You ain't much but that don't matter
Nothing suits her better than a stranger

And the stranger man the better
And the chances are she'll set her
Eyes on you the next time she goes slummin'
So you sit back and wait your turn, boy
You got lots of times to learn, boy
Cool it while you can, your time's comin'

Well, it happens that in time
It happened just like he said
And soon enough her shoes
Were settin' under my bed

And I'll confess I did my best
To prove that man had lied
But nothing short of suicide
Could keep her satisfied

So buddy, losing her to you
Was just a matter of time
And it's her time for finding something new
Nothing I can say is gonna
Make you change your mind
So I'll just give the same advice to you

You know she's a cheater son
But you believe that you're the one
Who's got a lot of what it takes to change her
And I know now that you can't get her
You ain't much but that don't matter
Nothing suits her better than a stranger

And the chances are she'll set her
Eyes on you the next time she goes slummin'

And when you kiss me I can hear a thousand bluebirds sing
No matter how that sounds the words could only mean one thing
Your love is heavenly sunshine...
Heavenly sunshine heavenly sunshine...

I am thinking today of that beautiful land
I shall reach when the sun goeth down;
When through wonderful grace by my Savior I stand
Will there be any stars in my crown?

Will there be any stars, any stars in my crown
When at evening the sun goeth down?
When I wake with the blest in the mansions of rest
Will there be any stars in my crown?
In the strength of the Lord let me labor and pray
Let me watch as a winner of souls
That bright stars may be mine in the glorious day
When His praise like the sea billow rolls

Will there be any stars, any stars in my crown
When at evening the sun goeth down?
When I wake with the blest in the mansions of rest
Will there be any stars in my crown?

O what joy it will be when His face I behold
Living gems at his feet to lay down!
It would sweeten my bliss in the city of gold
Should there be any stars in my crown

Will there be any stars, any stars in my crown
When at evening the sun goeth down?
When I wake with the blest in the mansions of rest
Will there be any stars in my crown?

High King of heaven, my victory won
May I reach heaven's joys, O bright heaven's Sun!

Still be my Vision, O Ruler of all

And everytime I've tried and failed I've found new strength in you
For not one time did you lose faith in me

My eyes they scarcely could see
I heard a kind voice ringing so loud and clear
And here's what the voice said to me

Go home, go home and kneel by your bedside and pray
Go home, go home God will answer your prayers today

God sobered my mind and saved my soul
And erased my thoughts from all fears
And back to the Tavern I preached of these words
The words that still rang in my ears

The crowd started leaving with head bowed so low
As the Bartender picked up the key
As he locked the door, he wispered these words
Was the same words that God spoke to me

Polka on a banjo, give it all you've got
Polka on a banjo, watch them fingers go
Of all the songs I guess, the one that I love best

Is the polka on an old banjo

And when they start the band, she takes me by the hand, and I begin to swing her

A song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I live with a memory
Beneath the stars, all alone

Well it was there I found, beside the Alamo
Enchantments strange as the blue up above
For that moonlit pass, that only he would know
Still hears my broken song of love

Moon in all your splendor, known only to my heart
Call back my rose, rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender, like petals falling apart
Speak once again of my love, my own
Broken song, empty words I know
Still live in my heart all alone

For that moonlit pass by the Alamo
And rose, my rose of San Antone
Broken song, empty words I know
Still live in my heart all alone

For that moonlit pass by the Alamo
And rose, my rose of San Antone

When a lonely boy finds a lonely girl that's togetherness

But break them apart and you'll break a heart that's loneliness
So please stay with me and I'll never be unhappy anymore
For togetherness makes loneliness walk right out the door

I just took a trip to heaven I didn't even have to die

How does it grab you baby can't you believe what's goin' on
Did you get that so good feeling it's coming on so strong
Ain't this loving really something I think my heart just touched the sky
I just took a trip to heaven I didn't even have to die

If I'm dreaming please don't wake me love may never come again
Hang on we'll ride together to a sweet or bitter end
Loving you performed a miracle I don't need no wings to fly
I just took a trip to heaven I din't even have to die
If I'm dreaming...
I just took a trip to heaven I didn't even have to die

Freddy Weller,Another Night Of Love,1971-09-27,1971-12-27,"

Lay me down hold me gently whisper words I need to hear
Do the little things I'm fondest of
Let me touch your satin body let me kiss your tender lips
And get ready for another night of love
From nine to five I fight the concrete jungle
Some days I work my fingers to the bone
But I get by because I know you're waiting
With dinner wine and love when I get home
A man needs something warm to come home to
The world outside seems so doggone cold
Thank God you give me something I can hold to
You straighten out my mind and warm my soul
Lay me down hold me gently whisper words I need to hear...
[ trumpet ]
Lay me down hold me gently whisper words I need to hear...
And get ready for another night of love

Down in the boondocks, down in the boondocks
People put me down 'cause that's the side of town I was born in
I love her, she loves me, but don't fit in her society
Lord have mercy on the boy from down in the boondocks
Lord have mercy on the boy from down in the boondocks
Ev'rynight I watch the lights from the house up on the hill
I love a girl who lives up there and I guess I always will
But I don't dare knock on her door 'cause her daddy is my boss man
So I have to try to be content just to see her whenever I can

(Repest chorus)
One fine day I'll find a way to move from this old shack I'll hold my head
Up like a king Andever, never will look back Until that morning I'll work
And slave And I'll save ev'ry dime But tonight she'll have to steal away To
See me one more time. (Repeat chorous)

Freddy Weller,Games People Play,1969-04-28,1969-07-21,"

Games People Play
Oh the games people play now
Every night and every day now
Never meaning what they say now

Never saying what they mean
So they whine away the hours
In their ivory towers
'Til they're covered up with flowers
In the back of a black limousine

[Chorus]
La da da da da la da da dada dee
I'm talking 'bout you and me
And the games people play
Oh they make one another cry

Break their hearts and they say goodbye
Cross their hearts and they hope to die
That the other was to blame
Neither one would ever give in

So they gaze at an eight by ten
Thinkin' bout the ways it might have been
And it's a dirty rotten shame

[Chorus]
People walkin' up to you
Singin' glory hallelujah
And they try to send it you
In the Name of the Lord

Oh they teach you how to meditate
Read your horoscope and teach you faith
And the further more the hell with hate
Come on and get on board

[Chorus]
Look around and tell me what you see
What's a happening to you and me
God grant me the serenity
To just remember who I am

'Cause you're givin' up your sanity
For your pride and your vanity
Turn your back on humanity
Whoa and you don't give a dah dah dah

Indian Lake is a scene you should make with your little one
Keep it in mind if you're lookin' to find a place in the summer sun
Swim in the cove have a snack in the grove or you can rent a canoe
At Indian Lake you'll be able to make it like the Indians do
You take a bus marked Lakewood Drive
And you keep on ridin' till you're out of the city
Where the air is fine with the sweet smellin' pine
And the country side's pretty
And you'll see daffodils peepin' over the hills
Or a honey lovin' mama bear
Just take a left at the bridge go down to Quaker town Ridge
And in a minute you're there
Indian Lake is a scene you should make with your little one...

We'll sing in the sunshine
We'll laugh every day
We'll sing in the sunshine
Then I'll be on my way

I will never love you
The cost of love's too dear
But though I'll never love you
I'll stay with you one year

And we can sing in the sunshine
We'll laugh everyday
We'll sing in the sunshine
Then I'll be on my way

I'll sing to you each morning
I'll kiss you every night
But darlin' don't cling to me
I'll soon be out of sight

But we can sing in the sunshine
We'll laugh everyday
We'll sing in the sunshine
Then I'll be on my way

My daddy he once told me
""Hey, don't you love you any man
Just take what they may give you
And give but what you can.""

And you can sing in the sunshine
You'll laugh everyday
You'll sing in the sunshine
Then be on your way

And when a year has ended
And I have gone away
You'll often speak about me
And this is what you'll say:

We sang in the sunshine
You know we laughed everyday
We sang in the sunshine
Then she went on her way

Your biscuits and love have filled me your beautiful presents sustill me
You're treatin' me just like a king I know what teardrop will bring
That's kind of a comforting thing
But sometimes I wish I was thumbin' my way back to Denver
With nothin' to bother my mind and nothin' ahead but blue sky highway and time

Your shutters you keep closed up tight you iron my shirts about right

The songs and the rhymes that you sing me are nice
But once in a while I wish you'd forget how to smile
And though you really treat me in style

And I'd give the word to just leave it all
And sail on that boat to my China doll

In the early morning rain with a dollar in my hand
With an aching in my heart and my pockets full of sand
I'm a long way from home and I miss my loved ones so
In the early morning rain with no place to go

Out on runway No 9 big 7-0-7 set to go
But I'm standin' on the grass where the cold winds blow
Where the liquor tasted good and the women all were fast
There she goes my friend she's a rolling now at last
Hear the mighty engines roar see the silver bird on high
She's away and westward bound far above the clouds she'll fly
Where the morning rain don't fall and the sun always shine
She'll be flying o'er my home in about three hours time

This old airport's got me down it's no earthly good to me
Cause I'm stuck here on the ground as cold and drunk as I can be
You can't jump a big jet plane like you can an old freight train
So I'd best be on my way in the early morning rain
So I'd best be on my way in the early morning rain

Well back in the country in my hometown I'm the coolest fastest man around
I got a hot rod car and you oughta see it run
I went out ridin' with a friend of mine we started passin' everybody way down the line
And I felt pretty good and boy we was havin' fun
Suddenly I didn't feel so fine cause a highway cop pulled up behind
So I asked my friend if the cop was after me
He just sat there shakin' all over like ol' Elvis Presley and said
Well if you don't know I ain't gonna tell you from now on it's up to you fellow
Words don't count at a time like this

There was a little blonde lived down on the corner
All the boys thought that she was a goner
So I got me a date and we went for a ride one night
We rolled along and I held her hand I felt just like a grown up man
Till she stood over close and hugged me up real tight
I started to stop to get out and run but I didn't wanna miss out on all the fun
So I asked her to teach me to spoon beneath the moon
She just looked up at me and winked them big beautiful blue eyes and said
Well if you don't know I ain't gonna tell you from now on it's up to you fellow
Words don't count at a time like this

Well I finally wised up and I learned all the tricks
And now I'm the coolest cat in the sticks
And I've got more gals than anybody else I know
I drink white lightnin' and I travel mighty far
I like pretty gals and souped up cars
I'm a travelling man and I'm always on the go
There's some bootleg liquor bein' sold in town
And the sheriff's been huntin' all around
But nobody knows who the manufacturer is
You ask me why I drive a hot rod coupe DeLuxe
With three carburetors straight stick ship souped up engine
High compression heads and overdrive hu

Truck Driving Man
Well I stopped at a roadhouse in Texas
At a little place called Hamburger Dan's
I heard that old jukebox start playing
A tune about a truck driving man
The waitress then brought me up some coffee
I thanked her and called her back again
I said that old song sure does hit me
'Cause I'm a truck driving man

(Chorus)
Pour me another cup of coffee
For it is the best in the land
I'll put a nickel in the jukebox
And play the truck driving man
I climbed back aboard my old semi
And then like a flash I was gone
I got them old truck wheels a'rollin
'Cause I'm on my way to San Antone
When I get my call up to glory
They'll take me away from this land
I'll head this old truck up to Heaven
""Cause I'm a truck driving man

I awoke today and found the frost perched on the town
It hovered in a frozen sky, then it gobbled summer down
When the sun turns traitor cold
And all the trees are shivering in a naked row

I get the urge for going but I never seem to go
I get the urge for going
When the meadow grass is turning brown
Summertime is falling down and winter is closing in

I had me a man in summertime
He had summer-colored skin
And not another girl in town
My darling's heart could win

But when the leaves fell on the ground
Boy winds came around
Pushed them face down in the snow

I get the urge for going but I never seem to go
I get the urge for going
When the meadow grass is turning brown
Summertime is falling down and winter is closing in

Now the warriors of winter, they gave a cold triumphant shout
And all that stays is dying and all that lives is camping out
See the geese in chevron flight flapping and racing on before the snow They got the urge for going And they got the wings so they can go

They get the urge for going
When the meadow grass is turning brown
Summertime is falling down and winter is closing in

Walking the floor over you

You left me and you went away you said that you'd be back in just a day
You've broken your promise and you left me here alone
Don't know why you did dear but I do know that you're gone

Now just keep right on walking and it won't hurt your pride
Remember that I loved you and I will the day I die

But there's never an answer, guess I'll never learn

[Verse 1]
I can hardly bear the sight of lipstick
On the cigarettes there in the ashtray
Lying cold the way you left them
At least your lips caressed them while you packed
And a lip print on a half filled cup of coffee
That you poured and didn't drink
But at least you thought you wanted it
And that's so much more than I can say for me

[Chorus]
But what a good year for the roses
Many blooms still linger there
The lawn could stand another mowing
It's funny, I don't even care
When you turned and walked away
And as the door behind you closes
The only thing I know to say
It's been a good year for the roses

[Verse 2]
After three full years of marriage
It's the first time that you haven't made the bed
I guess the reason we're not talking
There's so little left to say, we haven't said
While a million thoughts go running through my mind
I find I haven't spoke a word
And from the bedroom those familiar sounds
Of our one baby's cryin' goes unheard

[Chorus]
But what a good year for the roses
Many blooms still linger there
The lawn could stand another mowing
It's funny, I don't even care
And when you turned to walk away
And as the door behind you closes
The only thing I know to say
It's been a good year for the roses

Imagine a world where no music was playing
Then think of a church where nobody's praying
If you've ever looked up at a sky with no blue
Then you've seen a picture of me without you
Have you walked in a garden where nothing was growing
Or stood by a river where nothing was flowing
If you've seen a red rose unkissed by the dew
Then you've seen a picture of me without you
Can you picture Heaven with no angels singing
Or a quiet Sunday morning with no church bells ringing
If you've watched as the heart of a child's breaks in two
Then you've seen a picture of me without you...

Then they made me the big fool of the year
Oh, they gave to me a little golden statue
Of the torch that I carried for you, dear
They said no one else could even come close to me
And that I was the big fool of the year
I'll put mine up beside
Any foolish love in town
'Cause there's none can hold a light
To this torch I carried round
I can't say I'm to proud of the honor
But then I guess I do deserve it, dear
For to love you after all you've made me suffer
Surely makes me the big fool of the year
Yes, you've made me the big fool of the year...

Oh the ways of the world, and the wants of a woman

She outshined all others that I'd known by far
I had a friend, a big fella, named big Harlan Taylor

Oh the ways of the world, and the wants of a woman
If I figured them all out 'twould take many years

She lost her desire to become my young wife
Chorus:
Oh the ways of the world, and the wants of a woman
If I figured them all out 'twould take many years

Then I started wondrin' what good would it do
If a rubber-tired, new shiny car's her ambition
Then she can just have it and big Harlan, too

(They all say I can't get there from here.)
I'm looking for the town where sadness can't be found
Where happiness is blooming all year 'round
A place where there's no heartaches and no one crys a tear
But they all say I can't get there from here
Surely there's a place to rest a tortured mind
Oh, what I'd give if I could find
A place where there's no mem'ry of all those wasted years
But they all say I can't get there from here

I've been told my days are numbered
Soon mother earth will claim me for her own
But I won't go, we just started
And I just can't leave you here all alone
So my life must go on living
My heart must keep on beating true somehow
I'll let go when you leave me
Then I'll follow you on up to our cloud
My arms will hold you all your lifetime
My love for you will always keep them stong
I'll let go when it's your time
And you'll never be alone very long
Then my life can stop it's living
My heart can stop it's beating and rest now
And I'll let go 'cause you'll be with me
And I'll follow you on up to our cloud
Yes, I'll follow you on up to our cloud...

Collector's Edition
Loving You Could Never Be Better
Well, here we are again
Tonight alone just us two
Where the lights are dim
And true love is coming through
There's no one else in this whole world
As far as we're concerned
We built ourselves a fire so, let it burn
When you look at me
Like you do right now I go to pieces
Because I know what's on your mind it's just me
You've got that love me look in your eyes
Like you've had so many time and how
Loving you could never be better than it is right now
Tomorrow night we'll meet again
To once more fan the flame
'Cause loving you the way I do stays the same
This love of ours is just as strong
As any vow could be
And love could never be better for you and me
When you look at me
Like you do right now I go to pieces
Because I know what's on your mind it's just me
You've got that love me look in your eyes
Like you've had so many time and how
Loving you could never be better than it is right now

It's money in my pocket but heartaches in my heart
And how many times have you heard it said
A fool and his money will part
I thought money it was everything and was all I'd ever need
Oh, but a man without a womans love is like a garden without seed

George Jones,Nothing Ever Hurt Me (Half As Bad As Losing You),1973-06-25,1973-09-10,"

[Verse 1]
Well, I've had a splitting headache from my eyebrows to my backbone
Arthritis, appendicitis, Bright's Disease, and gall stones
Bleeding ulcers, ingrown toe nails, swollen adenoids
The Asian Flu a time or two, and inflamed vocal chords
I've had a toothache so severe my jawbone split in two
But nothing's ever hurt me half as bad as losing you

[Verse 2]
Well, I've had the lit end of a cigar pressed against my belly
Whupped on with a crowbar till my eyeball turned to jelly
Accidentally nailed my index finger to the wall
Cut off half my toes and soaked my foot in alcohol
I've had my pelvis ruptured by an angry kangaroo
But nothing's ever hurt me half as bad as losing you

[Bridge]
Well, it's not because you measure fifty, twenty, forty-four
It's surely not because you own a chain of liquor stores
It's not because your daddy is the richest man in town
It's just that I've grown used to you and having you around

[Verse 3]
I've had my parents tell me, ""Son, we don't love you at all""
I've seen my sister's name written on a washroom wall
My best friend set my barn on fire burned my horse to death
I went out with a girl who told me, ""George, you've got bad breath""
Last week I drew a crowd when I went to the city zoo
But nothing's ever hurt me half as bad as losing you

[Verse 1]
Well, I've had a splitting headache from my eyebrows to my backbone

Where I learned about salvation
From the book of Revelation
And in arbors by the side of the road

Old brush arbors by the side of the road
Where a sinner could lay down his heavy load
It was in those old brush arbors
Troubled souls found peaceful habor

From the way of life I started
In them arbors by the side of the road
But each time the devil caught me

Where the mighty light of God's great mercy flowed
There was praying, shouting, singing
Till the country side was ringing
Brush arbors by the side of the road...

I'm so glad to have you back within these arms of mine
I can finally close these eyes and get some rest
Never once did I think of finding someone new
Cause there's nothing better, once you've had the best
You're the very thing they sing about in love songs
And one mistake don't mean you've failed the test
And as you lay beside me softly sleeping this I know
There's nothing better, once you have the best
Within your arms, I've had the best
And I think the world should know
I don't care what you've said or done
I'll always love you so
You've got more love in your little finger than all the rest
And there's nothing better, once you've had the best
No, there's nothing better, once you've had the best...

From Morenci, Arizona where the copper mines glow
I could see Clifton in the canyon below
In Clifton lived Rosey, we danced and we dined
On the money I made in the open pit mine
I loved my sweet Rosey and she loved me too
There was nothin' for Rosey that I wouldn't do
Her hugs and her kisses they were something devine
Gave me reason for working the open pit mine
--- Instrumental ---
While I was out walkin' with my Rosey one day
We passed a store window with rings on display
I bought those she wanted, how they really did shine
With the money I scraped from that open pit mine
Her love would bring heartbreak that I would soon learn
'Cause she would two time me when my back was turned
Rosey would go dancin' and drink the red wine
While I worked like a slave in that open pit mine
--- Instrumental ---
One night I caught Rosey on her rendevous
She was huggin' and kissin' with somebody new
It was there that I shot 'em while their arms were entwined
Then I buried her deep in that open pit mine
I took a look at my future and what did I see
There was nothin' but trouble a-waiting for me
But on the sun's next rising I'll be satisfied
'Cause they'll find me there sleepin' by my sweet Rosey's side...

(George Jones - Darrell Edwards - Herbie Treece)
What goes wrong with the mind of a man in a bar
Who sits and keep drinking with his thoughts strayed so far
It's the same old sad story that has often been told
One drink then another till he's out of control
As he sits at a table with his hands on the glass
For him there's no future there's only the past
He reaches for the bottle but his hands don't take hold
His eyes just can't focus he's out of control
Does he search for contentment that he might hope to find
From a honky tonk woman or the bottles of wine
He shakes and he trembles even though he's not old
Like a leaf in a whirlwind he's out of control
Yes I'm just like that fellow who sits there all alone
With no one to love me no family at home
I'm a picture of others with a future so cold
A life ain't worth livin' when it's out of control...

The wind blows Sunday papers at my feet
As I walk down this cold and lonely street
My hands searched through my pockets for a dime
While the memory of you eats away my mind
And looking back I see that I was wrong
But the road I'm on don't lead me back to home
And I can't turn back 'cause everything is gone, yes, it's gone
Right won't touch a hand that's filled with wrong
I was filled with so much jealousy
And doubted all the love you had for me
But now I see the kind of fool I've been
And I'll never see the one I love again
Cause, looking back I see that I was wrong
But the road I'm on don't lead me back to home

I won't say that I'm the only one, who loves her
And I won't say I make her happy all the time
There's someone she can't forget
I know she never will, and yet
But as far as my heart's concerned, she's mine

She never once has told me that, she needs me
And she forgets when I'm around her all the time
There are words I try to say
When she turns and walks away
But as far as my heart's concerned, she's mine

She's mine and yet I know someday, I'll lose her
But she'll never take this happiness I've found
And I know it may sound foolish when I tell you
That I'm satisfied just having her around

Even when she's in my arms, I know she's lonely
I wish that I could take that someone from her mind
But since her mother left our world
She's been daddy's little girl
She's a baby, I'm her daddy, and she's mine...

Will soon make a young man wither away

Six long days each week I toil and I sweat
But on Sunday my family gives me comfort and rest
Then again Monday morning I'll make tracks in the sand
For I'm a small time laboring man
I'm a small time laboring man
Fighting against trying as hard as I can
I fight for my country with my caloused hands

Making my honest dollar in the sun, snow and rain
No, you don't see my family on the starvation plan

I'll be somewhere in your future
To help you forget the past
And you'll know that I love you
With a love that's sincere
'Cause I'll wait 'til you're thru living
In your tender years. (tender years.)
Yes, you'll know that I love you

George Jones,The Last Town I Painted,1964-03-23,1964-04-06,"

The last town i painted
(Writer Buddy Word)
  '63 Glad Music 

I came home the other night I've been out on a town
I searched talk through the house she was not around
I finally found her note it red this is goodbye to you
And that's the last town I painted and I painted it blue
Now that I have lost her I don't want to live
I done all the takin' I didn't want to give
Time has come it's plain to see the devil must pay his dues
And that's the last town I painted and I painted it blue
I still go to the tavern that I went to before
I search for the fun I had it's not there anymore
If I could have her back again I know I would be true
Cause the last town I painted I painted it blue
Now blue is not my favorite color cause it makes me sad
Why I asked for all these blues when I'm usin' too much red
I've got a lotta troubles no one to tell it to
Cause the last town I painted I painted it blue

George Jones,The Race Is On,1964-09-21,1965-03-29,"

I feel tears wellin' up cold and deep inside
Like my heart's sprung a big leak
And the stab of loneliness, sharp and painful
That I may never shake
Now you might say that I was taking it hard
Since you wrote me off with a call
But don't you wager that I'll hide the sorrow
When I may break right down and bawl

Now the race is on and here comes pride up the backstretch
Heartaches are going to the inside
My tears are holding back
They're trying not to fall
My heart's out of the running
True love's scratched for another's sake
The race is on and it looks like heartaches
And the winner loses all

One day I had ventured in love, never once suspecting
What the final results would be
How I lived in fear of waking up each morning
And finding that you'd gone from me
There's aching and pain in my heart
For the day was the one that I hated to face
Somebody new came up to win her
And I came out in second place

Now the race is on and here comes pride up the backstretch
Heartaches are going to the inside
My tears are holding back
They're trying not to fall
My heart's out of the running
True love's scratched for another's sake
The race is on and it looks like heartaches
And the winner loses all

George Jones,The Window Up Above,1960-11-07,1961-06-26,"

I've been living a new way
Of life that I love so
But I can see the clouds are gath'ring
And the storm will wreck our home
For last night he held you tightly
And you didn't even shove
This is true for I've been watching (watching you)
From the window up above
You must have thought that I was sleeping
And I wish that I had been
But I guess it's best to know you
And the way your heart can sin
I thought we belonged together
And our hearts fit like a glove
I was wrong for I've been watching (watching you)
From the window up above
--- Instrumental ---
From my eyes the teardrops started
As I listened on and on
I heard you whisper to him softly
That our marriage was all wrong
But I hope he makes you happy
And you will never lose his love
I was wrong, I was watching (watching you)
From the window up above
How I wish I could be dreaming
And wake up to an honest love
I was wrong for I was watching (watching you)
From the window up above...

George Jones,Things Have Gone To Pieces,1965-03-08,1965-07-26,"

Oh, the faucet started drippin' in the kitchen
And last night your picture fell down from the wall
Today the boss said ""Sorry I can't use you anymore.""
And tonight the light bulb went out in the hall

[Chorus]
Things have gone to pieces since you left me
Nothing turns out half-right now it seems
There ain't nothing in my pocket
But three nickels and a dime
But I'm holding to the pieces of my dream

Somebody threw a baseball through my window
And the arm fell off my favorite chair, again
The man called me today and said he'd haul my things away
If I didn't get my payments made by ten

[Chorus]
Things have gone to pieces since you left me
Nothing turns out half-right now it seems
There ain't nothing in my pocket
But three nickels and a dime
But I'm holding to the pieces of my dream...

[Verse 1]
I've got a pocket full of pennies
The heart full of gold
Though my troubles are many
I have treasures untold
And the shack that I live in
Is a palace to me
For the treasure of love
The treasure of love, you gave to me

[Verse 2]
In this world there are riches
That money can't buy
Like the treasure of true love
A love that won't die
So why should I worry
What tomorrow will bring
For the treasure of love
The treasure of love, makes me a king

[Verse 3]
Though my clothes are all tattered
And I've seen better days
Know it really don't matter
For I'm rich in other way
Yes, my pockets are empty
But still wealthy, I'll be
With the treasure of love
The treasure of love, you gave to me

We can make it

The world is rough but we can make it
'Cause you're my shelter from the storm now
I don't need wine to keep me warm now

No temptation can ever shake our loves foundation
We're strong enough to take it
We can make it

Now we'll say goodbye to stormy weather
Safe within each others arms
We can spend our lives together

Love has found us and now it's chain
Is wrapped all around us and no one can break it
We can make it

Love has found us and now it's chain
Is wrapped all around us and no one can break it

[Intro]
What my woman can't do can't be done

[Verse 1]
It amazes me how she can change my mind
When it seems to be impossible, she can do it every time
And the way she always loves me, she's got that down perfect too
I keep asking myself, ""What is it the lady can't do?""

[Verse 2]
She brightens any room she walks inside
And the way she comes in smiling, you'd never think she ever cried
She still looks as young and pretty as the day we met
If there's one thing bad about her, I ain't found it yet

[Chorus]
What it is my woman can't do, can't be done
If there's ever been a darlin', I've got one
She beats all I've ever seen
She's the champion of our team
What my woman can't do can't be done
What my woman can't do can't be done

I'll be your when the grass grows over me
When you left I thought that I would soon get over you
Even told myself that I would find somebody too
Time and tears have come and gone but not your memory
But I'll be over you when the grass grows over me
Chorus:
Yes, I'll be over you when you're standing over me
And as you look down at the cold, cold ground I'm sleeping in
Don't expect to hear me say that I still love you then
'Cause I'll be over you when the grass grows over me
Even when my eyes are closed they keep on seeing you
Every minute I'm alive I'm hurting through and through
And as long as I live I know I won't be free
But I'll be over you when the grass grows over me
Chorus:
Yes, I'll be over you when you're standing over me
And as you look down at the cold, cold ground I'm sleeping in
Don't expect to hear me say that I still love you then

(Marge Barton - Fred McRae)
Where does a little tear come from?
Where does a little tear come from?
It comes from a heart that's been broken apart
That's where a little tear comes from
Where does the broken heart come from?
Where does the broken heart come from?
It comes when you find that you love the roving kind
That's where the broken heart comes from
Where does the roving kind come from?
Where does the roving kind come from?
From the wild and restless river that wanders on forever
That's where the roving kind comes from
Where does the restless river come from?
Where does the restless river come from?
It comes from little tears that I shed through the years
That's where the restless river comes from
Where does a little tear come from?...

George Jones,Where Grass Won't Grow,1970-03-23,1970-05-11,"

The dirt was clay an' was the color of the blood in me
A twelve acre farm on a ridge in south Tennessee
We left our sweat all over that land
Behind a mule we watched grow old
Row after row
Trying to grow corn an' cotton on ground so poor that grass won't grow
There was one old store in the holler we all called town
It belonged to a gentle old man named Henry Brown
He gave us grits and in the winter time
So we could live through the cold
When the winds brought snow
Trying to grow corn an' cotton on ground so poor that grass won't grow
The one I loved walked through those fields with me
A hard workin' woman, true as one could be
But then one year, death was goin' round
And swiftly took it's toll
Janie had to go
Now she lies asleep under ground so poor that grass won't grow
As I stand here looking over this part of Tennessee
The fields are bare as far as the eye can see
And over the ground where Janie lies
There's a beautiful sight to behold
And no one knows
Why there's flowers growin' on ground so poor that grass won't grow...

Well, I asked my old pappy why he called his brew
White lightnin' 'stead of mountain dew

I think I wanna taste that powerful stuff
He took one s-slug and drank it right down
And I heard him a moaning as he hit the ground

Like a string she's got me wrapped around her finger
And it gets a little tighter every day
It would break my heart to think that I would lose her
So I'll do anything I can to make her stay
If she could understand how much I need her
Then I know that she would never go away
For she's got me wrapped around her little finger
And it gets a little tighter every day
Let me tell you just how much I love my baby
Take the world and everything one may desire
For there's only room in my heart for this lady
Who keeps the burning in my heart as hot as fire
She's the one who's always lying here beside me
But her mother's never very far away
Yes, she's got me wrapped around her little finger
And it gets a little tighter every day
She pulls the string a little tighter every day...

I'll tell you about her for you ought to know
You comb her hair every mornin'
And make sure she's dressed just right
You comb her hair every mornin'
And put her to bed everynight
When she's around me sometimes I can hardly speak
I stammer and I walk right into doors
And just to hold her hand in mine makes me feel weak
Oh, you know her heart is a friend of yours
You comb her hair every mornin'
And make sure she's dressed just right
You comb her hair every mornin'
And put her to bed everynight...

We should stay away forever but we're lonesome each night
Yes we stay away for awhile but we know in the end
We'll invite them over again

George Jones & Melba Montgomery,Multiply The Heartaches,1964-12-07,1965-03-15,"

Once I thought two happy hearts would someday be as one
But then a third heart came along and now our love is gone
I count the many times I said I love no one but you
But don't be fooled by counting dreams that never will come true
Subtract one love and multiply the heartaches
Divide the tears by everytime a heart breaks
The answer only tells that it's too late
Subtract one love and multiply the heartaches
--- Instrumental ---
Subtract one love and multiply the heartaches
Divide the tears by everytime a heart breaks
The answer only tells that it's too late
Subtract one love and multiply the heartaches
Subtract one love and multiply the heartaches...

Never thinking we'd miss each other so

And reap together the wild seeds we've sown
Surely they can forgive us in time

Everybody tells me you're a cheater
Yes and everybody says you cheated too
Should we believe them and let them tear our love apart
Or should we believe what's in our hearts

Side by side hand in hand we'll never be apart
Just as long as we believe what's in our hearts

Only your two lips could make me happy
And I'm sure you know I feel the same way too
Together we will share a tender love no one can part

And I'd never take a chance on losing you
Side by side hand in hand we'll never be apart

Glen Campbell,Dreams Of The Everyday Housewife,1968-07-01,1968-10-07,"

She looks in the mirror and stares at the wrinkles
That weren't there yesterday
And thinks of the young man that she almost married
What would he think if he saw her this way
She picks up her apron in little girl fashion as
Something comes into her mind
Then slowly starts dancing remembering her girlhood
And all of the boys she had waiting in line

Ah such are the dreams of the everyday housewife
You see everywhere anytime of the day
An everyday housewife who gave up the good life for me

The photograph album she takes from the closet and
Slowly turns the page
And carefully picks up the crumbling flower
The first one he gave her now withered with age
She closes her eyes and touches the house dress
That suddenly disappears
And just for a moment she's wearing the gown
That broke all their minds back so many years

Ah such are the dreams...

Ah such are the dreams...

Ah such are the dreams...

Glen Campbell,Everything A Man Could Ever Need,1970-07-13,1970-09-28,"

Looking back on the days
When I was scuffling for a buck
Not overly concerned with life and love
I was always feeling sorry
For myself and my bad luck
I never stopped to think what life's made of

With my nose to the grindstone
And my collar to the wheel
I fought for my daily dollar like a man
Then you came into my life
And nothing else seemed real
I found the answer right here in my hands

Now I've got everything a man could ever need
I've got dreams to dream and songs to sing
In the morning
I've got hands to hold my baby-child
And eyes to watch my woman smile
I've got everything a man could ever need

Now my working days seem shorter
Than they ever did before
And the evening breeze gets cooler day by day
And the morning sun is always shining
Down on my backdoor
And your laughter washes all my tears away

And there's not a day goes by
When I don't look up to the sky
And humbly thank the good Lord up above
For bringing you to me in time
To make me realize
That all a poor man really needs is love

Now I've got everything a man could ever need
I've got dreams to dream and songs to sing
In the morning
I've got hands to hold my baby-child
And eyes to watch my woman smile
I've got everything a man could ever need
I've got everything a man could ever need

While I watch the cannons flashing

I still see her standing by the water
Standing there lookin' out to sea
And is she waiting there for me?
On the beach where we used to run

Before I dry the tears she's crying
Before I watch your sea birds flying in the sun

Glen Campbell,Gentle On My Mind,1967-08-07,1968-10-28,"

It's knowing that your door is always open
And your path is free to walk
That makes me tend to leave my sleeping bag
Rolled up and stashed behind your couch
And it's knowing I'm not shackled
By forgotten words and bonds
And the ink stains that are dried upon some line
That keeps you in the backroads
By the rivers of my memory
That keeps you ever gentle on my mind

It's not clinging to the rocks and ivy
Planted on their columns now that bind me
Or something that somebody said
Because they thought we fit together walking
It's just knowing that the world will not be cursing
Or forgiving when I walk along some railroad track and find
That you're moving on the backroads
By the rivers of my memory
And for hours you're just gentle on my mind

Though the wheat fields and the clothes lines
And the junkyards and the highways come between us
And some other woman's cryin' to her mother
Cause she turned and I was gone
I still might run in silence, tears of joy might stain my face
And the summer sun might burn me 'til I'm blind
But not to where I cannot see you walkin' on the backroads
By the rivers flowing gentle on my mind

I dip my cup of soup back from a gurglin'
Cracklin' caldron in some train yard
My beard a rustling, cold towel, and
A dirty hat pulled low across my face
Through cupped hands 'round the tin can
I pretend to hold you to my breast and find
That you're waiting from the backroads
By the rivers of my memories
Ever smilin' ever gentle on my mind

Manhattan, Kansas ain't no place to have a baby
When you got no man to give it his last name
And her folks back in Manhattan didn't want her or her bundle
So she took her child and caught an evenin' train

She found a job in Denver washing dishes in a diner
At least it buys her baby milk to drink
He once told her she was pretty but the only ring it got her
Was the ring of grease that runs around the sink

Yes she lay beside him gentle
'Cause he told her that he loved her
And he made her dance before the music played
But at least she didn't beg him
She'd rather wash her dishes
It makes her feel as if her hands are clean

At night she stands there thinkin'
'Bout the man back home in Kansas
And how her folks just turned away the shame
She stares down through the soap suds
Reaches down and pulls the drain plug
And watches as Manhattan drains away

Yes she lay beside him gentle
'Cause he told her that he loved her

Her eyes were bathed in starlight
And her hair hung long
The last time she spoke to me
Her lips were like the scented flowers
Inside a rain-drenched forest

But that was so long ago
That I can scarcely feel the way I felt before
And if time could heal the wounds
I would tear the threads away
That I might bleed some more

The last time I walked with her
Her laughter was the steeple bells
That ring to greet the morning sun
A voice that the ground we walked upon
Those were good days

The last time I held her hand
Her touch was autumn spring
And summer and winter too
The last time I let go of her
She walked away into the night

I lost her in the misty streets
A thousand months, a thousand years
When other lips will kiss her eyes
A million miles beyond the moon, that's where she is

The last time I saw her face
Her eyes were bathed in starlight
And million miles beyond the moon, that's where she is

The last time I saw her face
Her eyes were bathed in starlight
And she was walked alone
The last time she kissed my cheek
Her lips were like the wilted leaves

Upon the autumn covered hills
Resting on the frozen ground
The seeds of love lie cold and still
Beneath a battered marking stone, it lies forgotten

Though summer seems far away
You will find the sun one day

If you see your brother standing by the road
With a heavy load from the seeds he's sowed
And if you see your sister falling by the way
Just stop and stay you're going the wrong way
You got to try a little kindness
Yes show a little kindness
Just shine your light for everyone to see
And if you try a little kindness
Then you'll overlook the blindness
Of narrow-minded people on the narrow-minded streets
Don't walk around the down and out
Lend a helping hand instead of doubt
And the kindness that you show every day
Will help someone along their way
You got to try a little kindness
Yes show a little kindness
Just shine your light for everyone to see
And if you try a little kindness
Then you'll overlook the blindness
Of narrow-minded people on the narrow-minded streets
You got to try a little kindness
Yes show a little kindness
Just shine your light for everyone to see
And if you try a little kindness
Then you'll overlook the blindness
Of narrow-minded people on the narrow-minded streets

Glen Campbell,Where's The Playground Susie,1969-05-12,1969-06-30,"

The end has come and found us here
With our toys scattered all around us here
The puzzle that we never found an answer for
Still asks us, darlin', just what all the games were for
And here we stand in a box of sand

Where's the playground Susie?
You're the one who's supposed to know her way around
Where's the playground Susie
If I don't stay around?
If I don't stay around?

The carousel has stopped us here
It twirled a time or two and then it dropped us here
And still you're not content with something about me
But what merry-go-round can you ride without me
To take your hand?
How would you stand?

Where's the playground Susie
If I decide to let you go and play around?
Where's the playground Susie
If I don't stay around?
If I don't stay around?

Where's the playground Susie?
You're the one who's supposed to know her way around
Where's the playground Susie
If I decide to let you go and play around?

{Intro}

I am a lineman for the county
And I drive the main road
Searchin' in the sun for another overload

I hear you singing in the wire
I can hear you through the whine
And the Wichita lineman
Is still on the line

{Hook}

I know I need a small vacation
But it don't look like rain
And if it snows that stretch down south
Won't ever stand the strain

And I need you more than want you
And I want you for all time
And the Wichita lineman
Is still on the line

{Bridge}

And I need you more than want you
And I want you for all time
And the Wichita lineman
Is still on the line

Winter's gone and summertime's a coming and where I am ain't where I wanna be
I can hear my southern home a calling and it's calling out the old wild goose and me
Flying flying south to Dixie Lord I been so lonesome and alone
Stayin' ain't no use because my heart's an old wild goose
And tomorrow I'll be flying south and home

I've got kids and kin down in Kentucky I've got lots of aunts in Alabam
Mom's a waitin' down in Mississippi and my sist's in Carolina's honey land
Grandma and grandpa's down in Georgia and my Tootsie's back in Tennessee

(From here to there to you)
From here to there to you my letter is on its way
To tell you how I miss you ever since you sailed away
To tell you things are not the same when I'm so far from you

Today has been my birthday and tonight I should be glad
But you weren't here to share it and inside I've hurt so bad
I didn't want your presence just your kiss and company
And your lips to softly whisper happy birthday to me
But I came home all by myself and lit the candle
Made a wish for you and love that used to be
I unwrapped the tiny package that I bought myself
Then I sang happy birthday to me

I thought for sure you sent me at least a birthday card
But the postman didn't even stop when he passed by my yard
You could have telephone and ease a lot of misery
Instead I called myself and said happy birthday to me
And I came home all by myself...

But she doesn't know all about me I'm just one step ahead of my past
Now I'm walking the old straight and narrow but yesterday's coming up fast

I was roaming round in Nashville in the state of Tennessee
For I love that country music it's as soulful as can be
I have gathered their the records for I cherished every name
So I found myself a standing in the Country Hall of Fame
My heart beat somewhat faster as I walked in through the door
For I heard the sound of voices I had often heard before
A happy kind of sadness brought a teardrop to my eye
Now I'll tell you what I saw there and I'm sure that you'll see why

Jimmie Rodgers' railroad lantern and his faithful old guitar
I could hear that old blue yodel coming from somewhere afar
Roy Acuff in bronze likeness with that great Fred Rose his friend
And I heard that Wabash Cannonball somewhere around the bend
The guitar of Eddy Arnold memories of Cattle Call
Chet Atkins will be with him when the work's all done this fall
From the autoharp of Maybelle Wildwood Flower seems to ring
Riley Puckett and Gid Tanner how they all could pick and sing

I could hear George Hay announcin' as I stood there in the room
I could hear Tex Ritter singing his classic song High Noon
Minnie Pearl so glad to be there and Hank Snow keeps Movin' On
May the Lord bless those still living and the ones who's joined his throne
Cowboy Copas Hankshaw Hawkins Gentleman Jim and Patsy Cline
Rod Bradsfield Ira Louvin these stars will always shine
Ernest Tubb and great Red Foley and Hank Williams bless his name
Though some are gone they'll live forever in the Country Hall of Fame

A Wooden Soldier
And a Doll of Clay~
Were brought together
In the Art Display
Then someone took them~~
Stood them apart
And the Wooden Soldier
Lost the battle for her heart
There came the day to retreat
To the border of heartbreak
Down came the stars~~
He lost his war~~
His world began to shake
And though they both were
A work of art~~
The Wooden Soldier lost the battle
For her heart
Music~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Wooden Soldier
And the Doll of Clay~~
Are like two people
I know today
You are my Dolly~~
And we're apart
And all because I lost the battle
For your heart
And though I had to retreat
To the border of heartbreak~~
It's no disgrace to have to pace
The hurt a love can make
It's not too late now for a new start~~
This Wooden Soldiers' gonna battle
For your heart!

And he sang hula Hawaii hula smile on your zing gang a zula

Hank Snow,I've Cried A Mile,1965-12-20,1966-03-21,"

Recorded by Hank Snow

Oh, the road of love is rocky, and it's lonely, and so blue
When the one you dream of, walks on ahead of you
Well, I laughed the day she left me, said she'd come back in awhile
But for every inch I've laughed, I've cried a mile

It's a mighty lonesome feeling, when you go to bed at night;
And there's nothing but a memory, and a pillow on your right
Oh, if men were born to suffer, then I guess I'm right in style
Cause for every inch I've laughed, I've cried a mile

Well, I laughed and said a new love would be easy to find;
I was right, they're so easy, and all the wrong kind
As I travel down life's highway, it hardly seems worthwhile
That for every inch I've laughed, I've cried a mile

It's a mighty lonesome feeling, when you go to bed at night;
And there's nothing but a memory, and a pillow on your right
Oh, if men were born to suffer, then I guess I'm right in style
Cause for every inch I've laughed, I've cried a mile

Made me feel I was unwanted like the birds and the bears in Miller's Cave

I said you'll pay both you and Davy I must see you in your graves
They laughed at me and then I shot 'em

I took you home from a party and we kissed in fun
A few stolen kisses and no harm was done
Instead of stoppin' when we could we went right on
Till suddenly we found the brakes were gone

You belong to someone else and I do too it's just crazy bein' here with you
As a bad motorcycle with the devil in the seat
Doin' ninety miles an hour down a dead end street
I didn't want to want you now I have no choice
It's too late to listen to the warning voice
All I hear is thunder when two hearts beat
Doin' ninety miles an hour down a dead end street
You're not free to belong to me and you know I can never be your own
Your lips on mine are like sweet sweet wine but we're headin' for a wall of stone
Warnin' signs are flashin' by us but we we pay no heed
Stead of slowin' down the pace we keep picking up the speed
Disaster's gettin' closer every time we meet
Doin' ninety miles an hour down a dead end street
You're not free...

Hank Snow,The Last Ride,1959-10-19,1960-02-29,"

In the Dodge City yards of the Sante Fe
Stood a freight made up for the east
And the engineer with his oil and waste
Was groomin' the great iron beast;

While ten cars back in the murky dust
A box-car door swung wide
And a hobo lifted his pal aboard
To start on his last, long ride;

A lantern swung and the freight pulled out
The engine it gathered speed
The engineer pulled the throttle wide
And clucked to his fiery steed;

Ten cars back in the empty box
The hobo rolled a pill
The flare of the match showed his partners' face
Stark white and deathly still;

As the train wheels clicked on the couplin' joints
A song for the ramblers' ears
The hobo talked to the still, white form
His pal for many a year;

For a mighty long time we've rambled, Jack
With the luck of men that roam
With the back door steps for a dining room
And the boxcar for a home;

We dodged the bulls on the eastern route
And the cops on the Chesapeake
We traveled the Leadville Narrow Gauge
In the days of Cripple Creek;

We drifted down through sunny Cal
On the rails of the old S. P
And of all you had, through good and bad
A half always belonged to me;

You made me promise to you, Jack
If I lived and you cashed in
To take you back to the old churchyard
And bury you there with your kin;

You seemed to know I would keep my word
For you said that I was wise
Well, I'm keepin my promise to you, pal
Cause I'm takin' you home tonight;

I hadn't the money to send you there
So I'm takin' you back on the 'fly'
It's the decent way for a Bo to go
Home to the by and by;

I knew that fever had you, Jack
And that doctor just wouldn't come
He was too busy treatin' the wealthy folks
To doctor a worn out bum;

As the train rolled over it's ribbon of steel
Straight through to the east it sped
The engineer in his high cab seat
Keep his eyes on the rails ahead;

While ten cars back in the empty box
The lonely hobo sighed
For the days of old and his pal so cold
Was taking his last long ride

Hank Snow,The Restless One,1961-10-09,1962-01-08,"

Words and Music by Hank Snow

This old train is speeding southbound and her whistle moans the blues;
And my heart's as cold as the ice and snow that fills these walkin' shoes
That old smoke-stack keeps barkin' back to me and seems to say:
We'll carry you on, oh, Restless One

I had mushed my way on a Husky sleigh, to the land of Midnight Sun;
And I kissed the squaw at the wigwam door, many times I faced a gun
Brown Eskimo didn't want me to go, when I told her I must run
And she gave me the name of the Restless One

Then I strolled into a tavern in that frozen land afar;
Where I met a beautiful Indian maid, she was known as the Morning Star
Her eyes were bright like the Northern Lights, when they chase the Arctic moon
And I knew she was born for the Restless One

As we danced I gently kissed her in the path of the morning sun;
Love was sweet and oh, so blissful, with a romance just begun
The Restless One had gone and fell in love with the Yukon Queen
And she fell in love with the Restless One

Through the door came an angry red-skin, on his head was a beaded band;
I was courtin' the wife of an Indian chief, who ruled with an iron hand
With a knife he run, but I pulled my gun and I shot him to the floor
Then the hunt began for the Restless One

Many days and nights they trailed me out under the northern sky;
Where the wild birds song was mournful and the timber wolf did cry
But they tracked me down and I'm Frisco bound, I've made my final run
It's the end of the line for the Restless One

Oh you may not believe, this tale it be true
And scoff at the well as you go by
But if you don't own a love of your own
One day you may peak in and try

You say you decided to leave me for him
Perhaps I could stop you, but chances are slim;
I just can't believe that it's over so fast
You take the future, and I'll take the past

You take the future and don't look for me
I'll be behind you with old memories
Hold on to your happiness and make it last
You take the future, and I'll take the past

You take the future and don't look for me

Hold on to your happiness and make it last
You take the future, and I'll take the past

Where theres dim lights and theres liqueur, theyll find you each night
The jukebox will be playing your favorite song tonight
Youre the loneliest fool thats living in your make believe world
Youre a honky tonk sweetheart and anybodys girl
Though you chose the life that lead you to sorrow and shame
Each shoulder that you cry on, you swear that Im to blame
You gave up the one that loved you to live in your sorted world
Youre a honky tonk sweetheart and anybodys girl
You cant say I didnt love you as youre crying in your beer
You drink to every heartache and wish that I was near
With each drink you passion surges and start your head to whirl
Youre a honky tonk sweetheart and anybodys girl
I dont understand your feelings but emotions are strange things
Why you gave up the life your leading and gave up your wedding ring
You flaunt your charms and beauty and toss your pretty curls
Youre a honky tonk sweetheart and anybodys girl
Youre a honky tonk sweetheart and anybodys girl

To keep the sunshine out
The beer is poured in a frosty cup
The good bartender cheers you up

Then watch your blues just fade away

I really didn't mean to ever fall in love with you
I knew eventually that you'd grow tired of me
That's why I tried so hard not to fall in love with you
To have a broken heart and my heart fall apart

I didn't want to give a fine desire to live
And now my dreams decay to see you walk away
The tears are stealing through I gave my very soul to you

Little Green Men hangin round my den and I sometimes wonder why
With their shaggy hair they sit and stare
Till my doggone bottle goes dry

I'm gonna have some fun, I'm gonna catch me one
I'm gonna sneaky little up behind
I said alakadab and made a lightning grab
And came up with my bottle of wine

I see them, I see them, don't tell me their not there
I see them, I see them, I see them everywhere

Well a 9 foot spider winked at me
Then tippie-toed right on by
She didn't even pause, and the reason because
She was chasing a 30 pound fly

An elephant pink crawled outta the sink and snuggled up in my bed
A striped ape in a big black cape
Is tapping on the top of my head

Chorus

Well a polkadot snake with a tennis shoe on
Just opened up a bottle of ale
And sittin' beside here was a sharks tooth tiger
With a gas tank on her tale
A purple mole's in the goldfish bowl, he's trying to steal a drink
And a grizzly bears in a rocking chair
Was fishing in a bottle of ink

OKLAHOMA HILLS
Writers Woody Guthrie, Jack Guthrie

Many months have come and gone since I wandered from my home
In those Oklahoma Hills where I was born
Many a page of life has turned many a lesson I have learned
Yet I feel like in those hills I still belong
Way down yonder in the Indian nation I rode my pony on the reservation
In the Oklahoma Hills where I was born
A-way down yonder in the Indian nation a cowboy's life is my occupation
In the Oklahoma Hills where I born
But as I sit here today many miles I am away
From the place I rode my pony through the draw
Where the Oak and Blackjack trees kiss the playful prairie breeze
In those Oklahoma Hills where I was born
Way down yonder in the Indian nation I rode my pony on the reservation
In the Oklahoma Hills where I was born
A-way down yonder in the Indian nation a cowboy's life is my occupation
In the Oklahoma Hills where I born
As I turn life a page to the land of the great Osage
To those Oklahoma Hills where I was born
Where the black oil rolls and flows and the snow-white cotton grows
In those Oklahoma Hills where I was born
Way down yonder in the Indian nation I rode my pony on the reservation
In the Oklahoma Hills where I was born
A-way down yonder in the Indian nation a cowboy's life is my occupation

Jukebox records play mid sorrow and cheer

Lots of them are happy, they laugh and tell their jokes
While lots of them are here because they're just lonely folks
And then there are others, who's hearts wear a scar
But you can't see them crying inside Smoky The Bar

Smoky The Bar lights glowing dim
They hardly notice when someone walks in
Order up your drink to the music that's loud
You'll find a friend some where in the crowd

While the ashes are falling from the smoke that you inhale
There's an old dream to recall or a new one that failed
Should a tear betray your eye, if a memory slips too far
Don't tell them that you're crying just say Smoky The Bar

Who lives along the Yukon far away
Where the Northern Lights they shine she rubs her nose to mine
She cuddles close and I can hear her say

Ooga ooga mooska which means that I love you
If you'll be my baby I'll ooga ooga mooska you
Then I take her hand in mine and set her on my knee
The squaws along the Yukon are good enough for me

She makes her underwear from hides of grizzly bear
And bathes in ice cold water every day
Her skin I love to touch but I just can't touch it much
Because her fur lined parka's in the way
Ooga ooga mooska...

She has the Air Corps down the Sourdoughs hang around
Chechakos try to date her night and day
With a landing gear that's fine and a fuselage divine
And a smile that you can see a mile away

Carry me back to old Alaska
The squaws along the Yukon are good enough for me

It seems you think that 45 is just a little too old now
But I'm not ready yet to be put out in the cold now

You know the older the violin the sweeter the music
And I can play a symphony of love
Like a thousand violins singing from above
You're gonna really miss my loving one day when you lose it
You know the older the violin the sweeter the music
These specks of gray that's in my hair just make me look distinguished
They don't mean I'm over the hill baby I'm not extinguished
There's plenty of young girl's waiting for my love honey they won't refuse it

Hear that lonesome whippoorwill
He sounds too blue to fly
The midnight train is whining low
I'm so lonesome I could cry

I've never seen a night so long
When time goes crawling by
The moon just went behind the clouds
To hide its face and cry

Did you ever see a robin weep
When leaves begin to die?
Like me, he's lost the will to live
I'm so lonesome I could cry

The silence of a falling star
Lights up a purple sky
And as I wonder where you are
I'm so lonesome I could cry

'Cause after all they used to all belong to me

Now there's our car
The one that I'm still paying for
And in the front yard
Lord, I see my little boy
And there's his mother
I hope she's doing fine
Oh Lord, I'd give anything
If they were all still mine
But they're not
And I'm the one to blame
I should have known I'd never win
When I played that cheating game
This other man holds my life
And my son calls him daddy tonight

But how can I complain?
'Cause after all they used to all belong to me
How can I complain?

Traced her footsteps down to the shore afraid she's gone for evermore

Why did we quarrel why did we fight why did I leave her alone tonight
That's why her footsteps ran into the sea that's why my baby has gone from me
I looked at the sea...

Ran in the water heart full of fear there in the breakers I saw her near
Reached for my darling held her to me stole her away from the angry sea

My heart cried out she's mine to keep I saved my baby from that endless sleep

(Don, tell us how it really was when you was working with daddy)
Well, in 1950, I took a little nip
Along with Mr Williams on the way to Mississippi
We were stacked eight deep in a Packard limousine
When we met this promoter in the town of New Orleans
Well the man told daddy he had what it took
And he liked the way he sang and he liked the way he shook
He said pretty soon he'd make us all rich
And we started believing that fat sumbitch
Now daddy told the man if you wanna make some dough
Take a little money and book me on a show
And we played them dates and we filled the places well
But Hank he done blowed the profit all to hell
Cause he'd run through a ten and he'd run through a twenty
And he'd run through a hundred just as hard as he could go
Like a big (unknown) to a little bitty feller
He'd spend a thousand dollars on a hundred dollar show
Hank looked at me with a funny looking grin
Said I been to the Opry and I'm going back again
We met the owner in a little office there
A big fat fella with some artificial hair
He told Hank he wanted half of everything he made
Or he'd have to tell Audrey bout some women Hank had laid
And you told daddy he'd better get smart
Get rid of them fellas and make a new start
Then he fired my ass and he fired Jerry Rivers
And he fired every body just as hard as he could go
He fired old Cedric and he fired Sammy Pruitt
And he fired some people that he didn't even know
Well every song he made it went to number one
Y'all was workin like hell and you was havin fun
We was ridin every day and playin every night
And every twenty minutes some of us had a fight
Now daddy he was makin money hand over fist
And y'all was getting screwed but you wasn't gettin kissed
Yeah I told him to pass a liitle bit around
But he said he'd rather send it to his folks in Alabama
So he fired your ass and he fired Jerry Rivers
And he fired everybody just as hard as he could go
He fired old Cedric and he fired Sammy Pruitt
And he fired some people that he didn't even know
Now the owner of the Opry he's doin pretty good
He's got a music company that they call Cedarwood
And Hank played nothin but sold out halls
And I was pumpin gas in greasy overalls
Cause he fired my ass and he fired Jerry Rivers
And he fired everybody just as hard as he could go
He fired old Cedric and he fired Sammy Pruitt
And he fired some people that he didn't even know
Hank'd run through a fifty and he'd run through a hundred
And he'd run through a thousand just as hard as he could go
Buying Cadillac coupes paying double alimony

And tomorrow night what do use the chest to take the place of your breast
Breast against my chest oh how I'll miss your tenderness but there's no use to cryin'
Cause love's a grown up game a little pleasure then a lot of pain
First we call each other bad names then what we have was never quite the same
I wish I could find eyes that won't cry lips that won't lie and love that won't die
Hmm hmm hmm hm and a love that won't die

Had our number changed today, although I hated to
But each time the phone would ring
They'ed want to speak to you
And it hurt's to tell them, your not here with me
May be now, oh telephone will let me be

It's not in the book now, so you'd better write it down
Just in case your love for me, should ever come around
You might want to call, and break the news to me
Just call lonesome 7-7203

I keep the telephone be side me all the time
Hoping you might want to call, and say
You've changed your mind
If you do then darling you know, where I'll be
I'm at lonesome 7-7203

Your the only one I'm giving our new number too
So now if the telephone should ring I'll know It's you
If you ever long for love that used to be
Just call lonesome 7-7203

Little kids sleepin' with rats in their bed well it's none of my business
It's been a long time since they've been fed but it's none of my business
Some more bad news from Vietnam and China's playin' with a great big bomb
I better take a pill to stay dumb cause it's none of my business

People are afraid to walk their own streets but it's none of my business
Cops can even walk on their beat but it's none of my business
I read about a girl I forgot her name she was screamin' for help but nobody came
It seems like kind of a shame but it's none of my business

Ten more billion on a national debt well it's none of my business
People in the slums are a little upset that's none of my business
Kids gripin' out of school lookin' for a thrill learnin' the law's kill or be killed
I better take another pill cause it's none of my business

Now the preacher's sayin' somethin' bout good man vow well it's none of my business
He said we got troubles that we gotta have sow oh it's none of my business
Now I go to church and I meditate I don't even mind when they pass the plate
But they stuff about my fellow man's fate well 's none of my business

Today the train pulled out of here that stops in my hometown
And the one I love is waiting for won't be there to step down
Right now they're braidin' rope to hang a man who's not to blame
Back home my love is waitin' she thinks I'm on that train

She'll be there if the sun is shinin' she'll be there if it's pourin' rain
She'll be there with little Jimmy a little man with my last name
But the angry town denied the cry of a stranger's alibi
She's just waitin' for the shattered dream she thinks I'm on that train

My cries out for all the unsaid things I'd like to say
The things I should have done will all be left undone today
I never knew until today that time's a precious thing
Back home my love is waitin' she thinks I'm on that train
She'll be there if the sun is shinin'...
She'll be there if the sun is shinin'...

Daddy hates mommy, mommy hates dad
Last night you should'a heard the fight they had
It gave little sister another bad dream
She woke us all up with a terrible scream

Skip a rope, skip a rope
Oh, listen to the children while they play
Now ain't it kind of funny what the children say?

Cheat on your taxes, don't be a fool
Now what was that they said about a golden rule?
Never mind the rule, just play to win
And hate your neighbor for the shade of his skin

Skip a rope, skip a rope
Oh, listen to the children while they play
Now ain't it kind of funny what the children say?

Stab 'em in the back that's the name of the game

A cryin' man prays for a peace in his land then raises his arm and closes his hand
To strike the face of the woman he wed children the number one prophet said

This generation shall not pass before that great day come

The man on the mountain said this last days would bring
Failing up hearts the downfall of kings
Hurt waits in wars and phantoms will spread children the number one prophet said

When the green leaves cover the big tree of life then understand that summer is nigh
Beware of the world it's blind and it's deaf children the number one prophet said

Homer And Jethro,The Battle Of Kookamonga,1959-10-19,1959-11-02,"

In nineteen and fifty-nine we took a little hike
With our scout master down to Lake Oneeganite
We took a little pizza and we took some saurkrauts
And we marched along together till we heard the girl scouts

[Chorus:]
We're the boys from Camp Kookamonga
Our mothers sent us here for to study nature's ways
We learned to make sparks by rubbing sticks together
But if we catch the girls then we'll set the woods ablaze

And I was mad because me mother sent me up here ha-ha-ha

Well we crept up to the water and we see the girls a-swimming
There must've been a hundred of them pretty young women
They looked so fine even birds forgot to sing
We lay down in the poison oak and didn't say a thing

[Chorus]
Hey will one of you fellas scratch my back?

Well our counselor said we could take them by surprise
If we didn't say a word till we looked them in the eyes
We kept real still and we had our eyes aglued
We saw how they were dressed they were swimming in the
Well now...

[Chorus]
Well they ran through the briars and they ran through the brambles
They ran through the bushes where a rabbit couldn't go
They ran so fast even we couldn't catch them
And we can even hike all the way to Buffalo

Hey fellas wait for me

Well we ran right after them till everyone was pooped
So we rested for a moment and our forces we regrouped
Then we saw the girls behind some evergreens
Captured by a company of United States Marines

[Chorus]
Aww those big guys get everything

Well they ran through the briars an they ran through the brambles
They ran through the bushes where a rabbit couldn't go
They ran so fast even we couldn't catch them
And we can even hike all the way to Buffalo

[Chorus]

Ah we are the boys from the boy scout troop
We don't smoke and we don't chew
And we don't go with the girls that do

(And) When the morning comes and you gotta get up
How you going to find your shoes
In an empty bed with an achin' head
You know its got to give you the blues

I don't know what's going on here
I know things are not all right
If you want me to I'll go dear
If you want I'll stay all night
I came here with my broken heart
Wrapped away with care
And all you do is sit and drink
And stare ---- at your T V

Chorus

You ask me why I came here
But you're the one who phoned
I wasn't very happy
But I did alright a lone
I thought you learned to love me
I guess you never will
The key's lost to the kingdom
And I don't have time to kill

He's a big ugly Mammal and he's very very hairy
All the Shieks know he's a swinging Dromedary uhhuh oh yeah

They say that you can see him stompin' up and down the dunes
He's a big raunchy cat but he swings right along
Groovin' to the beat of a Nashville song uhhuh oh yeah
Talkin' bout Humphrey the Camel

Everybody digs Humphrey the Cammel come see Camel Humphrey the Camel
But he's a body jumper a real hip humper talkin' bout Humphrey the Camel
Down at the Oasis the Arabs were pickin' their dates

Somewhere in Virginia in the rain

And I won't make the same mistakes again
My left front window's busted got a patch with cellophane
Somewhere in Virginia in the rain
I know it must be two a.m. bout Lewitt Mountain time
I'm here in telephone booth underneath the lonesome pine
And I've only got three minutes cause I'm down to my last dime
I hope it's not too late to say I'm sorry

If I woke you up it's just to let you know somebody loves you

Take away the trees and the birds
All have to sit upon the ground, uum
Take away their wings and
The birds will have to walk to get around
And take away the bird baths
And dirty birds will soon be ev'rywhere
Take away their feathers and
The birds will walk around in underwear
Take away their chirp and the
Birds will have to whisper when they sing
And take away their common sense and
They'll be headed southward in the spring

[Chorus]
Oh remember my darling
When spring is in the air
And the bald headed birds
Are whispering everywhere
You can see them walking
Southward in their dirty underwear
That's Tennessee Bird walk

How about some trees so the birds
Won't have to sit upon the ground, uum
How about some wings so the
Birds won't have to walk to get around
And how about a bird bath or two
So the birds will all be clean
How about some feathers so their
Underwear no longer can be seen
How about a chirp so the birds
Won't have to whisper when they sing
And how about some common sense so they
Won't be blocking traffic in the spring

As if they're stamped on from the mold
Somehow it seems to be the only change is you and me
There must be more to life than growing old
There must be more to life than growing old

Somewhere there should be for all the world to see
A statue of a fool made of stone
An image of a man who let love slip through his hands
And then just let him stand there all alone

And there on his face, a gold tear should be placed
To honor the million tears he's cried
And the hurt in his eyes would show, so everyone would know
Concealed is a broken heart inside

So, build a statue and oh build it high so that all can see
Then inscribe: The World's Greatest Fool, and name it after me

And who can measure the treasure the oceans hold
But whether it be underneath the sea or the sky above
There is no treasure like the treasure of your love

There was a time when I thought I could find happiness in silver and gold
And I longed for fame and wordly acclaim
And I've hungered for these things filled my very soul
But then you came along and now I know I was wrong
For in your eyes I can see the greatest treasure in all the world
The treasure of your love for me

Cause bad seed won't grow just anywhere
And you're looking at the baddest of the bad seed

Don't think that other men don't look at me that certain way from time to time
Don't think that you're the only one that must conted with evil on your mind
Your mind is in the hare man surrounded by exotic dancing girls

But hurting's not heaven it's more like someplace else

Seven lonely days make one lonely week seven lonely nights make one lonely me
Ever since the time you told me we were through
Seven lonely days I've cried and cried for you

Oh my darling I'm crying hoo hoo hoo hoo
There's no use in denying I've cried for you
What's your favorite past time just a making me blue
Last week was the last time I cried for you

Seven hankies blue I filled with my tears seven letters too I filled with my fears
Guess it never paced to make your lover blue
Cause seven lonely days I've cried and cried for you
Oh my darling I'm crying hoo hoo hoo hoo...
Seven lonely days make one lonely week...
Seven lonely days make one lonely week...

Monday's promise is Tuesday's lie Saturday's party is Sunday's fight
Somethin's wrong with you and I love's gone wrong that used to be right
And I can feel it slippin' away slowly slowly slippin' away
It'll be gone in a few more days if we don't stop this love of ours from slippin' away

Wednesday's kisses are Thursday's frowns we can't live two days in a row
When our world's not upside down here we stand watchin' it go
And I can feel it slippin' away...

Roses are red violets are blue sugar is sweet some of the time
This puzzle's missin' a piece or two we've got the grapes but never the wine
And I can feel it slippin' away...
And I can feel it slippin' away...
And I can feel it slippin' away...

Jean Shepard,Someone's Gotta Cry,1965-05-31,1965-07-12,"

Someone's gotta cry when love is over and as you leave it's very plain to see
You're not about to cry for you're in love again
But someone's gotta cry and that leaves me
There's very little left to say the goodbyes have been said
But anytime a true love dies a few tears must be shed
Someone's gotta cry that makes it final and in her arms is where you wanna be
You smile at her she smiles at you you're happy
But someone's gotta cry and that leads me

There's very little left to say...

Jean Shepard,Then He Touched Me,1969-12-29,1970-03-30,"

There was a time when I felt I'd never love again for hurt had taken all my love away
My faith was gone and I knew I'd never trust another man
And loneliness was in my life to stay
Not long ago I met a man he was so good to me I never thought of him as one to love
He always seemed to be around when I needed company
He made my world a better place to live
The other day I noticed he was staring at me his eyes looked at me as if to say
I know that you're a woman starved for love and tenderness
You need the love that only I can give
Then he touched me and my world started turnin' once again
When he kissed me my lips started burnin' once again
When he held me my feet just wouldn't touch the ground
Now my world's so bright for there's love all around
Now my world's so bright for there's love all around

So this time let's use my forever cause your forevers don't last very long

I've been waiting here tonight but not alone
You broke the date that we had made just yesterday
Now there's someone else who's here, he'll have to stay

I have found another love I know is true
And he holds me much more tenderly than you
Loving you's not worth the price I have to pay
Someone else is in your place, he'll have to stay

Once I loved you with all my heart
But now I must say no
You broke my heart too many times
So now you'll have to go

I can hear the jukebox playing soft and low
And you're out again with someone else, I know
My love was blind, I'm not your kind that's all I'll say
So you can hang up, I'm in his arms, he'll have to stay

To be with my people my man and my kids
To live in a house about a mile down the road from mama's
Oh Lord what I'd give to be a country girl again

To go walking down a country road at sunset
And see colors I could almost touch right over head

And the love once burning bright now burns so dim

I wanna tell you all the story 'bout
A Harper Valley widowed  wife
Who had a teenage daughter
Who attended Harper Valley Junior High
Well her daughter came home one afternoon
And didn't even stop to play
And she said mom, I got a note here from the Harper Valley PTA

Well the note said Mrs. Johnson
You're wearin' your dresses way too high
It's reported you've been drinking
And a-running round with men and goin' wild
And we don't believe you oughta be a-bringin' up
Your little girl this way
And it was signed by the Secretary
Harper Valley PTA

Well, it happened that the PTA was gonna meet
That very afternoon
And they were sure surprised
When Mrs. Johnson wore her miniskirt into the room
And as she walked up to the blackboard
I can still recall the words she had to say
She said I'd like to address this meeting of the Harper Valley PTA

Well there's Bobby Taylor sittin' there
And seven times he asked me for a date
And Mrs. Taylor sure seems to use a lotta ice
Whenever he's away
And Mr. Baker can you tell us why
Your secretary had to leave this town?
And shouldn't widow Jones be told to keep
Her window shades all pulled completely down

Well, Mr Harper couldn't be here
'Cause he stayed too long at Kelly's Bar again
And if you smell Shirley Thompson's breath
You'll find she's had a little nip of gin
And then you have the nerve to tell me
You think that as a mother I'm not fit
Well this is just a little Peyton Place
And you're all Harper Valley hypocrites

No, I wouldn't put you on because it really did
It happened just this way

There are the roses and there are the thorns
There's a time for happiness and there's a time to mourn
There's a time to love then when love is faded and worn
Oh oh instead of the roses there are the thorns

Once there was spring and the flowers were gentle and sweet
I inhaled the goodness of love and my life was complete
I reached for a rose and its petals were crushed by my touch
Oh oh I love too hard and the thorns are now hurtin' too much

Winter comes on with no mercy for those unpreapared
Coldness creaps in on a heart that a dead love needs bared
Loving too much leaves a wreckage like that of a storm
Yes it does instead of the roses now I am holding the thorns

Roses and thorns so close together they grow
Fladness and sadness emotiones that everyone knows
When there is one the other can't be far behind oh no
I've held the rose and the stem with the thorns is now mine

Roses and thorns so close together...

On the back side of Dallas
In the dingy bar on a wornout stool she sits
And her trembling hand trembles
For another kingside filter cigarette

She blows a puff of smoke
Then settles back and look across that light blue haze
And from the back side of Dallas
Her mind goes driftin' back to other days

Meet me in Dallas on June the 23rd
His letter read
On the greyhound of this big town
She came to be with him just like he said
Then suddenly he left her for reasons
That she still don't understand
And on the back side of Dallas
A girl must turn her way as best as she can

It's a long way to Dallas
For a small town girl from the middle of Tennessee
A tenth grade education won't get you no kinda job here in big D
Hunger pains and prides
Are things that just don't go hand in hand for long
And on the back side of Dallas
A hungry small town girl can't find a home

On the back side of Dallas
Nervously she takes another pill
On the back side of Dallas
Tonight like other nights
She drinks her fill

She pays the man behind the bar
And leave the change for twenty dollar bill
If you're ever feeling lonesome, man
You want to find someone who feels the same
She's on the back side of Dallas
Where every taxi driver knows her name
She's on the back side of Dallas
Where every taxi driver knows her name

And I was a ""Little Miss Nothin'""

Ain't reason enough to have to treat you like a king

And it might as well be today
Baby you ain't worth the price I pay to stay

I'm tired of tryin' to turn the other cheek to you
And never knowin' which way to turn

There was a time
We'd sit in the backyard 'cause the house would get so hot
From the summer sun
There was no way of sleeping
And you'd play your old guitar
We'd fight mosquitos and enjoy

You backyard concerts for we had no television
We'd just begun our life
As man and wife and hardships then
Could scarcely scare us into quitting

Things were far from being fine
We often dined upon a dime
But there never was a time we didn't love

And that Christmas brought our saddest days
When your pride gave way when you told the kids
There'd be no gifts cause we were broke
Though their little tears of grief were so hard to see
It didn't hurt me

Like the lump I knew was in your throat
It was then with arms entwined
We both broke down and cried
For it seemed like nothing good would ever come
The doctor bills we couldn't pay
They came and took our car away
But there never was a time we didn't love

Now there's an easy chair for my back
A satin pillow for my head
And the kids are wild about the brand new car
You and I can order steak with all the trimmings and not worry

If we've spent a dollar more than we can spare
No wonder in our prayers
We've thanked the man upstairs who led us through
The years of raising kids and paying bills

And I think he guided us
Not because we were smart but just because
There never was a time we didn't love
No there never was a time never was a time
There never was a time we didn't love

Her face looks tired and hurried
And she just told me that she couldn't go on
The man she married for money has found another honey
And that great big nice house has just become an ice house
And she gets tired of staying all alone

But things go better with love things go better with love
It's made of something nothing else is made of
Things go better with love things go better with love
And life is much more fun when you're in love

Well, I wrecked your new car last week
Last night it rained
And the roof leaked
But the rain on the window pane made a soothing sound

In any situation
We've got a firm foundation
When it's hard to pay the mortage
Why we don't mind the shortage

Cause we've got all that love to spread around
Cause things go better...

No more standing in your way of looking for that special someone
No more wishing for what's never going to be

Of the parts we've learned to play
Never quite together like before

Got lost along the way

One has my name, and the other has my heart
With one I'll remain, that's how my heartaches start
One has brown eyes, the other's eyes are blue
To one I am tied, to the other I am true

But what, good is love, to an old heart that can't be free
So I'll go on living, my life just the same
While one has my heart, the other has my name

""Ah,one has my name , the other has my heart
With one I'll remain, ah that's how my old heartaches start
You know ones got brown eyes, and the other's eyes are blue
To one I am tied, to the other I guess I'll have to be true""

Morning's come and, Lord, my mind is aching, yes it is
Sunshine standing quietly at my door
Just like the dawn, my heart is silently breaking
With my tears it goes tumbling to the floor

Once again the whole town will be talking, yes they will
Lord, I've seen the pity that's in their eyes
They could never understand
It's her sorrow, it's not a man
And no matter what they say, we know she tried

Baby's packed her soft things and she's left me, she's left me, she's left me
And I know she didn't mean to make me cry
It's not her heart, Lord, it's her mind
She didn't mean to be unkind
Why she even woke me up to say goodbye

It's not her heart, Lord, it's her mind
She didn't mean to be unkind
Why she even woke me up to say goodbye

But then when the party's over and the good is all she sees
Though I let her down she still comes around just to love what's left of me

Six days out of seven I work hard at doing right
But believe me you could set your watch on any Friday night
But then I'm lucky she understands and the fool that lives in me
Though I let her down she still comes around to love what's left of me

The way I'm living it's a wonder she can take it
But that woman she's got a heart of gold it's justing me to break it
I know I don't deserve her but I'm thankful as can be

Alright, watch out

Now my daddy was hard shelled Alabama preacher
My momma was a dedicated Sunday school teacher
My brother went to college and got a PhD
Daddy said the only dud in the family was me

He said, ""Boy, you ain't never going to amount to a thing
You set around with that silly looking guitar and sing
You hang around them juke joints all the time
Making music like some wild man done lost his mind""

Going sock it to me
Well, what's that supposed to mean
Boy, you just a wild man

Well, then one day Daddy told me
""Boy, I've had enough now you just
Pack up that guitar, you just pack up your stuff""
So I left home and organized myself a band
Called myself the Alabama Wild Man

Well, I worked all them joints from the east to the west
Never making no money and a starving to death
A living on coffee and cold sardines
Soda crackers and pork n beans

But I finally went to Music City USA
Said I'm the Alabama Wild Man and I'm here to stay
Took my guitar and showed 'em what I'm talking about
So we made a little record and we put it out

With me going
Sock it to me, honey
Haha, hook it, boy
Play that guitar

Well, now I'm driving, the Cadillac's a city block long
The Alabama Wild Man could do no wrong
'Cause I'm selling them records
And I'm working them shows
And people love me everywhere I go

But a funny thing happened about a week or so back
I was a showing my hometown and the place was packed
Guess who was sitting on the front row seat
Was my daddy grinning up at me batting at me

Yelling
""Sock it your daddy, Wild Man
Hook it boy, hook it
Play that guitar, show 'em, son""

""Yeah, that's my boy, alright
Taught him everything he knows
Bought him his first guitar
Ah, sock it to your daddy, son""

""Go ahead put it to me, put it to me
Keep them checks coming in, boy
We going to pave the drive next week""

Now Amos Moses was a Cajun
He lived by his self in the swamp
He hunted alligator for livin'
He just knock 'em in the head with a stump
The Louisiana law gonna get you Amos!
It ain't legal huntin' alligator down in the swamp boy!

[Verse 2]
Now everybody blamed his old man
For makin' him mean as a snake
When Amos Moses was a boy
His Daddy would use him for alligator bait
Tie a rope around his waist and throw him in the swamp
Alligator bait in the Louisiana Bayou

[Chorus]
About forty-five minutes southeast of Thibodeaux, Lousisiana
Lived a man called Doc Milsap and his pretty wife Hanna
Well they raised up a son
Who could eat up his weight in groceries
Named him after a man of the cloth
Called him Amos Moses

[Verse 3]
Now the folks around south Louisiana
Said Amos was a hell of a man
He could trap the biggest, the meanest alligator
And just use one hand
That's all he got left cuz alligator bit it!
Left arm gone clean up to the elbow!

[Verse 4]
Well the Sheriff got wind that Amos
Was in the swamp tracking alligator skin
So he snuck in the swamp, gonna get the boy
But he never come out again
Well I wonder where the Louisiana Sheriff went to?
Well you can sure get lost in the Louisiana Bayou!

[Chorus]
About forty-five minutes southeast of Thibodeaux, Lousisiana
Lived a cat called Doc Milsap and his pretty wife Hanna
Well, they raised up a son
Who could eat up his weight in groceries
Named him after a man of the cloth,
Called him Amos Moses

Jerry Reed,Another Puff,1972-01-17,1972-02-28,"

I know there's a lotta talk going around today
About cigarette smoking whittling your life away
I've seen it and I've heard it so many times
That finally it just started to prey on my mind
I guess it scared me a little bit
That's why I decided I was gonna quit
So while I was sitting here forming my battle plan
I took another puff and turned on the fan
I just sat there in my easy chair
And thought of all the money I'd wasted on cigarettes all these years
I thought how I'd spend the rest of my days
After I kick this habit my body craves
Said to myself this ain't gonna be so tough
With that little bit of assurance
I took another puff

I took a puff, a puff, then I ripped off another puff
I decided I'd about had about enough
That breaking this habit won't be too tough

Now I've give a lot of thought to this thing
If I didn't smoke cigarettes I'd feel just like a king
Besides with the price going up every day
I knew I was just throwing all my good money away
You know I ain't lit one in an hour or so?
Just wanted to make sure I could quit you know
I was thinking maybe I oughta write all this down
Put it in a song kinda circulate it around
Can't ever tell it might make a hit
And that redneck Hall did a little bit
Can you imagine me a hit songwriter!
Now where's... Where'd I put that cigarette lighter?
After all it's a habit and a habit you can break
Just a little bit of willpower son that's all it takes
I said to myself you got to be tough!
And with that little bit of wisdom
I took another puff

I took a puff, and then a puff, then I finally ripped off another puff
And I decided boy this ain't gonna be tough
Besides I'd just about had enough
I'm about ready to quit this rotten habit anyway

Oh I think they ought to take it offa television
It looks too good! Ow!
I like them skinny ones with the filter
Oh give it to me! Give it to me!
Cigarettes... I say if I quit smoking what'll I do?
Maybe I'll eat
Yeah I'll eat cigarettes
Ahh, I love it I love it I love it I love it I love it I love it
Chester B don't smoke, he smokes logs!
Makes you laugh funny too
Oh my throat's scratchin', oh
I wish I could think of something bad to say about cigarettes
Boo on cigarettes, don't smoke don't smoke don't smoke
You quit smoking that'll leave more for me!
I love it I love it, no I don't love cigarettes ya know
Don't misunderstand me I hate cigarettes
Makes ya cough, and when ya don't smoke it makes ya shake
I don't know what's worse, the shake or the cough
I think I'll make me a coughshake, oh!
Son did you ever smoke?
Oh I remember one time I quit smoking
I quit for three months
My wife left me
So did my children
She took my house and left
It was a mobile home

Well, if you're one of the millions who own one of them gas-drinking, piston-clanking, air-polluting, smoke-belching, four-wheeled buggies from Detroit City, then pay attention
I'm about to sing your song son

[Verse 1]
Well, I'm not a man appointed judge
To bear ill-will and hold a grudge
But I think it's time I said me a few choice words
All about that demon automobile
A metal box with the polyglass wheel
The end result of the dream of Henry Ford

[Verse 2]
Well I've got a car that's mine alone
That me and the finance company own
A ready-made pile of manufactured grief
And if I ain't out of gas in the pouring rain
I'm a-changin' a flat in a hurricane
I once spent three days lost on a cloverleaf

[Verse 3]
Well it ain't just the smoke and the traffic jam
That makes me the bitter fool I am
But this four-wheel buggy is
A-dollarin' me to death
For gas and oils and fluids and grease
And wires and tires and antifreeze
And them accessories
Well honey, that's something else

[Verse 4]
Well you can get a stereo tape and a color TV
Get a back-seat bar and reclining seats
And just pay once a month, like you do your rent
Well I figured it up and over a period of time
This four thousand dollar car of mine
Costs fourteen thousand dollars
And ninety-nine cents, well now

[Chorus]
Lord Mr. Ford, I just wish that you could see
What your simple horseless carriage has become
Well it seems your contribution to man
To say the least, got a little out of hand
Well, Lord Mr. Ford what have you done

[Verse 5]
Now the average American father and mother
Own one whole car and half another
And I bet that half a car is a trick to drive, don't you
But the thing that amazes me, I guess
Is the way we measure a man's success
By the kind of automobile he can afford to buy

[Verse 6]
Well now, red light, green light, traffic cop
Right turn, no turn, must turn, stop
Get out the credit card honey, we're out of gas
Well now, all the cars placed end to end
Would reach to the moon and back again
And there'd probably be some poor fool who'd pull out to pass

[Verse 7]
Well now, how I yearn for the good old days
Without that carbon dioxide haze
A-hanging over the roar of the interstate
Well if the Lord that made the moon and the stars
Would have meant for me and you to have cars
He'd have seen that we was all born with a parking space

Every night I go down to this same little joint
Fill up my glass till I reach the point past remembering
Where the music is loud the conversation is free
A dance or two with someone to keep me from remembering
The fool I've been the hurt I've caused the good woman that I loved and lost
For she's constantly with me in memory
I go home but I couldn't sleep and after hours I'd be walkin' the streets remembering
A good woman's love is hard to find and my woman's love was just that kind
And I'm the reason that she's gone today
I miss her so and the price that I pay is remembering
I take her to sleep in my dreams every night
Then start all over in the morning light remebering
The way it was when she loved me then like a fool how I carelessly
Broke her heart then watched my world fall apart
I'd give this world for yesterday just to have her love me the way I remember
Just to have her love me the way I remember

Yesterdays
Oh, how many do you wish you could relive?
Turn the page and go back
Oh, I wonder what you'd give?

Looking back, does it seem
That when you've planned
And when you've dreamed
You forgot the most important thing

Smell the flowers while the roses bloom
Take the time my friend and sing a happy tune
Oh, how precious every mile, so take a minute, learn to smile
My friend, let's stop a while and smell the flowers
Smell the flowers

Got a troubled mind, friend
Did you let too much worry rule your days?
When you look back
Do you feel like something precious slipped away?

Oh, my friend are you the man
That the world slip through your hands?
Can you remember
When you smelled the flowers?

Smell the flowers while the roses bloom
Take the time my friend and sing a happy tune
You won't have this day again 'cause every road has got to end

Huh, yeah
Here we come

Well I remember when I was just children
A time when people used to treat the neighbor like a fellow man
And all their singin' and their big prayer meetin's
When a man was proud to walk up and shake his neighbor's hand

Oh, You talk about the good times, talk about the good times
Oh, if you ever needed help, a friend was there
Some good neighbor, helped lift your burdens
Oh and the simple joys of life your friends would share

But the times are harder and the people are changin'
Today most folks couldn't tell you, who their next door neighbors are
All the guns are loaded, the front doors are bolted
Ain't this ol' world takin' hate and fear just a little too far

Let's talk about the good times, let's talk about the good times
I wish, I could just go back to the days I'm speakin' of
When a friend would meet you and a smile would greet you
What this ol' world needs now is old fashioned love

Play the guitar
Well alright

Well, my old granddaddy, God rest his soul now
Well we had a big long talk together the day he died
He said, ""Son this world is so full of hate and venom
An' I can't wait to leave this ol' place and rest on the other side""

""Oh, you talk about the good times, talk about the good times
When I'm gonna see all the friends I knew in the good ol' days
We'll have a big hand shakin', sit and talk together
Sit down by the river Jordan and sing our blues away""

Well now Bill Jackson went to poor ol' Dub
To join the Uptown Poker Club
And he cursed the day he ever told anybody he joined
Cause his money used to go like it had wings
When he had queens somebody else had kings
And every night he'd just sit there donatin' all his coins

He said boys now I'm gonna play it right tonight
I'm gonna watch them cards and I'm gonna play 'em tight
And then when I come in there son my hand's gonna be a peach
Well he played 'em tight but after awhile
He done lost his self a considerable pile
So he got mad he stood up and he made this little speech

Now boys you see this razor well I had it sharpened just today
Now I'm comin' in here with my rules that everybody gonna follow when they play
Now you Clyde you keep your hands on top of the table when you're dealing please
Quit takin' them little wild cards and stickin' em down there between your knees
And Jesse quit makin' all them funny signs like you tryin' to tip off your hand
You better talk to me in American son American so's I can understand
And Leroy quit takin' em offa the bottom ooh that's rough
Just take five off the top then stop that's enough
Then pass me them cards son let me cut on them things every time before you deal
I like to handle them things boy I like to see
Cause I got news for you lad you ain't playin' this game accordin' that fella Hoyle there
Uh uh no tonight you're playin' this game accordin' to me

Well now a sittin' around the table in that there game
There just happened to be this ol' one-eyed man
And Bill kept watchin' him out of the corner of his eye
This old one-eyed cat he'd been dealin' kinda funny
He done took a whole bunch of big Bill's money
So Bill rose up and he looked around the room and with a sigh

He said hmm said it's an awful shame
Said there's somebody cheatin' in this here game
Said of course it ain't gonna do for me to stand up here and mention the guy
So I'll refrain from calling that party's name
But you let me catch him cheatin' just once again
And I'm gonna take my fist and Im gonna close that other eye

Now you see this razor well I had it sharpened just today
Now I'm comin' in here with my rules that everybody must follow when they play
Now Clyde you keep them bony hands up here on top of the table when you're dealin' please
Don't go takin' them little wild aces stickin' em off down there between your knees
And Jesse cut out makin' all them monkey signs you still tryin' to tip off your hand
You better talk to me in American big AA so's I can understand
And Leroy quit takin' em off the bottom of the deck son I tell ya that's rough
This is an army game son take five then halt that's enough
Then pass me them face cards over here let me cut them things every time before you deal
Cause I like to delve in there son I got to see
Cause I got news for you boys you ain't playin this game accordin' to that fella Hoyle there
Uh uh tonight you're playin' this game accordin' to me

Now then seein' as how you all know that I didn't ride in here on a head of cabbage
Henry if you'll break out another deck of them Bicycles me and the boys will get on with the business

Ha ha if he ain't careful somebody around this table liable to jack his jaw

Tupelo Mississippi Flash

I'm gonna tell you a story that's all about
This job I had one time as a talent scout, hmm

I had a hard day at the office and the boss wasn't in town
The day this hired legged guitar picker just happened to come around

Well, he walks in my office with a great big grin
And folks that's where my story really begins

He said, ""Son my name is Boregard Rippy
I come to you from Tupelo Mississippi
I write songs that'll sing like a bird
I play licks on my guitar like you ain't never heard

But I'm down on my luck and things are just a little slack
I gotta quarter in my pocket and a shirt on my back
But you buy me some supper and give me a place I can sleep
He said ""I'll sing you some songs that'll rock your head to sleep
I got talent boy. Said back home they call me the Tupelo Mississippi Flash

Well I knew I was in a room with some kind of a nut
When he pulled out that pack of used cigarette butts
So that's when I told him ""We can't use you today""
So I handed the boy a dollar and sent him on his way

Well the boss got back and we both had a laugh
When I told him 'bout the Tupelo Mississippi Flash
And pretty soon I had the story circling around
About this Mississippi nut that we had in our town

I said, ""watch him everybody, the boy's squirrelly!
He walks around calling himself the Tupelo Mississippi Flash.""

Well it happened one day while I was driving to my home
I just happened to have my car radio on
When I heard the jockey raving about a brand new smash
By a kid called the Tupelo Mississippi Flash

I almost wrecked my automobile
I went through a red light
I hit the traffic cop....Why??

Well my story's got an ending and it's short and sweet
The boss man he fired me and left me out in the street
But I got a new job now and I'm as learnin' real fast
I'm drivin' the bus for the Tupelo Mississippi Flash

And his Cadillac I'm driving that for him too
And that yacht he's got
And is there a plane??
Well chauffeur, chauffeur I hear him say
Tupelo Mississippi, who ever heard of it...........

Well, now me and Homer Jones and Big John Talley
Had a big crap game goin' back in the alley
And I kept rollin' them sevens, winnin' all them pots

My luck was so good, I could do no wrong
I just kept on rollin' and controllin' them bones
And finally they just threw up their hands and said
""When you hot, you hot"", I said, ""Yeah""

When you're hot, you're hot
And when you're not, you're not
Put all the money in an' let's roll 'em again
When you're hot, you're hot
La la la la la la, la la la la la
La la la la la la, when you're hot, you're hot

Well, now every time I rolled them dice I'd win
And I was just gettin' ready to roll 'em again
When I heard somethin' behind me
I turned around and there was a big old cop

He said ""Hello, boys"", and then he gave us a grin an' said
""Look like I'm gonna hafta haul you all in
An' keep all that money for evidence""
I said, ""Well, son when you hot, you hot"", he said, ""Yeah""

When you're hot, you're hot

You can 'splain it all down at City Hall

La la la la la la, la la la la la
La la la la la la, when you're hot, you're hot

Well, when he took us in to court, I couldn't believe my eyes
The judge was a fishin' buddy that I recognized
I said, ""Hey, judge, old buddy, old pal
I'll pay ya that hundred I owe ya, if you'll get me outta this spot""

So he gave my friends a little fine to pay
He turned around an' grinned at me an' said
""Ninety days, Jerry, when you hot, you hot""
An' I said, ""Thanks a lot""

When you're hot, you're hot
And when you're not, you're not
He let my friends go free and throwed the book at me
He said, ""Well, when you're hot, you're hot""

I said, ""Well, I'll tell ya one thing, judge, old buddy, old pal
If you wasn't wearin' that black robe
I'd take out in back of this courthouse
And I'd try a little bit of your honor on""

You took all the ramblin' out of me girl
With the finest lovin' I ever done seen
Now all I wanna do is sit home and play my little guitar
And sing songs about all the places that I've seen

Your country loving and your country cooking
Done blowed my mind and set me free
You took away all my urge to roam
All I wanna do is just hang around home
Cause you took all the ramblin' out of me

How I wound up down here in Monroe
Somethin' I'm never gonna figure out it's true
But your sweet love settled me down
Made me quit all my travelin' round
Now all I wanna do is sit home and grow old with you

Last night I heard a freight train through my window
And I couldn't help thinkin' as I heard that whistle scream
How that old lonesome sound don't make me itch and want to move around
Cause you took all the ramblin' out of me

You took all the ramblin' out of me girl...
Your country loving and your country cooking...
You took all the ramblin' out of me girl...

Breaking all ties that bind me to get to you
I hold your love far above what I go through
I would give all I own for a steppin stone
Just to get to you

If its the last thing I do I'll get to you
Just because I know just how much you want me to
You're the only thing that can bring my world in view
Every breath I take every move I make

Jim & Jesse,Ballad Of Thunder Road,1967-09-25,1967-10-02,"

Now let me tell a story, I can tell it all
About the mountain boy who ran illegal alcohol
His daddy made the whiskey, the son, he drove the load
And when his engine roared, they called the highway thunder road

Sometimes into Ashville, sometimes Memphis Town
The revenuers, they chased him, but they couldn't run him down
Each time they thought they had him, his engine would explode
He'd go by like they were standing still on thunder road

There was thunder, thunder over thunder road
Thunder was his engine and white lightning was his load
There was moonshine, moonshine to quench the devil's thirst
The law they swore they'd get him, but the devil got him first

On the first of April, 1954
The federal man sent word, he better make his run no more
He said 200 agents were covering the state
Whichever road he'd try to take, they'd get him sure as fate

""Son"", his daddy told him, ""Now make this run your last
Your tank is filled with 100 proof, you're all tuned up and gassed
Now don't take any chances, if you can't get through
I'd rather have you back again than all that mountain dew""

There was thunder, thunder over thunder road
Thunder was his engine and white lightning was his load
There was moonshine, moonshine to quench the devil's thirst
The law they swore they'd get him, but the devil got him first

Roaring out of Harlan, revving up his mill
He shot the gap at Cumberland and screamed through Maynardville
With G-men on his tail light, roadblocks up ahead
The mountain boy took roads that even angels feared to tread

Blazing right through Knoxville, out on Kingston Pike
Then right outside of Bearden, there they made the fatal strike
He left the road at ninety, that's all there is to say
The devil got the moonshine and the mountain boy that day

There was thunder, thunder over thunder road
Thunder was his engine and white lightning was his load
There was moonshine, moonshine to quench the devil's thirst
The law they swore they'd get him, but the devil got him first

Gasping for air I come up from your lips
Amazed by the beauty at my fingertips
Awed by the softness and warmth of your touch
Bottle, bottle, why do I love you so much?

You give me the strenght to go on day to day
You help keep the mem'ries of a lost love away
She left me crippled but I've found my crutch
Bottle, bottle, why do I love you so much?

Your warmth and your beauty makes me thirsty for more
I can't get enough of what you hold in store
Your amber reflection I see in my glass
My only regret is that you're empty too fast

Fight off the feeling that's always around
Fill me with contentment and hold to my hand
And bottle, bottle, I'll be in your command...

Another day is over
Hard work and play comes to an end
Evening shadows grow long and strong
As the dawn of night begins

Supper's over, prayers are said
The kids are tucked in and that's when
Gentle arms serve me love and peace of mind
It's man and wife time

I lay beside her and I realize
I am such a lucky man
For I've got everything that life
Has to offer in my hands

And I'm happy deep within
As I hold her in my hands
And she knows she's mine and only mine
At man and wife time

God has given me an angel for my very own
And she's brought a bit of heaven to my life
She's filled our home with love
She's taught our children right from wrong
And loved me so completely as my wife

The years go by like hours
And silver creeps into her hair
But the love in her eyes survives
Never dies, it's always there

Reassuring, telling me time has handled
With care what we share
And heaven can't offer more than what I find
At man and wife time

Man and wife time

Where life began when we were young last night
I feel your back pressed close to me
And hear your steady breathing as you sleep

Then as the first soft glow of dawn moves silver grey
Like paint along the wall
I touch your hand and feel your ring
And know this night is all we'll ever have

Suddenly I look into your sleepy eyes
You breathe my name and it just seems to dangle there
Then I feel your fingers running through my mind
Jumbling up my thoughts to leave them tangled there

I know so well, that this is all there is
And when we leave this room it's gone
My mind is clear as we walk down
The crooked little steps to the front door

A ray of sun that ricoches
From off a rooftop light our stumbling way
I touch your hand and feel your ring
And know this night is all we'll ever have

Suddenly I look into your sleepy eyes
You breathe my name and it just seems to dangle there
Then I feel your fingers running through my mind
Jumbling up my thoughts to leave them tangled there

Suddenly I look into your sleepy eyes

Then I'll be gone and you can let some other fool sit down

I'd like for you to listen to
A joke I heard today
From a woman who said she was through
And calmly walked away

I tried to smile and did awhile
But it felt so out of place
Did you ever hear of a clown with teardrops
Streaming down his face

Pop a top again
I think, I'll have another round
Another one my friend
Then I'll be gone and you can let some other fool sit down

All to me is misery
And here I'm wasting time
'Cause a row of fools on a row of stools
Is not what's on my mind

But then you see her leaving me
Is not what I prefer

Or home remembering her

Southern loving, take that southern loving every time

There's a sweet thing in Augusta got the softest lips of all
When she kisses on you you just climb right up the wall
And there's a nurse I know in Memphis got love for a middle name
If she ever gets her hands on you it's shame, shame, shame
Southern loving, take that southern loving every time

Now everybody's heard about that southern hospitality
But that ain't why the sunny south has got a hold on me

There's a teacher down in Dallas I ain't seen in quite some time
Just to think about her burns a hole right through my mind
And there's a gal in Bogalusa just can't love enough
I'll tell you about her with just three words she's tough, tough, tough

'Cause I'm so lonely, since I lost you
Blue boy, I'm known as blue boy
You've found a new boy, and now we're through

Chorus:
I had a twinkle in my eye
When our sweet love was new
Now all I do is moan and cry
And hunger after you

Blue Boy, I'll be a blue boy
Until you need me, as I need you

Chorus:
(I had a twinkle in my eye)
(When our sweet love was new,)
Now all I do is moan and cry
And hunger after you

Blue Boy, I'll be a blue boy
Until you need me, as I need you
(Blue boy)
As I need you

Jim Reeves,Blue Side Of Lonesome,1966-08-08,1966-12-12,"

I'm calling to tell you its over
Yes darling, you're now free to go
You're saying you're sorry you hurt me
But you hurt me much more than you know
You're asking me where this call comes from
Oh, I hope you won't end up here
If your new romance turns out a failure
Here's where you'll find me my dear

Chorus

I'm just on the blue side of lonesome
Right next to the Heartbreak Hotel
In a tavern that's known as Three Teardrops
On a bar stool, not doing so well

The floor has a carpet of sorrows
Yet no one can weep in the aisle
And they say someone broke the bar mirror
With only the ghost of a smile
The hands on the clock never alter
For things never change in this place
There's no present, no past, no future
We're the ones who have lost in loves race

Jim Reeves,Distant Drums,1966-03-28,1966-08-15,"

I hear the sound of distant drums
Far away, far away
And if they call for me to come
Then I must go and you must stay

So Mary marry me, let's not wait
Let's share all the time we can before it's too late
Love me now for now is all the time there may be
If you love me Mary, Mary marry me

I hear the sound of bugles blow
Far away, far away
And if they call, then I must go
Across the sea, so wild and grey

So Mary marry me, let's not wait
For the distant drums might change our wedding date
And love me now, for now is all the time there may be
If you love me Mary, Mary marry me

Jim Reeves,Good Morning Self,1964-01-27,1964-02-03,"

Good morning self, how do you feel this morning
I must admit you don't look so pretty good
What made you say the things you said to your darling last night
I bet you'll change the things you said if you could

Good morning self, how do you feel now that she's gone?
And we just stand here, you and me, all alone
With nothing in this world but lonely, loneliness
Although I cried your eyes are dry good morning Jim

Now don't try to pretend you don't remember
No need to lie about the way you treated her, oh no

Just remember, I was there when it happened
And I heard those things you said, as she left
You're the only one to blame, but we both must share the pain
You know it's true, she said we're through, good morning self...

Jim Reeves,Guilty,1963-07-08,1963-11-04,"

I've been accused, convicted and condemned
The trial's over, and now I face the end
Is this your way of telling me we're through
When all I'm guilty of, is loving you

You were the judge, the jury all in one
You found me guilty and now my term's begun
I must confess, I've never been untrue
And all I'm guilty of, is loving you

Chorus:
Loving you, and now I'm losing you
Losing you, for things I didn't do

Please let your heart, consider an appeal
For now you know, exactly how I feel
Don't punish me for things I didn't do
When all I'm guilty of, is loving you

Yes, all I'm guilty of, is loving you...

Jim Reeves,Gypsy Feet,1971-04-19,1971-06-21,"

Gypsy feet will wander
Gypsy feet will stray
Neither love nor thunder
Can ever make them stay
I can't tame a heart so wild
Like a jungle drum it beats
Were you born a devil's child
With restless gypsy feet

Gypsy feet keep dancin'
To the tune of violins
Just like devil's prancin'
You dance away your sins
If I could tame your restless heart
Would make my life complete
But I can't put an anchor
On those gypsy feet

My picture's in your locket
On that golden chain
Money's in your pocket
And you're gone again
Gypsy lips will promise
Vows they never keep
Hearts like mine are crumbled
Beneath your gypsy feet

Gypsy feet keep dancin'
To the tune of violins
Just like devil's prancin'
You dance away your sins
If I could tame your restless heart
Would make my life complete
But I can't put an anchor
On those gypsy feet

Gypsy feet
Gypsy feet...

Jim Reeves,He'll Have To Go,1959-12-07,1960-07-25,"

Put your sweet lips a little closer to the phone
Lets pretend we're together all alone
I'll tell the man to turn the jukebox way down low
And you can tell your friend there with you he'll have to go

Whisper to me tell me do you love me true
Or is he holding you the way I do
Though love is blind make up your mind I've got to know
Should I hang up or will you tell him he'll have to go

You can't say the words I want to hear
While you're with another man
Do you you want me answer yes or no
Darling I will understand

Put your sweet lips a little closer to the phone
Lets pretend that we're together all alone
I'll tell the man to turn the jukebox way down low
And you can tell your friend there with you
He'll have to go

HOME (Jim Reeves)
Written by Roger Miller

Well, I've been a traveler most of my life
Never took a home, never took a wife
Ran away young and decided to roam
Wanna see my mama and my daddy back home

CHORUS:
Home, where the river runs cold
The water tastes good, the winters ain't cold
Home, where the trees grow tall
The home fires burn, the whippoorwills call

I remember stories that my daddy used to tell
My eyes would get big, and his chest would swell
I could sit for hours and listen with glee
As he'd tell of how he lived when he's a boy like me

REPEAT CHORUS

Well, mama dear, mama do you still love your boy
After all my roamin' can I still bring you joy
Mom sent a letter, got it not long ago
She said ""come home, I'm missin' you so

I guess I'm crazy for loving you
You tell me many ways that I won't do
My heart keeps sayin' that I'm a fool
I guess I'm crazy for loving you

I don't dare let you go it's unfair this I know
I don't care if it's so, it has to be
My heart keeps sayin' that I'm a fool
I guess I'm crazy for loving you

I don't dare let you go it's unfair this I know

Jim Reeves,I Heard A Heart Break Last Night,1967-11-13,1968-02-19,"

I heard the pitter patter
Of a slow winter rain
I heard the lonesome whistle
Of a far away train

As I sat in the silence
Broken only by a train
I heard a heartbreak last night

Oh, how you cried
When we said goodbye
As we stood at
The station in the rain
And a whisper was saying
From a pine tree close by
When we heard
The whistle of your train

I heard the moans of sobbing
Of the wind in the sign
I felt the cold icy finger
Of fear from the spine
For I knew in my heart
You'd never be mine
And I heard a heartbreak last night

For I knew in my heart
You'd never be mine
And I heard a heartbreak last night...

Jim Reeves,I Know One,1960-07-25,1960-11-07,"

When all your loves have ended
When all your friends have flown
Who'll be around to want you
When all your loves have gone

Only a fool would do it
After the way you've done
And how many fools would have you
I know one

This fool keeps wondering why
He fell in love at all
But you might need this fool
Around in case you fall

After the party's over
And you've had your fill of fun
If you need a fool to forgive you
I know one

You never know you might be lonely
When all your loves have missed
It wouldn't hurt to keep
An extra fool on your list

After your heart's been broken
And you need a place to run
If you'll take a fool who loves you
I know one. (yes)

I know one. (umm hum)
I know one...

Jim Reeves,I Missed Me,1960-10-31,1961-04-17,"

Last night was the worst night of my life no doubt
'Cause while I stayed at home someone else took you out
I cried 'cause I love you with all of my might
And I missed me, how I missed me at your house last night

Chorus:
I missed holding hands walking out on your lawn
I missed the sweet kiss that was mine for so long
Were you happy with new arms
Wrapped around you so tight
I missed me, how I missed me at your house last night

--- Instrumental ---

Did the neighbours say they noticed anything strange
Like a different car parked in your drive for a change
Did they watch as he kissed you beneath the porch light
Did they miss me like I missed me at your house last night

Chorus:
I missed holding hands walking out on your lawn
I missed the sweet kiss that was mine for so long
Were you happy with new arms
Wrapped around you so tight
I missed me, how I missed me at your house last night...

Jim Reeves,I Won't Come In While He's There,1967-01-30,1967-05-01,"

Thought I'd stop by awhile and see you
Just once more before I leave town
But his car's parked there in your driveway
And I see the curtain's pulled down

I won't bother to ring your doorbell
I'm not sure just how much I can bear
I might do something I'd be sorry for later
So I won't come in while he's there

Does he know my whole world is in there with him?
That he's king while he sits there in my chair
I'd like to tell you just how much I still love you
But I won't come in while he's there
No, I won't come in while he's there

I'd even like to be the carpet on your floor

I'd like to be the star outside your window
That lucky chair that holds you every night
The coffee pot you warm up every morning

And if you need someone to talk with
I'd like to be the little voice inside
And if you'll ever have a heartache

Don't tell me I'm losing the love that was mine

I filled up my pockets with money
Big trophies I've hung on my wall
My mansion sits high on the hilltop
And the world is impressed by it all

But to me always all this glory is worries
And I've not been successful enough
For while I was thrilling the whole wide world
I was losing your love

I forgot to kiss you
And hold to your charms
Success seems like nothing
To these empty arms

All this time I've been gaining a treasure
That I can even speak partly of
For while I was thrilling the whole wide world
I was losing your love

Slowly losing your love...

Two partners went in search of gold
As friendly as could be
One was young and one was old
And the gay young fool was me

Since neighter one could write his name
We swore upon our souls
To share the wealth and then shook hands
The hands that dug for gold. (oh, partners)

The summer days were gone at last
And winter nights grew cold
The snow had trapped us in the pass
When we finally find the gold

We took our fortune to the shack
To wait the winter through
But the food ran low so I killed my friend
What else was there to do? (oh, partners)

I threw his body just outside
Into the bitter cold
Somehow I had to stay alive
I now had all the gold

But the howling wind just seemed to say
You have killed a man
And you'll never get to spend the gold
With the blood upon your hands. (oh, partners)

The cabin's covered now with snow
And shelves of food are bare
Satan's waitin' for me now
And I'm too cold to care

Is that the devil at the door
Coming for my soul
Or is it just the old man
A looking for his gold? (oh, partners)...

Might as well admit it, you don't really love me
You've been acting funny for so long
It hurts to think that you think you're above me
But it hurts more to admit that I've been wrong

Need a bottle and a table, I can find those
Maybe they will help speed up time's crazy crawl
Might as well go around and join the winos
Ain't it funny how pride goes before a fall?

Yes, pride goes before a fall I've got a feeling
That I'm gonna seek much more than them all
When we first met I lived way above the city
Ain't it funny how pride goes before a fall?

Pour the wine, dim the lights and play the jukebox
Dance with every Sue and Betty that's around
Take her out and try your luck that's what's expected
What's the difference it can't bring your honour down?

You are now a full fledged member of the rat race
Forget everything that's decent, have a ball
What's the difference if you die in this old bad place

But I'd still be alone
'Cause my world simply stands still
When you are gone

When you are gone
My heart knows it well
And it just won't believe
These stories I tell

Just can't get used to
This being alone
And there's nothing to live for
When you are gone

--- Instrumental ---

When you are gone
My heart knows it well
And it just won't believe
All these stories I tell

Just can't get used to
This being alone
And there's nothing to live for
When you are gone...

Jimmie Davis,Where The Old Red River Flows,1962-06-11,1962-08-06,"

[Verse 1]
Well, I'm dreaming about Dixie cotton fields and whippoorwills
Where I spent my happy childhood among the rocks and among the rills
I can see my dear old mommy as around the place she goes
To my home in Louisiana where the old Red River flows

[Chorus]
Hi-lee-oh-layoo you can hear the darkies singing soft and low
And at twilight in the evening so soft and low, so low
On my farm in Louisiana where the old Red River flows

[Verse 2]
Well, the nights are bright on Broadway and the city's bright as day
On the beach at Coney Island where the liquors make you gay
I'm heading south tonight, dear on the IC where she goes
To my home in Louisiana where the old Red River flows

Jimmy Dean,A Thing Called Love,1968-03-11,1968-06-03,"

Six foot six, he stood on the ground
Weighed two hundred and thirty five pounds
But I saw that giant of a man brought down
To his knees by love

He was the kind of man that would gamble on luck
Look you in the eye and never back up
But I saw him a-cryin like a little whipped pup
Because of love

Can't see it with your eyes,hold it in your hand
But like the wind it covers our land
Strong enough to rule the heart of any man
This thing called love

It can lift you up, it can let you down
Take your world, turn it all around
Ever since time nothing's ever been
Found that's stronger than love

Most men are like me they struggle and doubt
Trouble their mind day in and day out
Too busy a livin to worry about a thing called love

But when I see a mother's tenderness as she holds
Her young close to her breast,then I thank God
This worlds been blessed with a thing called love

Jimmy Dean,Big Bad John,1961-10-16,1962-03-12,"

Big John
Big John

Ev'ry mornin' at the mine you could see him arrive
He stood six foot six and weighed two forty five
Kinda broad at the shoulder and narrow at the hip
And everybody knew, ya didn't give no lip to Big John

(Big John, Big John)
Big Bad John
(Big John)

Nobody seemed to know where John called home
He just drifted into town and stayed all alone
He didn't say much, he kinda quiet and shy
And if you spoke at all, he just said, ""Hi"" to Big John

Somebody said he came from New Orleans
Where he got in a fight over a Cajun Queen
And a crashin' blow from a huge right hand
Sent a Louisiana fellow to the Promised Land, Big John

(Big John, Big John)
Big Bad John
(Big John)

Then came the day at the bottom of the mine
When a timber cracked and men started cryin'
Miners were prayin' and hearts beat fast
And everybody thought that they'd breathed their last, 'cept John

Through the dust and the smoke of this man made hell
Walked a giant of a man that the miners knew well
Grabbed a saggin' timber, gave out with a groan
And like a giant Oak tree, he just stood there alone, Big John

(Big John, Big John)
Big Bad John
(Big John)

And with all of his strength he gave a mighty shove
Then a miner yelled out, ""There's a light up above""
And twenty men scrambled from a would-be grave
Now there's only one left down there to save, Big John

With jacks and timbers they started back down
Then came that rumble way down in the ground
And then smoke and gas belched out of that mine
Everybody knew it was the end of the line for Big John

(Big John, Big John)
Big Bad John
(Big John)

Now they never reopened that worthless pit
They just placed a marble stand in front of it
These few words are written on that stand
At the bottom of this mine lies a big, big man, Big John

(Big John, Big John)
Big Bad John
(Big John)

Jimmy Dean,Dear Ivan,1962-01-29,1962-04-02,"

Dear daughter, I tiptoed in your room tonight and I looked down at
You smilin' in your sleep. You were so lovely my heart nearly broke;
And I thought how much like Sleeping Beauty a little girl is. When I
Tuck you in at night I never know how old you'll be when you wake. One
Evening you crawl on your dad's lap and throw your arms around his neck
The next morning you might be much too grown up for that sort of thing

You're so quickly approaching the awkward age, too young to drive the
Car and yet too old to be carried in the house half asleep on daddy's
Shoulder. I have a secret that I've never told you, Sleeping Beauty
You're going on a very exciting trip. You'll travel from yesterday all
The way to tomorrow. It's a rapid journey and you'll travel light
Leaving behind you measles, mumps, freckles, bumps, bubble gum and me

I promise not to feel too hurt when you discover that the world is more
Important than your daddy's lap. Yesterday you were blue jeans and pig tails
The neighborhood's best tree climber. Tomorrow you'll be blue organdy and
Pony tails and you'll view the world from a loftier perch - a pair of high
Heel shoes

Yesterday you could mend a doll's broken leg with a hug; tomorrow you'll
Be able to break a young man's heart with a kiss. Humh! Humh! Yesterday you
Could get lost one aisle away from me at a supermarket now I have to worry
About losing you down another aisle to some strange young man. You see
Just at the point where you're growing pains stop, mine begins. Yesterday
You were kind of a pain in the neck when you were around, tomorrow you'll
Be an ache in my heart when your not

Tomorrow you'll lay aside your jump rope and tie up the telephone lines
And that little boy that used to push you in the mud; well, he'll fight to
Sit out a dance with you. The clock is countin' the minutes for you and the
Sky upstairs is savin' its' brighest stars; - and the sun is waitin' with
Its' shiniest day

Oh I, I can't expect you to live in a doll house forever. Sooner or later
The butterfly sheds it's cocoon and the smallest bird must try its wings
But when you grow up and out of my arms; when you finally get too big for my
Shirts, I'll still recall how you used to scatter dust and dolls and partially
Through every room in the house; but you spread sunshine too. The dust is
Settled, your mom picked up the dolls; but the sunshine will always fill
The corners of our hearts

So, here I am talking in your sleep, because, well if you saw this look on
My face, you'd laugh and if I spoke with this lump in my throat, I'd cry
Yea! honey when I looked at you tonight you were a Sleeping Beauty. So, I
Tiptoed over and I kissed you you didn't wake up, I knew you wouldn't
According to the legend only the handsome young prince can open your eyes
And I'm just the father of the future bride

So you sleep on pretty thing, tomorrow you'll wake and you'll be a young
Lady and you won't even realize that you've changed courses in the middle
Of a dream. But you might notice a little change in me; I'll look a little
Different somehow. A little sadder, a little wiser, but a whole lot richer
Tonight, I kissed a princess and I feel like a king

And all the things in whole the world all that I wish for you
It's just a harvest of sunshine and a sky full of blue

And a great big sky full of blue
A haystack of happiness and buckets of dreams come true
Hey look and see though you may be one of one hundred and two

Well, my pretty baby just left me this mornin'
Said she didn't wanna see me no more
Told me not to call her on the telephone
And never come a-knockin' on her door
Well, I fumed and I fussed, and I might have cried a little
My head went a-spinnin' around
But with a little bit of luck, and my little black book
I'll have another'n before the sun goes down

What my baby didn't know was the same thing happened
Not once, but a half a dozen times
And she didn't realize that with a telephone call
I'd have another fickle chicken on the line
But every time I leave I do my best to play the part
Of the lovesick, heartbroke clown
But with a little bit of luck, and my little black book
I'll have another'n before the sun goes down

Now I haven't got a thing against a pretty little woman
Like her walk and her talk and her smile
I've been likin' pretty girls since I found they wasn't boys
And let me tell ya buddy, that's been quite a while
I like the huggin' and the squeezin' and the kissin' and the teasin'
But don't you let 'em push me around
'Cause with a little bit of luck, and my little black book
I'll have another'n before the sun goes down

Now that little girl's out a-tellin' everybody
How she made a big fool out of me
But while I'm out tonight a-rompin' and a-stompin'
She'll be watchin' Dr. Casey on TV
So girls, let me tell ya, better do a little thinkin'
'Fore you tell your lovin' man to leave town
'Cause with a little bit of luck, and a little black book
He'll get another'n before the sun goes down

'Cause with a little bit of luck, and a little black book
He'll get another'n before the sun goes down

Jimmy Dean,The Cajun Queen,1962-02-05,1962-04-09,"

She kinda breezed into town from New Orleans
And said, ""Boys, I'm Big John's Cajun Queen
Now I didn't come here to argue or waste anybody's time
I just came to get my man from your dirty old mine
'Cause he moves me""

""Now where you give up's where old Queenie's gonna start
'Cause I got a powerful love in my heart
So just show me the hole way down in the ground
And tell the whole wide world Big John's been found
And he's livin'""

So down in the mine without a sign of a light
Old Queenie went a-lookin' for John that night
She found him there at the bottom of the pit
And placed a red hot kiss on those cold blue lips
He started breathin'

She waited a minute and then she kissed him again
And old John got the power of a hundred men
Up he come a-clawin' and a-diggin' like a mole
And said, ""Come on Queenie, we're gonna leave this hole""
They started walkin'

Now a roar from the crowd greeted this fine pair
As they both walked out in that cool night air
And up for silence went Big John's hand
And the Queen said, ""I told you I'd get my man
'Cause he moves me""

You can find them today, they're down in New Orleans
Big Bad John and his Cajun Queen
They're a little bit wrinkled from the strain of time
But their love's just as strong as that night in the mine
A hundred and ten grandchildren

Now the moral of this story
Has a real clear omen
Don't you ever underestimate
The power of a woman

To reach the top

Who really loves me and

They give me tips on the horses to play
And when I got the time to spare I sit and wish that I'd picked a rich millionare
I sing up every day at six bacon and eggs to fix
Four kids from one to four pretty soon there'll be one more
Oh by Syndays I'm mighty glad we send the kids to his Mom and Dad
It's the day that makes me glad I'm queen of the house
Up every day at six bacon and eggs to fix
Four kids from one to four pretty soon there'll be one more
Oh by Syndays I'm mighty glad...

Jody Miller,There's A Party Goin' On,1972-06-26,1972-09-11,"

Somewhere a party's goin' on someone's there that should go home
But he's the life of the party so his friends won't let him go oh no
He's havin' a real good time tellin' jokes and drinkin' wine
And if someone's waitin' for him you'd never know
But at home she's lookin' out the window
Thinkin' about the good times she remembers
Holdin' back the tears and wishin' he was safe at home
Inside her two lovin' arms sure do miss him two lips that long to kiss him
And once more whisper baby I love you
Back at the party he's all smiles and his mind is a million miles
From the woman that keeps on lovin' him more and more
One more dance a little more wine he's not too worried about the time
Cause he knows she'll be waitin' there at the door
But at home she's lookin' out the window
Thinkin' about the good times she remembers
Holdin' back the tears and wishin' he was safe at home
Outside she sees the car lights she hears the door and knows he's alright
And though he's been a million places she never looks for lipstick traces
And in her heart she knows he's wrong but she's so glad to have him home
And once more she whispers as a tear falls down she whispers
Once more she whispers I love you

To know know know him is to love love love him

Why can't he see oh how blind can he be
Someday he'll see that he was meant meant for me
To know know know...

Chorus:
Don't it make you want to go home now
Don't it make you want to go home
All God's children get weary when they roam
Don't it make you want to go home
Don't it make you want to go home

(verse 1):
Oh the whipporwill roosts on the telephone pole
When the Georgia sun goes down
Well it's been a long time but I'm glad to say that I'm
Goin' back down to my home town
Goin' down to the Greyhound station
Gonna buy me a one way fare
Good lord willin' and the creeks don't rise
By tomorrow I'll be right there

(chorus)

(verse 2):
But there's a six-lane highway down by the creek
Where I went skinny dippin' as a child
And a drive-in show where the meadow used to grow
And the strawberries used to grow wild
There's a drag strip down by the riverside
Where my grandma's cow used to graze
Now the grass don't grow and the river don't flow
Like it did in my childhood days

Joe Stampley,If You Touch Me (You've Got To Love Me),1972-06-26,1972-10-02,"

Well she packed my bags, kicked me out
We were having bad times
Looking back I can see it was over nothing
Since then there's been too much red wine
And women messing up my mind
But nothing can compare to my baby's loving

Two o'clock this morning, I made up my mind
I'm gonna go back home to my sweet baby
I looked out the window at the city for the last time
Lord knows this life will drive you crazy

Well, I walked down to the highway, caught a semi and headed home
I Hope she'll take me back oh lord I'm praying
Now I'm standing at the front door, hope I'll find her all alone
Then I heard her sweet voice saying

And she said...
If you touch me...You've got to love me...
And If you love me...You'll have to stay...
With me...Forever, and I'll forgive you...
And love will be like it should be...
So If you touch me...You've got to love me
She said...If you touch me...
You've Got To Love Me...

Almost heaven, West Virginia
Blue Ridge Mountains, Shenandoah River
Life is old there, older than the trees
Younger than the mountains, growing like a breeze

Country roads, take me home
To the place I belong

Miner's lady, stranger to blue water
Dark and dusty, painted on the sky
Misty taste of moonshine, teardrops in my eyes

Country roads, take me home
To the place I belong
West Virginia, mountain mamma
Take me home, country roads

I hear her voice in the morning hour she calls me
The radio reminds me of my home far away
Driving down the road I get a feeling
That I should have been home yesterday, yesterday

Take me home, country roads

Johnny Cash,A Boy Named Sue,1969-07-28,1969-10-20,"

[Verse 1]
My daddy left home when I was three
And he didn't leave much to ma and me
Just this old guitar and an empty bottle of booze
Now, I don't blame him cause he run and hid
But the meanest thing that he ever did
Was before he left, he went and named me ""Sue.""

[Verse 2]
Well, he must o' thought that is quite a joke
And it got a lot of laughs from a' lots of folk
It seems I had to fight my whole life through.
Some gal would giggle and I'd get red
And some guy'd laugh and I'd bust his head
I tell ya, life ain't easy for a boy named ""Sue.""

[Verse 3]
Well, I grew up quick and I grew up mean
My fist got hard and my wits got keen
I'd roam from town to town to hide my shame
But I made a vow to the moon and stars
That I'd search the honky-tonks and bars
And kill that man who gave me that awful name

[Verse 4]
Well, it was Gatlinburg in mid-July
And I just hit town and my throat was dry
I thought I'd stop and have myself a brew
At an old saloon on a street of mud
There at a table, dealing stud
Sat the dirty, mangy dog that named me ""Sue.""

[Verse 5]
Well, I knew that snake was my own sweet dad
From a worn-out picture that my mother'd had
And I knew that scar on his cheek and his evil eye
He was big and bent and gray and old
And I looked at him and my blood ran cold
And I said: ""My name is 'Sue!' How do you do!
Now you're going to die!!""

[Verse 6]
Well, I hit him hard right between the eyes
And he went down, but to my surprise
He come up with a knife and cut off a piece of my ear
But I busted a chair right across his teeth
And we crashed through the wall and into the street
Kicking and a' gouging in the mud and the blood and the beer

[Verse 7]
I tell you, I've fought tougher men
But I really can't remember when
He kicked like a mule and he bit like a crocodile
I heard him laugh and then I heard him cuss
He went for his gun and I pulled mine first
He stood there lookin' at me and I saw him smile

[Verse 8]
And he said: ""Son, this world is rough
And if a man's gonna make it, he's gotta be tough
And I knew I wouldn't be there to help ya along
So I give ya that name and I said goodbye
I knew you'd have to get tough or die
And it's the name that helped to make you strong

[Verse 9]
He said: ""Now you just fought one hell of a fight
And I know you hate me, and you got the right
To kill me now, and I wouldn't blame you if you do
But ya ought to thank me, before I die
For the gravel in ya guts and the spit in ya eye
Because I'm the son-of-a-bitch that named you Sue

[Verse 10]
I got all choked up and I threw down my gun
And I called him my pa, and he called me his son
And I came away with a different point of view
And I think about him, now and then
Every time I try and every time I win
And if I ever have a son, I think I'm gonna name him
Bill or George! Anything but Sue! I still hate that name!

[Verse 1]
Six foot six he stood on the ground
He weighed two hundred and thirty-five pounds
But I saw that giant of a man brought down
To his knees by love
He was the kind of man that would gamble on luck
Look you in the eye and never back up
But I saw him crying like a little whipped pup
Because of love

[Chorus]
You can't see it with your eyes, hold it in your hands
But like the wind it covers our land
Strong enough to rule the heart of any man
This thing called love
It can lift you up never let you down
Take your world and turn it around
Ever since time nothing's ever been found
That's stronger than love

[Verse 2]
Most men are like me, they struggle and doubt
They trouble their minds day in and day out
Too busy with living to worry about
A little word like love
But when I see a mother's tenderness
As she holds her young close to her breast
Then I thank God that the world's been blessed
With a thing called love

[Chorus]
You can't see it with your eyes, hold it in your hands
But like the wind it covers our land
Strong enough to rule the heart of any man
This thing called love
It can lift you up never let you down
Take your world and turn it around
Ever since time nothing's ever been found
That's stronger than love

Lord, she's restless
Like cotton candy clouds that sail the day
Slow an' free
And she possesses
A mind that can't resign itself to stay
For long with me
Thought I've tried and tried to keep her tied and satisfied
Until she really needs me
Yes I do
But when that certain look comes on her face
I can't replace it, and she leaves me
She's a butterfly in mid July
Who just can't wait to try her brand new wings
On brand new things
And she needs no rhyme or reason, when she goes
Her mind is on what lies beyond that wall of blue horizon
I suppose
And heaven knows
She'll go sailing off on any old wind that blows
Yes she will, yes she will
She'll go sailing off on any old wind that blows
I know she needs me
About as much as I need someone else
Which I don't
And if need be
I swear someday I'll up and leave myself
Which I won't
Even if she loved another man, I'd understand it more than I do
Mmm, mmm, mmm
But I know the only reason
That she ever had for leaving, is she wants to

Trying to make a living out of black land dirt
We'd get together in a family circle singing loud

Me and little brother would join right in there
Singing seems to help a troubled soul
One of these days and it won't be long
I'll rejoin them in a song
I'm going to join the family circle at the throne
No, the circle won't be broken
By and by, Lord, by and by

Daddy sang bass
Mama sang tenor
Me and little brother would join right in there
In the sky, Lord, in the sky

Now I remember after work
Mama would call in all of us
You could hear us singing for a country mile
Now little brother has done gone on
But, I'll rejoin him in a song
We'll be together again up yonder in a little while

Mama sang tenor

Seek not your fortune in a dark dreary mine

Till the stream of your blood runs as black as the coal
Where it's dark as a dungeon damp as the dew
Danger is double pleasures are few
Where the rain never falls the sun never shines
It's a dark as a dungeon way down in the mine
Well it's many a man that, that I've seen in my day
Like a fiend with his dope and a drunkard with his wine
A man will have lust for the lure of the mine
And pray when I'm dead and my ages shall roll
That my body would blacken and turn into coal
Then I'll look from the door of my heavenly home
And pity the miner digging my bones
Where it's dark as a dungeon damp as the dew
Danger is double pleasures are few
Where the rain never falls the sun never shines

Where the Willow grew

Sparkled in the Morning Dew
I braided Twigs of Willows
Made a String of Buckeye Beads
But Flesh And Blood need Flesh And Blood
And you're the one I need
Flesh And Blood need Flesh And Blood
And you're the one I need
I leaned against a Bark of Birch
And I breathed the Honey Dew
I saw a North-bound Flock of Geese
Against a Sky of Baby Blue
Beside the Lily Pads
I carved a Whistle from a Reed
Mother Nature's quite a Lady
But you're the one I need
Flesh And Blood need Flesh And Blood
And you're the one I need
A Cardinal sang just for me
And I thanked him for the Song
Then the Sun went slowly down the West
And I had to move along
These were some of the things
On which my Mind and Spirit feed
But Flesh And Blood need Flesh And Blood
And you're the one I need
Flesh And Blood need Flesh And Blood
And you're the one I need
And when this Day was ended
I was still not satisfied
For I knew ev'rything I touched
Would wither and one day die
And Love is all that will remain
And grow from all these Seed;

[Outro]
Mother Nature's quite a Lady
But you're the one I need
Flesh And Blood need Flesh And Blood
And you're the one I need
Flesh And Blood need Flesh And Blood
And you're the one I need

Johnny Cash,Folsom Prison Blues,1968-05-27,1968-09-23,"

[Verse 1]
I hear the train a comin', it's rolling 'round the bend
And I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know when
I'm stuck in Folsom prison, and time keeps draggin' on
But that train keeps a rollin' on down to San Antone

[Verse 2]
When I was just a baby my mama told me, ""Son
Always be a good boy, don't ever play with guns""
But I shot a man in Reno just to watch him die
When I hear that whistle blowing, I hang my head and cry

[Verse 3]
I bet there's rich folks eating in a fancy dining car
They're probably drinkin' coffee and smoking big cigars
Well I know I had it coming, I know I can't be free
But those people keep a-movin'
And that's what tortures me

[Verse 4]
Well if they freed me from this prison
If that railroad train was mine
I bet I'd move it on a little farther down the line
Far from Folsom prison, that's where I want to stay
And I'd let that lonesome whistle blow my blues away

Johnny Cash,"Frankie's Man, Johnny",1959-05-04,1959-07-13,"

[Verse]
Well now, Frankie and Johnny were sweethearts
They were true as a blue, blue sky
He was a long-legged guitar picker with a wicked wandering eye
But he was her man nearly all of the time
Well, Johnny he packed up to leave her, but he promised he'd be back
He said he had a little picking to do a little farther down the track
He said, ""I'm your man, I wouldn't do you wrong""
Well, Frankie curled up on the sofa, thinking about her man
Far away the couples were dancing to the music of his band
He was Frankie's man, he wadn't doing  her wrong
Then, in the front door walked a redhead, Johnny saw her right away
She came down by the bandstand to watch him while he played
He was Frankie's man, but she was far away
He sang every song to the redhead, she smiled back at him
Then he came and sat at her table where the lights were low and dim
What Frankie didn't know wouldn't hurt her none
Then the redhead jumped up and slapped him, she slapped him a time or two
She said, ""I'm Frankie's sister and I was checking up on you
If you're her man you better treat her right""

[Outro]
Well, the moral of this story is be good but carry a stick
Sometimes it looks like a guitar picker just can't tell what to pick
He was Frankie's man and he still ain't done her wrong

Hey, get rhythm when you get the blues
Come on, get rhythm when you get the blues
Get a rock and' roll feeling in your bones
Put taps on your toes and get gone
Get rhythm when you get the blues

[Verse 1]
A Little shoeshine boy he never gets low down
But he's got the dirtiest job in town
Bending low at the peoples feet
On the windy corner of the dirty street
Well, I asked him while he shined my shoes
How'd he keep from getting the blues
He grinned as he raised his little head
Popped a shoeshine rag and then he said

[Chorus 2]
Get rhythm when you get the blues
Come on, get rhythm when you get the blues
A jumpy rhythm makes you feel so fine
It'll shake all your trouble from your worried mind
Get rhythm when you get the blues

Hey, get rhythm when you get the blues
Come on, get rhythm when you get the blues
Get a rock and' roll feeling in your bones
Put taps on your toes and get gone
Get rhythm when you get the blues

[Verse 2]
Well, I sat down to listen to the shoeshine boy
And I thought I was going to jump for joy
Slapped on the shoe polish left and right
He took a shoeshine rag and he held it tight
He stopped once to wipe the sweat away
I said you're a mighty little boy to be-a working that way
He said I like it with a big wide grin
Kept on a popping and he said again

[Chorus 3]
Get rhythm when you get the blues
Come on, get rhythm when you get the blues
It only costs a dime, just a nickel a shoe
Does a million dollars worth of good for you
Get rhythm when you get the blues

To gather flowers constantly

[Verse: Johnny Cash]
We were just a plain ol' hillbilly band
With a plain ol' country style
We never played the kind of songs
That'd drive anybody wild
Played a railroad song with a stomping beat
We played a blues song kinda slow and sweet
But the thing that knocked them off of their feet was
Ooh-wee

[Chorus: Johnny Cash]
When Luther played the boogie-woogie
Luther played the boogie-woogie
Luther played the boogie-woogie
Luther played the boogie-woogie
Luther played the boogie woogie
Luther played the boogie-woogie
Luther played the boogie-woogie
Luther played the boogie
In the strangest kind of way
Play it strange!

Well, we did our best to entertain
Everywhere we'd go
We'd nearly wear our fingers off
To give the folks a show
Played jumping jive to make them get in the groove
We played sad songs, real slow and smooth
But the only thing that'd make them move was
Ooh-wee

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Now, didn't Luther play the boogie strange?

Johnny Cash,Man In Black,1971-03-22,1971-06-14,"

Well, you wonder why I always dress in black
Why you never see bright colors on my back
And why does my appearance seem to have a somber tone
Well, there's a reason for the things that I have on

I wear the black for the poor and the beaten down
Living in the hopeless, hungry side of town
I wear it for the prisoner who has long paid for his crime
But is there because he's a victim of the times

I wear the black for those who've never read
Or listened to the words that Jesus said
About the road to happiness through love and charity
Why, you'd think He's talking straight to you and me

Well, we're doing mighty fine, I do suppose
In our streak of lightning cars and fancy clothes
But just so we're reminded of the ones who are held back
Up front there ought to be a man in black

I wear it for the sick and lonely old
For the reckless ones whose bad trip left them cold
I wear the black in mourning for the lives that could have been

Each week we lose a hundred fine young men
And, I wear it for the thousands who have died
Believing that the Lord was on their side
I wear it for another hundred thousand who have died
Believing that we all were on their side

Well, there's things that never will be right I know
And things need changing everywhere you go
But 'til we start to make a move to make a few things right
You'll never see me wear a suit of white

Ah, I'd love to wear a rainbow every day
And tell the world that everything's okay
But I'll try to carry off a little darkness on my back
Until things are brighter, I'm the Man In Black

Johnny Cash,Mean Eyed Cat,1960-12-26,1960-12-26,"

I gave my woman half my money at the general store
I said, ""Now buy a little groceries and don't spend no more""
But she paid ten dollars for a ten-cent hat
And bought some store-bought cat food for that mean-eyed cat

When I give her ten more dollars for a one-way ticket
She was mad as she could be
Then I bet ten more that if she ever left
She'd come a crawlin' back to me

When I woke up this morning and I turned my head
There wasn't a cotton-picking thing on her side of the bed
I found a little old note, where her head belonged
It said, ""Dear John, honey, baby, I'm long gone""

When I heard a whistle blowing and the big wheels a-turning
I was scared as I could be
I put on my overalls and I headed for town
I'm gonna bring her back with me

I asked the man down at the station if he'd seen her there
I told him all about her pretty eyes and long blonde hair
He spit his tobacco and said, ""I'll be dad blamed""
""I believe I did see her leaving on the east-bound train""

I bought a round-trip ticket on the east-bound train
I was broke as I could be
But when I come back, I got to buy another ticket
Gonna bring her back with me



Well, I got off the train somewhere in Arkansas
And I worked up the guts to call my mother-in-law
She said, ""I'll tell you where she is, if you act right
She's working four-to-twelve at Trucker's World tonight.""

Well, when I walked in she saw me and she took off her apron
And she grabbed her going-home hat
She bought a ticket with her tips. Now we're curled up on the sofa
Me and her and that mean-eyed cat

Johnny Cash,Oney,1972-08-28,1972-11-27,"

[Intro]
I dedicate this song to the working man
For every man that puts in
Eight or ten hard hours a day of work and toil and sweat
Always got somebody looking down his neck
Trying to get more out of him
Than he really ought to have to put in

[Verse]
After twenty-nine long years of working
In this shop with Oney standing over me
Today when that old whistle blows
I'll check in all my gear and I'll retire
The superintendent just dropped by and said
They'd planned my little get together
Then he said I'd never a made it
If old Oney hadn't held me to the fire
I've seen him in my dreams at night
And woke up in the morning feeling tired
And old Oney don't remember, when I came here
How he tried to get me fired
With his folded hands behind him
Every morning Oney waited at the gate
Where he'd rant and rave like I committed murder
Clocking in five minutes late
But today they'll gather 'round me
Like I've seen them do when any man retires
Then old Oney's going to tell me
From now on I'm free to do what I desire
He'll present me with that little old gold watch
They give a man at times like this
But there's one thing he's not counting on
Today's the day I give old Oney his
I've been working, building muscles
Oney's just been standing around a getting soft
And today about four-thirty
I'll make up for every good night's sleep I've lost
When I'm gone I'll be remembered
As the working man who put his point across
With a right hand full of knuckles
Because today I show old Oney who's the boss

Hmmmm! What time is it? Four thirty!
Hey, Oney!
Oney! Ha ha ha ha!

It rained all the way to Cincinnati
With our mattress on top of the car
Us kids were eatin' crackers and baloney
And papa kept on driving never stopped once at a bar
Then mama started talking about Jesus
And how our lives could be from now on
While papa bought a used tire in Columbus
Mama rocked the baby till all her tears were gone

She said your papa is a good man and don't you kids forget it
The whiskey's tryin' to ruin him but I know the Lord won't let it
Then we sang Amazing Grace and Bringing In The Sheaves
Rock of ages rock of ages cleft for me

I remember when papa finally gave up drinking
I think mama was the only one on earth that really thought he could
I remember all the times we'd packed everything we owned
Into some old car and started out for some new town
And through it all mama's faith was the one thing
That was strong enough to finally do the some good

She said your papa is a good man and don't you kids forget it
The whiskey's tryin' to ruin him but I know the Lord won't let it
Then we sang Amazing Grace and Bringing In The Sheaves

Those cotton fields were hot
And that tractor never was my kind of livin'
And when I hit sixteen
I had my size and I hit the road to freedom

And I'm glad I wasn't there to see my Momma
'Cause she must've cried for hours
I still hear her sayin' to me
""Get your guitar and pick the 'Wildwood Flower'""

Now Memphis was big
And it was hard to find a job and so I didn't
And it was easier to go back to the country
And it was more like livin'

Now, I've been down every road
And I've stood on every porch where they were givin'
And if they had a dime on an hour
I would pick the 'Wildwood Flower'

It's hard to turn around
And look back down the roads that I have traveled
'Cause like a never endin' ball of twine
My dreams have come unraveled

Now as evening lays its shawl
Across the shoulders of my life, I find
I couldn't tie my life together
With guitar strings and a poet's heartfelt mind

And I'm glad I wasn't there to see my Momma
'Cause she must've cried for hours
I still hear her saying to me
""Get your guitar and pick the 'Wildwood Flower'""

Play it like this, son

I asked about the bridal suite, I told him I'm the groom
Then I took the elevator to the floor I was assigned

Inside I thought of all the things that started in this room
But I'm alone on our second honeymoon
I hear the happy people laughing in the street below
But the loneliness I feel tonight I hope you never know
The life that was a happy song has ended much too soon
And I'm alone on our second honeymoon
I look around the room and see you standing everywhere
The fragrance of your bridal flowers seems to fill the air
The blushing bride that gave me such a free and eager kiss
Two loving arms around me as you offered wedded bliss

One mornin' at breakfast, I said to my wife
We been everywhere once and some places twice
As I had another helping of country ham
She said ""We ain't never been to Vietnam
""And there's a bunch of our boys over there.""
So we went to the Orient: Saigon

Well we got a big welcome when we drove in
Through the gates of a place that they call Long Vinh
We checked in and everything got kinda quiet
But a soldier boy said: ""Just wait 'til tonight
""Things get noisy. Things start happenin'
""Big bad firecrackers.""

Well that night we did about four shows for the boys
And they were livin' it up with a whole lot of noise
We did our last song for the night
And we crawled into bed for some peace and quiet
But things weren't peaceful. And things weren't quiet
Things were scary

Well for a few minutes June never said one word
And I thought at first that she hadn't heard
Then a shell exploded not two miles away
She sat up in bed and I heard her say: ""What was that?""
I said: ""That was a shell, or a bomb.""
She said: ""I'm scared."" I said ""Me too.""

Well all night long that noise kept on
And the sound would chill you right to the bone
The bullets and the bombs, and the mortar shells
Shook our bed every time one fell
And it never let up; it was gonna get worse
Before it got any better

Well when the sun came up, the noise died down
We got a few minutes sleep, an' we were sleepin' sound
When a soldier knocked on our door and said:
""Last night they brought in seven dead, and 14 wounded.""
And would we come down to the base hospital, and see the boys
""Yes!""

So we went to the hospital ward by day
And every night we were singin' away
Then the shells and the bombs was goin' again
And the helicopters brought in the wounded men
Night after night; day after day
Comin' and a goin'

So we sadly sang for them our last song
And reluctantly we said: ""So long.""
We did our best to let 'em know that we care
For every last one of 'em that's over there
Whether we belong over there or not
Somebody over here love's 'em, and needs 'em

Well now that's about all that there is to tell
About that little trip into livin' hell
And if I ever go back over there any more
I hope there's none of our boys there for me to sing for;
I hope that war is over with
And they all come back home
To stay

In peace

Johnny Cash,Smiling Bill McCall,1960-05-09,1960-06-27,"

[Verse]
Well, the whole town listened to the radio
For the Smiling Bill McCall Show
Everyone in Nashville
Was listening to Bill
I don't want to be laying in bed
When they pronounce me dead
He'd stand and breathe in the microphone
With his guitar hanging to his knee bone
All the girls just sat and dreamed
When Bill began his song
I don't want my hat to be hung
When my last song is sung
But he never let fame go to his head
This is Smiling Bill McCall, he said
Going to pick and sing a song or two
You all listen until I'm through
And if you're at the house or in your car
Tune in this time tomorrow
To all the boys he was a big hero
They'd glue their ears to the radio
Then talking a most unusual drawl
Imitating Bill McCall
Daddy, can I get a guitar
Because I want to be a star
The girls would say of Bill McCall
Why I bet he's over six feet tall
Handsomest man in Nashville
They said of Smiling Bill
He won't be planting potato slips
When he cashes in his chips
Then one day Bill didn't make the show
Didn't even show up for a week or so
The station's boss said to city hall
Find Smiling Bill McCall
It won't be hard to track him down
He's got the biggest feet in town
Well, there's a creek that runs through Nashville
And on the bank they found Smiling Bill
He's committing suicide
But they grabbed him before he tried
Turn me loose, I want to jump, he screamed
Because I can't stand that theme
Let this be my final breath
Because I'm scared to half to death
The big brave Smiling Bill McCall
Is only four feet tall
I'd rather be in the river dead
Than to hear them laughing at my bald head

Johnny Cash,Sunday Morning Coming Down,1970-08-31,1970-12-07,"

Well I woke up Sunday morning
With no way to hold my head, that didn't hurt
And the beer I had for breakfast wasn't bad
So I had one more for dessert
Then I fumbled in my closet through my clothes
And found my cleanest dirty shirt
Then I washed my face and combed my hair
And stumbled down the stairs to meet the day

I'd smoked my mind the night before
With cigarettes and the songs I'd been pickin'
But I lit my first and watched a small kid
Playin' with a can that he was kicking
Then I walked across the street
And caught the Sunday smell of someone's fryin' chicken
And it took me back to somethin'
That I'd lost somewhere, somehow along the way

On a Sunday morning sidewalk
I'm wishing Lord that I was stoned
Cause there's something in a Sunday
That makes a body feel alone
And there's nothin' short of dyin'
That's half as lonesome as the sound
Of a sleepin' city sidewalk
And Sunday mornin' comin' down

In the park I saw a daddy
With a laughin' little girl that he was swingin'
And I stopped beside a Sunday school
And listened to the songs they were singin'
Then I headed down the street
And somewhere far away a lonely bell was ringin'
And it echoed thru the canyon
Like the disappearing dreams of yesterday

On a Sunday morning sidewalk
I'm wishing Lord that I was stoned
Cause there's something in a Sunday
That makes a body feel alone
And there's nothin' short of dyin'
That's half as lonesome as the sound
Of a sleepin' city sidewalk
And Sunday mornin' comin' down

Johnny Cash,Tennessee Flat-Top Box,1961-12-18,1962-03-19,"

[Verse]
In a little cabaret in a South Texas border town
Sat a boy and his guitar
And the people came from miles around
And all the girls from there to Austin
Were slipping away from home and putting jewelery in hock
To take the trip, to go and listen
To the little dark-haired boy
That played the Tennessee flat top box
And he would play

Well, he couldn't ride or wrangle
And he never cared to make a dime
But give him his guitar, and he'd be happy all the time
And all the girls from nine to ninety
Were snapping fingers, tapping toes
And begging him don't stop
And hypnotized and fascinated
By the little dark-haired boy
That played the Tennessee flat top box
And he would play

Then one day he was gone, and no one ever saw him around
He'd vanished like the breeze, they forgot him in the little town
But all the girls still dreamed about him
And hung around the cabaret until the doors were locked
And then one day on the Hit Parade
Was a little dark-haired boy
That played the Tennessee flat top box

[Outro]
And he would play

You're telling everyone in town that I don't treat you right
You even say I stay away and don't come home at night
I'm losing you and you are all I've got thanks a lot thanks a lot
It seems you like to hurt me and you know I'm good to you
I'd give you anything I own do anything you want me to
Yeah now you really got me on the spot thanks a lot thanks a lot
Still I would forgive you if you'd let me I'd be glad if we could try again
But it seems that you're just out to get me
And it looks as if you're just about to win
No matter what you do I'll always do love you
And you will never know how it hurts to see you go
And you're calling me those things you know I'm not thanks a lot thanks a lot

[Intro]
Ira Hayes
Ira Hayes

[Chorus]
Call him drunken Ira Hayes
He won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey drinking Indian
Nor the Marine that went to war

[Verse 1]
Gather round me people there's a story I would tell
About a brave young Indian you should remember well
From the land of the Pima Indian
A proud and noble band
Who farmed the Phoenix valley in Arizona land
Down the ditches for a thousand years
The water grew Ira's peoples' crops
Until the white man stole the water rights
And the sparkling water stopped
Now Ira's folks were hungry
And their land grew crops of weeds
When war came, Ira volunteered
And forgot the white man's greed

[Chorus]
Call him drunken Ira Hayes
He won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey drinking Indian
Nor the Marine that went to war

[Bridge]
There they battled up Iwo Jima's hill
Two hundred and fifty men
But only twenty-seven lived to walk back down again

[Verse 2]
And when the fight was over
And when Old Glory raised
Among the men who held it high
Was the Indian, Ira Hayes

[Chorus]
Call him drunken Ira Hayes
He won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey drinking Indian
Nor the Marine that went to war

[Bridge]
Ira returned a hero
Celebrated through the land
He was wined and speeched and honored
Everybody shook his hand

[Verse 3]
But he was just a Pima Indian
No water, no home, no chance
At home nobody cared what Ira'd done
And when the Indians dance

[Chorus]
Call him drunken Ira Hayes
He won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey drinking Indian
Nor the Marine that went to war

[Verse 4]
Then Ira started drinking hard
Jail was often his home
They'd let him raise the flag and lower it
Like you'd throw a dog a bone!
He died drunk one morning
Alone in the land he fought to save
Two inches of water in a lonely ditch
Was a grave for Ira Hayes

[Chorus]
Call him drunken Ira Hayes
He won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey drinking Indian
Nor the Marine that went to war

[Verse 5]
Yeah, call him drunken Ira Hayes
But his land is just as dry
And his ghost is lying thirsty
In the ditch where Ira died

Johnny Cash,The Big Battle,1962-03-26,1962-04-09,"

[Verse]
I think sir the battle is over, and the young soldier lay down his gun
I'm tired of running for cover, I'm certain the battle is done
For see over there where we fought them, it's quiet for they've all gone away
All left is the dead and the dying, the blue lying long side the grave
So you think the battle is over, and you even lay down your gun
You carelessly rise from your cover, for you think the battle is done
Now boy hit the dirt, listen to me, for I'm still the one in command
Get flat on the ground here beside me, and lay your heart to the sand
Can you hear the deafening rumble, can you feel the trembling ground
It's not just the horses and wagons that make such a deafening sound
For every shot fired had an echo and every man killed wanted life
There lies your friend Jim McKinney, can you take the news to his wife?
No son the battle's not over, the battle has only begun
The rest of the battle will cover the part that has blackened the sun
The fight yet to come is not with cannon, nor will the fight be hand-to-hand
No one will regroup the forces, no charge will a general command
The battle will rage in the bosom of mother and sweetheart and wife
Brother and sister and daughter will grieve for the rest of their lives
Now go ahead, rise from your cover, be thankful that God let you live
Go fight the rest of the battle for those who gave all they could give
I see sir the battle's not over, the battle has only begun
The rest of the battle will cover this part that has blackened the sun
For though there's no sound of the cannon and though there's no smoke in the sky
I'm dropping the gun and the saber and ready for battle am I

She's watching now with her new love I know

Be better than you've ever been before

Johnny Cash,The One On The Right Is On The Left,1966-02-07,1966-06-06,"

There once was a musical troupe
A picking, singing folk group
They sang the mountain ballads
And the folk songs of our land
They were long on musical ability
Folks thought they would go far
But political incompatibility led to their downfall

Well, the one on the right was on the left
And the one in the middle was on the right
And the one on the left was in the middle
And the guy in the rear was a Methodist

This musical aggregation toured the entire nation
Singing the traditional ballads
And the folk songs of our land
They performed with great virtuosity
And soon they were the rage
But political animosity prevailed upon the stage

Well, the one on the right was on the left
And the one in the middle was on the right
And the one on the left was in the middle
And the guy in the rear burned his driver's license

Well the curtain had ascended
A hush fell on the crowd
As thousands there were gathered
To hear the folk songs of our land
But they took their politics seriously
And that night at the concert hall
As the audience watched deliriously
They had a free-for-all

Well, the one on the right was on the bottom
And the one in the middle was on the top
And the one on the left got a broken arm
And the guy in the rear said, ""Oh dear""

Now this should be a lesson if you plan to start a folk group
Don't go mixing politics with the folk songs of our land
Just work on harmony and diction
Play your banjo well
And if you have political convictions
Keep them to yourself

Now, the one on the left works in a bank
And the one in the middle drives a truck
The one on the right's an all-night deejay
And the guy in the rear got drafted

When I grow old if there's no gray from worry in my hair

When the road was long and weary you gave me a few good mile
What do I care if I miss a goal because I make a slip?
I'll still be satisfied because I tasted your sweet lips

What do I care if I never have much money?
And sometimes my table looks a little bare
Anything that I may miss is made up for each time we kiss
You love me and I love you, so what do I care?

Being taught the golden rule
And by the time another year has gone around
It may be his turn to lay his life down
Can you blame the voice of youth for asking

""What is truth?""

A young man sitting on the witness stand
The man with the book says - ""Raise your hand!""
""Repeat after me, I solemnly swear""
The man looked down at his long hair
And although the young man solemnly swore
Nobody seems to hear anymore
And it didn't really matter if the truth was there
It was the cut of his clothes and the length of his hair
And the lonely voice of youth cries

""What is truth?""

The young girl dancing to the latest beat
Has found new ways to move her feet
The young man speaking in the city square
Is trying to tell somebody that he cares
Yeah, the ones that you're calling wild
Are going to be the leaders in a little while
This old world's waking to a new born day
And I solemnly swear that it'll be their way
You better help the voice of youth find

What is truth?

What is truth?

But my search for love was through the day that I found you
Cause you're the nearest thing to heaven yes you are

When the smile was flashed my way and stood before two open arms
But I turned and walked away because I love you like I do

It's just about time I had my sayin' I told you a thing or two
It's just about time I paid you back you treat me like you do

Cause just about then an empty feelin' reminds me I miss you

They're comin' after awhile make me walk that last mile
But I ain't gonna cry I'm gonna smile

Let me walk along that shady river lane
Let me stand once again where she took a hundred men
Where I first felt the squeeze of the chain
Lord where she used to laugh at me when I's in pain
Oh that holy angel in her grin and that big ugly devil neath her skin
She was shy and she was bold sweet and warm I been told
Now her hot body's floatin' in the cold
And her ghost slips among the sugar cane
Last night I dreamed I was there
Looking down at her face pale and fair
With the red eyes and the sun fish
Swimmin' and weavin' all through her long streaming hair
Oh but take me down to the River Bottom boys
Let me loaf around and take me ease
Let me sit on that stump where she took that long jump
With my clothes line tied around her knees Lord
Her cheatin' hands clutching at the breeze
Where she went straight down to her death
With that cussin' and whiskey on her breath
Where them lies of before couldn't help her no more

Her eyes tell the story so well that she tries hard to hide
So little expected too often neglected a woman stripped of her pride
Always so careful not to cry until I fall asleep
Then there in the silence she lies with the tear on her cheek
A thought comes to mind that I read it sometime
I hear it I can't quite recall
That a man without love is only half of a man
But a woman is nothing at all
She knows I don't love her although heaven knows that I've tried
Her reason for living is to go right on giving
Neither one thinks that's she's been denied
Without any warning in the hours of the morning she cries
And the hurt deep inside that she's tried so to hide
Is beginning to show in her eyes
Then a thought comes to mind...
A man without love is only half of a man
But a woman is nothing at all

In May of nineteen forty-one the war had just begun
The Germans had the biggest ship that had the biggest guns
The Bismark was the fastest ship that ever sailed the seas
On her deck were guns as big as steers and shells as big as trees

Out of the cold and foggy night came the British ship the Hood
And evry British seaman, he knew and understood
They had to sink the Bismark, the terror of the sea
Stop those guns as big as steers and those shells as big as trees

We'll find that German battleship thats makin' such a fuss
We gotta sink the Bismark cause the world depends on us
Hit the decks a-runnin' boys and spin those guns around
When we find the Bismark we gotta cut her down

The Hood found the Bismark and on that fatal day
The Bismark started firin' fifteen miles away
We gotta sink the Bismark was the battle sound
But when the smoke had cleared away
The mighty Hood went down

For six long days and weary nights they tried to find her trail
Churchill told the people ""Put ev'ry ship a-sail""
Cause somewhere on that ocean I know she's gotta be
We gotta send the Bismark to the bottom of the sea

We'll find that German battleship that's makin' such a fuss
We gotta sink the Bismark cause the world depends on us
Hit the decks a-runnin' boys and spin those guns around
When we find the Bismark we gotta cut her down

The fog was gone the seventh day and they saw the mornin' sun
Ten hours away from homeland the Bismark made its' run
The admiral of the British fleet said ""Turn those bows around""
We found that German battleship and we're gonna cut her down

The British guns were aimed and the shells were comin' fast
The first shell hit the Bismark, they knew she couldn't last
That mighty German battleship is just a memory
""Sink the Bismark"" was the battle cry that shook the seven seas

We found that German battleship was makin' such a fuss
We had to sink the Bismark cause the world depends on us
We hit the decks a-runnin' and we spun those guns around
Yeah, we found the mighty Bismark and then we cut her down

I mushed from Port Barren through a blizzard of snow
Been out prospecting for two years or so
Pulled into Fairbanks the city was a boon
So I took a little stroll to the Red Dog Saloon
As I walked in the door the music was clear
The prettiest voice I had heard in two years
The song she was singin' made a man's blood run cold
When it's springtime in Alaska it's forty below
(When it's springtime in Alaska it's forty below)

It was red headed Lil who was singin' so sweet
I reached down and took the snowpacks off my feet
I reached for the gal who was singin' the tune
We did the Escimo hop all around the saloon
Where the cariboo crawl and the grizzly bear hug we did our dance on a Kodiac rug
The song she kept singing made a man's blood run cold
When it's springtime in Alaska it's forty below

I'm feeling low but a little more soul than usual
I wanna play that jukebox and hear that song
That tells me how I feel since baby's gone

Jukebox Charlie that's my name
Yes I'm well known throughout the honky tonk crowd
Oh you're right Joe
It's a crying shame
When I start drinking I start thinking
And wear my hurt real proud

One more drink Joe then I gotta go home
I don't know why I'll just sit
And cry the whole night long
But I'll be back again Joe tomorrow night
And we'll hear about baby
Who didn't treat me right

Jukebox Charlie that's my name

From the minute that I saw her
I knew I just had to have her
I asked if I could take her for a spin'

But I heard her engine purrin'
And I saw her tail-light blinkin'
I knew I'd never be the same again

So I drove her 'round the corner
Up the street and down the highway
Showin' off to everybody that I seen

[Chorus]
She's a steamlined
Sleek lookin'
Smooth runnin'
Fast movin'
Thrift-takin'
Lovin' machine

She's a-quick with dual headlights
Padded dash and positive traction
Instant heatin' and a six-way swivel seat

And it's no wonder that the connoisseurs
Of fine machinery
Feel so happy
When I drive her down the street

She's got two of the biggest
And the prettiest and the roundest
Softest bluest eyes
You've ever seen

[repeat Chorus]
If I leave her for a minute
All the hot rods gather 'round her
They just can't believe that such a thing is real

But they've never seen a chassis
Quite as slick and half as classy
They'd give anything
To get behind the wheel

So I keep my little lover
Locked up tight and undercover
Give no one a chance to yell
Mechanic's glee

[repeat Chorus]
She ain't too fast in the take-off
But she's a winner in the long run
And she's ?? ?? when she accelerates

If she shimmies just a little
At high speed; well who's complainin'?
Fact of the matter is I think it's kinda great

With the proper restorations
Safety check and a set of glasses
Soon I'll take her anywhere I choose to be

When you hear this song
Wherever you are think of me
And don't forget to stand up and make a toast to me
Hold your head up high
And love the guy with the big fine car
And don't forget I still love you
Wherever you are

You just wouldn't love me no matter how I tried
And the day you left my world I just up and died
But every night you'll still find me wishing on a star
All because I still love you wherever you are

I've got to explain to the friends we once knew
They've got to get used to seeing me without you
If you all alone I hate to say I told you so
And I hope this song reminds you I still love you so

If he should close you out
Remember my arms are always open
Cause I still love you wherever you are

Though his load was hard to bear

Got the taste of cherry lipstick still a clinging to my mouth
She begged me not to leave her and she cried till I nearly stayed
But I glanced at that old roadmap and she just didn't make the grade
There wasn't nothing wrong with her lovin'
She just ain't got what they got down in Biloxi
I got a doll in Pascadola I got a jewel in Gulf Port
And both of them more warm blooded that any woman I've made up north
And it's a cajun queen in Creole she must be six feet tall
When she starts lovin' now you just gonna climb up the wall
Ain't nothin' against the other states they just ain't got what they got down in Biloxi

When I reach the city limits I'm gonna stop upon the bluff
Nonchalantly get naked and go swimming in the gulf

I'm gonna crawl up on a rock and soak up all that southern sun
The sun shines in Minnesota but it don't shine like it do down in Biloxi

You'd steal anything you can
And everybody laid the blame on Reuben James

Faded shirt, weathered brow, caloused hands upon the plow
Loved you then and I love you now, Reuben James

For a grave, the gossiper of Hadison County died with chid
Although your skin was black
You were the one that didn't turn your back
On the hungry white child with no name, Reuben James

And a bottle in your right hand
You said turn the other cheek
For there's a better world awaiting for the meek
In my mind, these words remain from Reuben James

Came just a preacher, me and the rain
Just to sing one last refrain to Reuben James

Kenny Rogers & The First Edition,"Ruby, Don't Take Your Love To Town",1969-08-11,1969-09-22,"

[Verse 1]
You've painted up your lips and rolled and curled your tinted hair
Ruby are you contemplating going out somewhere
The shadow on the wall tells me the sun is goin' down

[Refrain 1]
Oh Ruby
Don't take your love to town

[Verse 2]
It wasn't me that started that old crazy Asian war
But I was proud to go and do my patriotic chore
And yes, it's true, that I'm not the man I used to be

[Refrain 2]
Oh, Ruby
I still need some company

[Verse 3]
It's hard to love a man whose legs are bent and paralyzed
And the wants and the needs of a woman of your age, Ruby, I realize
But it won't be long, I've heard them say, until I'm not around

[Refrain 1]
Oh Ruby
Don't take your love to town

[Verse 3]
She's leavin' now cause I just heard the slammin' of the door
The way I know I've heard it slam 100 times before
And if I could move I'd get my gun and put her in the ground

[Refrain 1]
Oh Ruby
Don't take your love to town

[Refrain 3]
Oh Ruby
For God sake's turn around

Kitty Wells,A Woman Half My Age,1966-01-31,1966-04-25,"

You say I've lost you to a woman half my age
A lovely young acquantance that you've made
You say your love for me you've laid aside
And she's rekindled flames you thought had died
But if your love affair with her goes wrong and if you miss the love you left at home
Come back and we'll tear out this tarnished page
And we'll forget that woman half my age

The lines that time has etched upon my brows a face grown too familiar to you now
The look that often took the place of words you're replacing now with looks from her
But if your love affair with he...
Yes we'll forget that woman half my age

All the time through
The years, smiles or tears

Tonight they're singing in the villas
Tomorrow you'll be gone so far
Hold me close and say you love me
While Amigo plays his blue guitar

Ay, ay, ay, ay
The moon is lonely
Tomorrow I'll wonder where you are
Ma-na-na morning, my darling
I'll be blue as Amigo's guitar

They've hushed their singing in the villas
All is quiet beneath the stars
Amigo plays Hasta Luego
Upon his lonely blue guitar
Ay, ay, ay, ay
The moon is lonely...

In the mist of all the laughter
Stop and face yourself
See that mirror on the wall
Oh, foolish one
Tell the image in the glasstop
Do you kidding now
With your life of sin and shame
And fickle fun

Fun tonight
But in the morning
You'll hate yourself for all the wrong you've done
Put down that glass bid goodbye
And come on home right now
Don't become a hopeless laid
To fickle fun

Out to parties every night
A new girl by your side
Can't you see your very life has come undone
You're playing songs upon the strings that lead to loneliness
Countless kisses
Happy pleasures
Fickle fun
Fun tonight
But in the morning...

The harbor's empty, my love has gone

I can't tell my heart that
I can't tell my heart, that you are no good

Kitty Wells,I Gave My Wedding Dress Away,1963-08-12,1963-09-16,"

Tomorrow was to be my wedding day, but I gave my wedding dress away
Another will be holding my bouquet, and I gave my wedding dress away
My baby sister wanted him, and so she took my place
It's worth my broken heart to see, the smile upon her face
I've cared for her since Mother went away, so I gave my wedding dress away

(spoken)
Everything I always wanted, she always wanted too, and maybe giving in to her was not the thing to do. She's all I have to live for, she's the only joy I ever had, and though she's hurt me many times, she really isn't bad. I saw the lovelight in her eyes, the day she met my ""Jim"" and then I knew that he belonged to her and she belonged to him

If I could win him back again, our love would be devine, but I would break her heart the way that she broke mine. Another will be holding my bouquet, and I gave my wedding dress away

True love is hard to find
And you never wanted mine

You are driving me crazy with jealousy

Jealousy

I'm taking your ring from my left hand
Since you've made it plain we must part
But I'm placing it on my right hand
To show the world that I once possessed your heart

From left to right means goodbye
Oh what a small ring can do
I'm left with these heartaches but I'll always have
The right kind of love for you

I'll wear it my darling forever
Tho' you did me wrong I'm not ashamed
When asked who's the giver the tears may fall
But proudly I'll tell them your name

From left to right I've made the change
Tho' the diamond still shines just as bright
As the day that you gave it and my love's as strong
Though I'm changing from left to right

But something moist keeps getting in my eyes
He called and said don't wait
He'd be working late
And so another lonely night goes by

Meanwhile down at Joe's
The music's playing
I can almost see him there holding her so tight
Meanwhile here at home
The baby's crying
All in all
It's just another night

Then read a magazine
It's time for bed
He'll soon be slipping in

Tomorrow, he will be sweet and kind to me
He'll love me
Until he works late again
Meanwhile down at Joe's...

I go to see my little girl
Each Sunday afternoon
And how I dread the words I know she'll say
She'll ask me when I'm coming home
I'll answer pretty soon
But I know I'm just her mommy for a day

She's much too young to realize
Why mommy can't come home
And that her daddy wanted things this way
We kiss goodbye
And my heart breaks to walk away alone
To have to be her mommy for a day

I loved her dad with all my heart
They lied and ruined our home
Oh, why did he believe the things they said
I pray in time he'll change his mind
And take me back once more
Then I'll not be her mommy for a day
She's much too young to realize...

To sign my name was all I had to do
He saw the judge now he's seen me, there's only one thing left

Will your lawyer talk to God and plead your case up on high
And defend the way you broke my heart in two?
Man made laws to set you free on Earth, but is God satisfied?
Will your lawyer talk to God for you?

We all face that final judgement, and it's very strict they say
When your time comes, I wonder what you'll do
Will you bow your head in shame, or will you turn your head away?
Or will your lawyer talk to God for you?

There's a boy a little boy
Shooting arrows in the blue
And he's aiming them at someone
But the question is at who
Is it me or is it you
It's hard to tell until you're hit
But you know it when they hit you
Cause they hurt a little bit

Here they come pouring out of the blue
Little arrows for me and for you
You're fall in in love again
Falling in love again

Little arrows in your clothing
Little arrows in your hair
When you're in love you'll find
Those little arrows everywhere
Little arrows that will hit you once
And hit you once again
Little arrows that hit everybody
Every now and then

Oh oh oh the pain

Some folks run and others hide
But there is nothing they can do
And some folks put on armor
But the arrows go straight through
So you see there's no escape
So why not face it and admit
That you love those little arrows
When they hurt a little bit

Here they come pouring out of the blue
Little arrows for me and for you
You're fall in love again
Falling in love again

I was born in Saginaw, Michigan
I grew up in a house on Saginaw bay
My dad was a poor, hard working Saginaw fisherman
Too many times he came home with too little pay
I loved a girl in Saginaw, Michigan
The daughter of a wealthy, wealthy man
But he called me 'that son of a Saginaw fisherman'
And not good enough to claim his daughter's hand
Now I'm up here in Alaska, looking around for gold
Like a crazy fool, I'm digging in this frozen ground so cold
But with each new day, I pray I'll strike it rich and then
I'll go back home and claim my love in Saginaw, Michigan
I wrote my love in Saginaw, Michigan
I said ""Honey, I'm coming home please wait for me
And you can tell your dad, I'm coming back a richer man
I hit the biggest strike in Klondike history""
Her dad met me in Saginaw, Michigan
He gave me a great big party with champagne
Then he said ""Son, you're wise young ambitious man
Will you sell your father-in-law your Klondike claim?""
Now he's up there in Alaska, diggin' in the cold, cold ground
The greedy fool is looking for the gold I never found
It serves him right, and no one here is missing him

We're the happiest man and wife in Saginaw, Michigan

She's gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone
Crying won't bring her back
The more that I cry, the faster that train
Flies farther on down the track

I've lost every right to be happy
When I lost the heaven I found
She warned me she'd leave and she left me
Before my first tear hit the ground

I'd crawl there on my hands and knees
Each tick of the clock's a reminder
She's one second farther from me

Lefty Frizzell,The Long Black Veil,1959-06-08,1959-09-14,"

Ten years ago, on a cold, dark night
There was someone killed 'neath the town hall light
There were few at the scene, but they all agreed
That the slayer who ran looked a lot like me

The judge said, ""Son what is your alibi?
If you were somewhere else, then you won't have to die""
I spoke not a word, though it meant my life
For I had been in the arms of my best friend's wife

She walks these hills in a long black veil
She visits my grave when the night winds wail
Nobody knows, nobody sees
Nobody knows but me

The scaffold was high and eternity nears
She stood in the crowd and shed not a tear
But sometimes at night when the cold wind moans
In a long black veil, she cries over my bones

She walks these hills in a long black veil
She visits my grave when the night winds wail
Nobody knows, nobody sees
Nobody knows but me
Nobody knows but me
Nobody knows but me

I'm A Nut, I'm A Nut
My life don't ever get in a rut
Woot-woot-woot-woot
The head on my shoulders is sorta loose
And I ain't got sense God gave a goose
And I ain't crazy -but- I'm a Nut

Is it wetter under water if you're there when it rains?
Is it shorter to New York than it is by plane?
Bought a new lawnmower cause I had to cut the grass
Got ten dollars off cause I took it in the ass

I'm A Nut, I'm A Nut
My life don't ever get in a rut
Biz-a-bah Biz-a-bow
The head on my shoulders is sorta loose
And I ain't got sense God gave a goose
And I ain't crazy -but- I'm a Nut

I drove my Cadillac to Vegas to satisfy my lust
Wheeling - dealing, left old Vegas on a Grey-Hound bus
I sure didn't set the woods on fire while I was there
But remember only forest fires prevent bears

I'm A Nut, I'm A Nut
My life don't ever get in a rut
Woot-woot-woot-woot
The head on my shoulders is sorta loose
And I ain't got sense God gave a goose
Lord I ain't crazy -but- I'm a Nut

The poverty war will be over when I begin to fight
If it took a dime to go round the worl I couldn't get out of sight
I don't mind to take the girls out if they don't mind to go dutch
Makes me feel like a million dollars, and I bet I ain't worth half the much!

I'm A Nut, I'm A Nut
My life don't ever get in a rut

If I see you tomorrow on some street in town
Pardon me if I don't say hello (hello)
I be long to an other, it wouldn't look so good
To know someone I'm not supposed to know

Just walk on by, wait on the corner
I love you, but we're strangers when we meet
Just walk on by, wait on the corner
I love you, but we're strangers when we meet

In a dimly lit corner in a place outside of town
Tonight we'll try to say goodbye again (goodbye)
But I know it's not over, I'll call tomorrow night
I can't let you go, so why pretend

I don't want your lonely mansion
With a tear in every room
All I want's the love you promised
Beneath the haloed moon
But you think I should be happy
With your money and your name
And hide myself in sorrow
While you play your cheating game

Silver threads and golden needles
Cannot mend this heart of mine
And I dare not drown my sorrow
In the warm glow of your wine
You can't buy my love with money
Cause I never was that kind
Silver threads and golden needles
Cannot mend this heart of mine

Silver threads and golden needles
Cannot mend this heart of mine
And I dare not drown my sorrow
In the warm glow of your wine
You can't buy my love with money
Cause I never was that kind
Silver threads and golden needles
Cannot mend this heart of mine

I just can't get it through my head

Can't make myself believe

Talking to a silent wall

I think I've almost lost my mind

But there's a million
Foolish things I do
It makes me cry but you would laugh
To know I kiss your photograph

Loretta Lynn,Coal Miner's Daughter,1970-11-02,1971-02-01,"

Well I was born the coal miner's daughter
In a cabin, on a hill in Butcher Holler
We were poor but we had love
That's the one thing that daddy made sure of
He shoveled coal to make a poor man's dollar

My daddy worked all night in the Van Lear coal mine
All day long in the field hauling corn
Mommy rocked the babies at night
And read the Bible by the coal oil light
And everything would start all over come break of morn

Daddy loved and raised eight kids on a miner's pay
Mommy scrubbed our clothes on a washboard everyday
Why I've seen her fingers bleed, to complain there was no need
She's smiled in mommy's understanding way

In the summertime we didn't have shoes to wear
But in the wintertime we'd all get a brand new pair
From a mail order catalog, money made from selling a hog
Daddy always managed to get the money somewhere

Yeah, I'm proud to be a coal miner's daughter
I remember well the well where I drew water
The work we done was hard
At night we'd sleep 'cause we were tired
I never thought of ever leaving Butcher Holler
Well a lot of things have changed since the way back then
And it's so good to be back home again
Not much left but the floor nothing lives here anymore
Except the memories of a coal miner's daughter

When he got that call from you
You said you really need him
But you don't need him like I do

Don't misunderstand
I know he's fighting for our land
I really love my country
But I also love my man

He proudly wears the colors
Of the old red, white and blue
While I wear a heartache
Since he left me for you

And I can't believe that this is me

That you've been a loving my man

When he picks up trash
He puts it in a garbage can
And that's what you look like to me
And what I see is a pity
You'd better close your face and stay out of my way
If you don't wanta go to Fist City

If you don't wanna go to Fist City

And that he won't cat around with a kitty

Come on and tell me what you told my friends
If you think you're brave enough
And I'll show you what a real woman is

If you get too cute or witty
You better move your feet if you don't wanna eat

You can't have a male friend when you're a has-been or woman, you're rated X

And if you're rated X you're some kind of goal
Every man might try to make
But I think it's wrong to judge every picture
If a cheap camera makes a mistake
And when your best friend's husband says to you
You've sure started lookin' good
You should've known he would
And he would if he could and he will if you're rated X

Well nobody knows where you're going
But they sure know where you've been
All they're thinking of is your experience of love
Their minds eat up with sin
The women all look at you like you're bad and the men all hope you are

On the hand of a man that stands at six-foot-three

Not old enough to understand the meaning of depression
Just something people talked about a lot
My daddy wasn't one that tried to make no big impressions
Just one heck of a man that worked for what he got

They don't make men like my daddy anymore
Guess they've thrown away the pattern through the years
In a great big land of freedom, at a time we really need 'em
They don't make 'em like my daddy anymore

From the Johnson County Coal Camps to the hills of West Virginia
My daddy worked on timber dark coal mines
Education didn't count so much as what you had born in you
Like the will to live and a dream of better times

Daddy never took a handout, we ate pinto beans a bacon
But he worked to keep the wolf back from the door
And it only proves one thing to me when folks start belly achin'
They don't make 'em like my daddy anymore

Women like you they're a dime a dozen you can buy 'em anywhere
For you to get to him I'd have to move over and I'm gonna stand right here
It'll be over my dead body so get out while you can
Cause you ain't woman enough to take my man

But the game you've named I ain't gonna play

And we'll go for a ride on a star
You wanna give me a lift

You wanna give me a lift

Well, I like my lovin' done country style
And this little girl would walk a country mile
To find her a good ole slow talkin' country boy
I said a country boy

I'm about as old fashioned as I can be
And I hope you're likin' what you see
'Cause if you're lookin' at me
You're lookin' at country

You don't see no city when you look at me
'Cause country's all I am
I love runnin' barefooted through the old cornfields
And I love that country ham

Well, you say I'm made just to fit your plans
But there's a barnyard shovel fit your hands
If your eyes are on me
You're lookin' at country

This here country is a little green
And there's a lotta country that you ain't seen
I'll show you around if you'll show me a weddin' band
I said a weddin' band

When it comes to love, well, I know about that
Country folks all know where it's at
If you're lookin' at me
You're lookin' at country

You've just stepped in from stepping out on me
And break that you've been on another spree

I'll wind up stepping out on you someday

I can't hold your love by force I wouldn't if I could
And I can't bring myself to leave though I know I should

You've just stepped in from stepping out on me

Many nights I've wondered what you'd do
If you caught me a stepping out on you

Well you're leaving me at home to keep the tee pee clean
A-six papooses to break and wean
Well, your Squaw is on the warpath tonight

Well-a that fire water that a you've been drinking
Makes you feel bigger but chief you're shrinking
Since you've been on that love making diet

But I feel the yearn to love you even though I know it's wrong
You'll have to take my hand and lead me slowly through the door
I'll be wrong in what I'm doin' I can't refuse you anymore

Lead me on and take control of how I feel
I can't do this on my own cause it's against my will
I need love warm and tender in a way I've never known

The Mississippi River can't keep us apart
There's too much love in this Mississippi heart
Too much love in this Louisiana heart

See the alligator all a-waitin' nearby
Soon or later, they know I'm gonna try

With a Louisiana woman waitin' on the other side
The Mississippi River don't look so wide

Till I was wrapped in the arms of a Mississippi man

That Mississippi River, Lord, I'm gonna swim

Lorne Greene,Ringo,1964-11-30,1965-02-01,"

He lay face down in the desert sand
Clutching his six-gun in his hand
Shot from behind, I thought he was dead
But under his heart was an ounce of lead
But a spark still burned so I used my flammingo
And late that night I saved the life of Ringo

(Ringo... Ringo...)

I nursed him till the carrot passed
The days went by, he mended fast
Then from dawn till setting sun
He practiced with that deadly gun
An d hour on hour I watched in awe
No human being could match the draw of Ringo

(Ringo... Ringo...)

One day we rode the mountain crest
And I went east and he went west
I took to law and wore a star
While he spread terror near and far
With lead and blood he gained such fame
All throught the West they feared the name of Ringo

(Ringo... Ringo...)

I knew someday I'd face the test
Which one of us would be the best
And sure enough the word came down
That he was holed up in the town
I left the posse out in the street
And I went in alone to meet Ringo

(Ringo... Ringo...)

They said my speed was next to none
But my lightning draw had just begun
When I heard a blast that stung my wrist
The gun went flying from my fist
And I was looking down the bore
Of the deadly .44 of Ringo

(Ringo... Ringo...)

They say that was the only time
That anyone had seen him smile
He slowly lowered his gun and then
He said to me ""We're even, friend""
And so at last I understood
That there was still a spark of good in Ringo

(Ringo... Ringo...)

I blocked the path of his retreat
He turned and stepped into the street
A dozen guns spit fire and lead
A moment later, he lay dead
The town began to shout and cheer
Nowhere was there shed a tear for Ringo

(Ringo... Ringo...)

The story spread throughout the land
That I had beaten Ringo's hand
And it was just the years, they say
That made me put my guns away
But on his grave they can't explain
The tarnished star above the name of Ringo

(Ringo... Ringo...)

Well, it's two a.m. in Nashville
Midnight in L.A
You're asleep and
I'm out on the road

And I know that you can't hear me
But I'm talking anyway
It helps me kill some time
Ease the load

Hon, the man didn't like my song
And he sent me on my way
And I put my bus fare
On that tootie's bar

I'm out on Murfreesboro Road
Hitchhiking to L.A
And the rain's pouring down
On my guitar

Honey, dream, dream me home
Dream me safely to your door
Won't you dream, dream me home
And I swear that I won't
Leave you no more

Well, no one wants to help out
The longhair hippie freak
At two a.m. in Nashville, Tennessee

They threw me out of the truck stop
And I got no place to sleep
If this freedom, Lord
It ain't for me

Hon, I'm hanging up
My Nashville dream
As soon as I get home
And I'll share my songs
With no one else but you

We'll sing em up together
They'll be mine and yours alone
I'll be all the things
You wanted me to

If you'll just
Dream, dream me home
Dream me safely to your door
Honey, dream, dream me home
And I swear that I won't
Leave you no more

Baby, dream, dream me home
Dream, dream me home
I wish you would
Dream, dream me home

Come on, baby
Dream, dream me home

Mac Davis,"Whoever Finds This, I Love You",1970-06-15,1970-06-22,"

On a quiet street in the city a little old man walks along
Shuffling through the Autumn afternoon
And the Autumn leaves reminded him another summer's come and gone
He had a long, lonely night ahead waitin' for June
Then among the leaves near an orphan's home a piece of paper caught his eye
And he stooped to pick it up with trembling hands
And as he read the childish writing, the old man began to cry
'Cause the words burned inside him like a flame

""Whoever finds this, I love you!""
""Whoever finds this, I need you!""
""I ain't even got no one to talk to!""
""So, Whoever finds this, I love you!""

The old man's eyes searched the orphan's home
And cam to rest upon a child with her nose pressed up against the window pane
And the old man knew he'd found a friend, at last
So he waved at her and smiled
And they both knew they'd spend the winter laughing at the rain

(Spoken)
And they did spend the summer laughing at the rain, talking through the fence, exchanging little gifts they'd made for each other. The old man would carve toys for the little girl, and she would draw pictures for him of beautiful ladies surrounded by green trees and sunshine, and they laughed alot. But then on the first day of June, the little girl ran to the fence to show the man a picture she had drawn, BUT HE WASN'T THERE! And somehow, the little girl knew he wasn't coming back. So she went back to her little room, took out a crayola and a piece of paper, and wrote:

""Whoever finds this, I love you!""
""Whoever finds this, I need you!""
""I don't even have no one to talk to.""
""So, whoever finds this, I love you!""

Lord, I miss you
I just can't get it
Through my weary head
You're really gone

I just can't believe it
But all of a sudden
I've got too much pain
For one man alone

The nights drag by
And it gets harder all the time
To go to sleep without
Your soft skin touching mine

And I woke up on your side
Of the bed again this morning
With my old alarm clock

Ringing half past eight
With that old familiar hunger
And my arms wrapped
Round your shadow
I woke up on your side of the bed

Another funky morning
Sunday's dead and Monday's
Dripping down my window pane

I wake up shaking
Staring at the walls and
Listening to the lonesome
Sound of falling rain

I just can't make myself
Believe that you don't care
I keep on dreaming
I'll wake up and you'll be there

And I woke up on your side
Of the bed again this morning
With my old alarm clock

And I woke up on your side
Of the bed again this morning
With my old alarm clock

Lord, I woke up on your side
Of the bed again this morning
With my old alarm clock
Ringing half past eight...

With tender looks that I mistook for love
So take away the flowers that you gave me
And send the kind that you remind me of

Paper roses
Paper roses
Oh, how real
Those roses seem to be
But they're only imitation
Like your imitation love for me

I thought that you would be a perfect lover
You seemed so full of sweetness at the start
But like a big red rose that's made of paper
There isn't any sweetness in your heart

A man and a train, a train and a man
They both tried to run as far and as fast as they can
But a man's not a train and a train's not a man
A man can do things that a train never can

Goin' up a mountain even half way to the top
The minute that a train runs out of steam it's gotta stop
But it's a different story when a man runs out of steam
He still can go a long, long way on nothin' but a dream

Goin' cross the country when a train runs out of track
It has to stop and turn around and then start headin' back
But many miles from nowhere out where all the tracks are gone
A man who's got himself a dream can still keep goin' on

So don't try to stop me
Don't try to stop me 'cause nobody can
I've got a dream, a beautiful dream
And that makes me a man

No don't try to stop me
Don't try to stop me 'cause nobody can
I've got a dream, a beautiful dream and that makes me
Makes me a man...

[Verse 1]
To the town of Agua Fria
Rode a stranger one fine day
Hardly spoke to folks around him
Didn't have too much to say
No one dared to ask his business
No one dared to make a slip
For the stranger there among them
Had a big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip

[Verse 2]
It was early in the morning
When he rode into the town
He came riding from the south side
Slowly looking all around
""He's an outlaw loose and running""
Came the whisper from each lip
""And he's here to do some business
With the big iron on his hip""
Big iron on his hip

[Verse 3]
In this town there lived an outlaw
By the name of Texas Red
Many men had tried to take him
And that many men were dead
He was vicious and a killer
Though a youth of twenty four
And the notches on his pistol
Numbered one and nineteen more
One and nineteen more

[Verse 4]
Now the stranger started talking
Made it plain to folks around
He was an Arizona ranger
Wouldn't be too long in town
He came here to take an outlaw
Back alive, or maybe dead
And he said it didn't matter;
He was after Texas Red
After Texas Red

[Verse 5]
Wasn't long before the story
Was relayed to Texas Red
But the outlaw didn't worry -
Men that tried before were dead
Twenty men had tried to take him
Twenty men had made a slip
Twenty-one would be the ranger
With the big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip

[Verse 6]
The morning passed so quickly;
It was time for them to meet
It was twenty past eleven
When they walked out in the street
Folks were watching from the windows
Everybody held their breath
They knew this handsome ranger
Was about to meet his death
About to meet his death

[Verse 7]
There was forty feet between them
When they stopped to make their play
And the swiftness of the ranger
Is still talked about today
Texas Red had not cleared leather
'Fore a bullet fairly ripped
And the ranger's aim was deadly
With the big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip

[Verse 8]
It was over in a moment
And the folks had gathered round
There before them lay the body
Of the outlaw on the ground
Oh, he might have went on living
But he made one fatal slip
When he tried to match the ranger
With the big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip

From where I stand I can see the canteena she goes to
Where she's not supposed to but goes anyway

Camelia keeps tellin' me that's all her young heart is after
I see it differently, I see her there with a man
Camelia keeps lyin', I see, from where I stand

If there was one ounce of man left in me I'd accuse her
What's left of a man knows for certain if I do I'll lose her
It wouldn't do to let her know I know she's lyin'
Or that I've been spyin', she'd never come back

Start the day with early mornin' sunshine

And it makes the day go better

And last night's memories rush into my head
With her kiss she makes me feel that even
If the sun would go away then
Everything would still be just fine
And it's such a shame that every man can't
Start the day with early mornin' sunshine
But she's mine
She's mine
She's mine
She's mine

Marty Robbins,El Paso,1959-11-09,1960-05-02,"

[Verse 1]
Out in the West Texas town of El Paso
I fell in love with a Mexican girl
Nighttime would find me in Rosa's Cantina
Music would play and Feleena would whirl

[Verse 2]
Blacker than night were the eyes of Feleena
Wicked and evil while casting a spell
My love was deep for this Mexican maiden
I was in love, but in vain, I could tell

[Verse 3]
One night a wild young cowboy came in
Wild as the West Texas wind
Dashing and daring, a drink he was sharing
With wicked Feleena, the girl that I loved

[Verse 4]
So in anger I challenged his right for the love of this maiden
Down went his hand for the gun that he wore
My challenge was answered in less than a heartbeat
The handsome young stranger lay dead on the floor

[Verse 5]
Just for a moment I stood there in silence
Shocked by the foul evil deed I had done
Many thoughts raced through my mind as I stood there
I had but one chance and that was to run

[Verse 6]
Out through the back door of Rosa's I ran
Out where the horses were tied
I caught a good one, it looked like it could run
Up on its back, and away I did ride
Just as fast as I could from
The West Texas town of El Paso
Out to the badlands of New Mexico

[Verse 7]
Back in El Paso my life would be worthless
Everything's gone in life, nothing is left
It's been so long since I've seen the young maiden
My love is stronger than my fear of death

[Verse 8]
I saddled up and away I did go
Riding alone in the dark
Maybe tomorrow a bullet may find me
Tonight nothing's worse than this pain in my heart

[Verse 9]
And at last here I am on the hill overlooking El Paso
I can see Rosa's Cantina below
My love is strong and it pushes me onward
Down off the hill to Feleena I go

[Verse 10]
Off to my right I see five mounted cowboys
Off to my left ride a dozen or more
Shouting and shooting, I can't let them catch me
I have to make it to Rosa's back door

[Verse 11]
Something is dreadfully wrong for I feel
A deep burning pain in my side
Though I am trying to stay in the saddle
I'm getting weary, unable to ride

[Verse 12]
But my love for Feleena is strong and I rise where I've fallen
Though I am weary I can't stop to rest
I see the white puff of smoke from the rifle
I feel the bullet go deep in my chest

[Verse 13]
From out of nowhere Feleena has found me
Kissing my cheek as she kneels by my side
Cradled by two loving arms that I'll die for
One little kiss, and Feleena, goodbye

Marty Robbins,Five Brothers,1960-09-26,1960-10-17,"

Five brothers who left Arkansas
Set out to find the gambler
Who murdered their pa
Five brothers and three in their teens
Gotta find the man
Who killed their pa in New Orleans

They heard of him in Houston
And his trail was leadin' west
He'd left there many months ago
And so they couldn't rest
Five brothers and three in their teens
Gotta find the man
Who killed their pa in New Orleans
New Orleans

The sun was hot as fire
And the nights were cold as steel
Hate was strong and youth was wild
And so they couldn't feel
Five brothers and three in their teens
Gotta find the man
Who killed their pa in New Orleans

His trail led to the Badlands
And the desert promised death
The gambler's odds were different now
He treasured every breath
Five brothers and three in their teens
Close behind the man
Who killed their pa in New Orleans
New Orleans

When first they saw the killer
He was by the waterhole
Five rifles rang out through the night
They killed the gambler cold
Five brothers and three in their teens
Finally got the man
Who killed their pa in New Orleans

The desert is their keeper now
For this a traveler said
That poison lived within the hole
Now six of them are dead
Five brothers and three in their teens
Lay beside the man
Who killed their pa in New Orleans
Lay beside the man
Who killed their pa in New Orleans

When you were only fine you caught a butterfly
You held it for a while it made you smile you caught a butterfly
Finally it flew away you cried and cried that day
To see it fly so high an eagle came and caught the butterfly

So don't fly too high in the sky butterfly
If you fly very high in the sky you'll find the sun may burn your wings
And each song you hear let it go in and out your ear
Don't be fooled by the beautiful songs the nightbirds sing

Your daddy loves you best much more than all the rest
I watched you grow to be a lady then you been my butterfly
Learn to fly butterfly before you fly too high
An eagle waits for watch what you do be careful butterfly

And don't fly too high in the sky butterfly...

Marty Robbins,Gardenias In Her Hair,1967-09-18,1967-12-11,"

One starry night in a little town in old Mexico
I found my love down by the sea where soft trade winds blow
She came in the night with perfume that sweetened the air
And I lost my heart to the girl with gardenias in her hair
I glanced her way she smiled and my heart started to sing
She came into my arms and the night became a sweet magic thing
When I held her close I knew I'd follow her anywhere
And I lost my heart to the girl with gardenias in her hair
We shared through the night our love until the first light of dawn
Then one last kiss and like a whisper on the wind she was gone
I go each night to the places where she once spoke my name
Some call me fool they say I'm chasing only a dream
But I know one day I'll turn and suddenly she'll be there
And I'll spend my life with the girl with gardenias in her hair

Marty Robbins,Girl From Spanish Town,1964-03-02,1964-05-11,"

Past the Gulf Of Mexico is an island where
I lived and loved a long time ago
Disappointed in love I decided to roam
Sad was the day that I sailed far away from my home

Every dream I dream takes me again
To the island down in the Carribean
Back to happiness and my Spanish Town home
To the brown skinned girl that's causin' me
To be filled with grief and misery
If she takes me back I will never more roam

Brown skinned girl from Spanish town lives in my heart
I've tried to forget her but how do I start
Constantly she's on my mind both night and day
I've known only sorrow since I sailed away

Let the tide and trade winds carry me
To the girl I want to marry me
I can't live alone just on mem'ries I've known
I'm just like a bird that dosen't sing
Like a seagull with a broken wing
Take me off of this ship let me go home

Brown skinned girl from Spanish town lives in my heart
I've tried to forget her but how do I start
Constantly she's on my mind both night and day
I've known only sorrow since I sailed away

Just to see you and ask how things have been
I shouldn't stay long, there's someone
Waiting just outside, just outside
But I'm with you again and I can't say goodbye

I can't say goodbye like I did before
I can't go, love, and leave you standin' in the door
I look around me at the world that once was mine

There's bread on our table, and rest in our bed
Plenty of courage to face what's ahead
She gives me contenment when my day is done

Because I know our love could never be

Why pretend that I can't live without you

The story began in Renosa
A village in old Mexico
A girl and a Mexican soldier
Were sweethearts, a long time ago
They made big plans for a wedding
The town of Renosa would go
And there would see Jimmy Martinez
Married to Sarah Sero
Oh-oh-oh

One day there came a message
It said that Jimmy must go
As Jimmy was leavin' Renosa
To fight at the Alamo
He never returned to Renosa
The story's been told and retold
How Jimmy the Mexican soldier
Died at the Alamo
Oh-oh-oh

Jimmy's last letter to Sarah
Began with a message like this
Oh dear one, how sweet is the memory
The memory of our parting kiss
I send my heart in this letter
I pray to the one up above
Oh Sarah, don't ever forget me
Stay just as pure as the dove
Oh-oh-oh

I'm like the dove in your window
It's chosen just one mate for life
And you are the one I have chosen
The one that I want for my wife
He never returned to Renosa
The story's been told and retold
How Jimmy the Mexican soldier
Died at the Alamo
Oh-oh-oh

Sarah refused to believe them
She prayed for Jimmy's return
And there ever night in her window
A small little candle would burn
Years turned her dark hair to silver
She prayed for Jimmy so long
Then one night the village was saddened
The light in her window was gone

[Verse 1]
Way up yonder in the sky
Much higher than an eagle flies
I see a vapor trail that saddens me and tells a tale
A tale that tortures me within
And tells me
Love is in the air again

[Verse 2]
Way up yonder in the heaven
In a 727
In a uniform she wears
That leaves too much of her legs bare
That causes men to stare and stare
I'm helpless
Love is in the air

[Chorus]
I cant make myself belief that her remarks are just made jokingly
I can't 'cause I recall the night we met the way she smiled and she said:
""Coffee, tea or me?""

[Verse 3]
While shes up there on a flight
I cry here in my bed at night
Smoke cigarettes and walk the floor
Drink coffee, then I walk some more
I curse and cry in deep despair
I die each moment
Love is in the air

[Verse 4]
While she's up there on a flight
I cry here in my bed at night
Smoke cigarettes and walk the floor
Drink coffee, then I walk some more
I curse and cry in deep despair
I die each moment

Marty Robbins,Mr. Shorty,1966-12-05,1967-02-13,"

Nobody knew where he came from
They only knew he came in
Slowly he walked to the end of the bar
And he ordered up one slug of gin

Well, I could see that he wasn't a large man
I could tell that he wasn't too tall
I judged him to be 'bout five-foot three
And his voice was a soft Texas drawl

Said he was needin' some wages
'Fore he could ride for the west
Said he could do most all kind of work
Said he could ride with the best

There in his blue eyes was sadness
That comes from the need of a friend
And tho' he tried, he still couldn't hide
The loneliness there, deep within

Said he would work thru the winter
For thirty a month and his board
I started to say where he might land a job
When a fellow came in thru the door

And I could tell he was lookin' for trouble
From the way that he came stompin' in
He told me to leave Shorty there by himself
Come down and wait on a man

The eyes of the little man narrowed
The smile disappeared from his face
Gone was the friendliness that I had seen
And a wild look of hate took its' place

But the big one continued to mock him
And he told me that I'd better go
Find him a couple of glasses of milk
Then maybe Shorty would grow

When the little man spoke, there was stillness
He made sure that everyone heard
Slowly he stepped away from the bar
And I still remember these words

Oh! it's plain that you're lookin' for trouble
Trouble's what I try to shun
If that's what you want, then that's what you'll get
Cause cowboy, we're both packin' guns

His hand was already positioned
Feet wide apart on the floor
I hadn't noticed but there on his hip
Was a short-barreled Bass Forty-Four

It was plain he was ready and waitin'
He leaned a bit forward and said
When you call me Shorty, say Mister, my friend
Maybe you'd rather be dead

In the room was a terrible silence
As the big one stepped out on the floor
All drinkin' stopped and the tick of the clock
Said death would wait ten seconds more

He cursed once or twice in a whisper
And he said with a snarl on his lips
Nobody's Mister to me, little man!
And he grabbed for the gun on his hips

But the little man's hands was like lightning
The Bass Forty-Four was the same
The Forty-Four spoke and it sent lead and smoke
And seventeen inches of flame

For the big one had never cleared leather
Beaten before he could start
A little round hole had appeared on his shirt
The bullet went clear thru his heart

The little man stood there a moment
Then holstered the Bass Forty-Four
It's always this way so I never stay
Slowly he walked out the door

Nobody knew where he came from
They won't forget he came by
They won't forget how a Forty-Four gun
One night made the difference in size

As for me, I'll remember the sadness
Shown in the eyes of the man
If we meet someday, you can bet I would say
That it's me, Mr. Shorty, your friend

Hands, that are strong but wrinkled
Doing work that never gets done
Hair, that's lost some of its beauty
By too many hours in the sun
Eyes, that show some disappointment
And there's been quite a lot in her life
She's the foundation I lean on
My woman, my woman, my wife

Everyday has been uphill
We climb but we can't reach the top
I'm weak and I'm easily discouraged
She just smiles when I want to stop
Lips, that are weary but tender
With love, that strengthens my life
A saint, in a dress made of gingham
My woman, my woman, my wife

Two little babies were born in the spring
But died when the winter was new
I lost control of my mind, and my soul
But my woman's faith carried us through

When she reaches that river
Lord, you know what she's worth
Give her that mansion up yonder
Cause she's been thru hell here on earth
Lord, give her my share of heaven
If I've earned any here in this life
Cause God, I believe she deserves it

My woman, my woman, my wife

Not so long ago, she cared for me
I was young and acted foolishly
Broke her heart, caused us to part
Once upon a time

Unconcerned, I let her slip away
In my sorrow, now I curse the day
I broke her heart, caused us to part
Once upon a time

Once upon a time, I must confess
In my reach was complete happiness
Didn't know that I was really livin'
Once upon a time

Now another kisses her goodnight
She was mine, and would be mine tonight
If I'd only done a little givin'
Once upon a time

Once upon a time
I laughed, the night, she said, This is the end
Made her cry in front of all her friends

Acted smart, and broke her heart
Once upon a time

I remember what I told the crowd
Let her go, I even yelled it loud
I talked a lot, and lost a lot
Once upon a time

Gone forever, never to return
Is the love that once so brightly burned
I remember once upon a time
How much I used to brag

Like so many little grains of sand
I let her slip through my foolish hands
And before I knew it, love had turned
From riches back to rags

Once upon a time she was my love

Marty Robbins,Old Red,1965-11-08,1965-11-08,"

Old Red was one of the orniest yet
I'd seen at the big rodeo
He'd bite you and kick you and stomp out your life
Old Red had never been rode

Meaner than sin, wild as the wind
That blew on the Montana plains
Old Red was one of the last of his breed
And wasn't about to be tamed

From Idaho, a young cowboy came
To ride in the big rodeo
The young cowboy's name was Billy McLean
And Billy had never been thrown

The greatest desire filled young Billy's heart
To ride this old outlaw called Red
He drew him one day and I heard Billy say
""I'll ride him or drop over dead""

Old Red was wicked down there in the shoot
He was kicking and stomping about
Billy climbed into the saddle with ease
And yelled turn him loose let us out

Old Red came out with his head on the ground
His back hooves were touching his nose
Trying to get rid of the man on his back
But the man went wherever he'd go

Billy was raking Old Red with his spurs
From his tail to the tip of his chin
He was doing right well, but Billy could tell
This outlaw would never give in

Old Red was running straight for the fence
Suddenly stopping and then
He reared on his hind legs then fell on his back
Taking poor Billy with him

There was a hush in the crowd and they knew
This would be Billy's last ride
The saddle horn crushed Billy's chest when they fell
And under Old Red Billy died

Old Red lay still, no more would he move
The cowboys that seen it could tell
In trying to throw Billy off his back
Old Red broke his neck when he fell

Out in the west is a place where they rest
This cowboy that never was thrown
And one foot away resting there 'neath the clay
Is the outlaw that never was rode

Mid the rattle of machine guns in the dawn's first golden light
Twenty men lay close to death, nineteen of them held their breath
While one volunteered to save them, volunteered to give his life

Private Wilson White, America is proud tonight
Proud to claim you for their hero, Private White

Nineteen lives he meant to save, not one backward glance he gave
As he yelled, for God and country, through an open field he ran
But the enemy had seen and they understood his scheme
And the fire from their machine guns knocked the rifle from his hands

Private Wilson White, America is proud tonight
Proud to claim you for their hero, Private White

Seven bullets found their mark, seven bullets near the heart
And the force of seven bullets knocked the soldier to the ground
But his promise he must keep, and he staggered to his feet
Ran toward the four machine guns that pinned the soldiers down

Private Wilson White, America is proud tonight
Proud to claim you for their hero, Private White

Bullets flyin' everywhere, smoke and gunfire filled the air
Onward ran the wounded soldier to keep the vow he made
Nearly dead, but deep within, was the strength to pull the pin
As he yelled, I died for freedom, he threw the hand grenade

If the water can't get in

The urge to cheat sometime is strong
But a little bitty voice tells me it's wrong
Sometimes I'm tempted but won't give in
Old mister Devil ain't gonna win
'Cause when I see him walkin' down the avenue
I think of all the things that other folks might do
Then I turn and run, run, run, run
Straight to baby's arms

Marty Robbins,The Best Part Of Living,1972-01-03,1972-04-10,"

When things get rough from day to day for your man
And it's a struggle just to see the long day through
Knowing you will be waiting keeps me going, anticipating
The night with you and the touch of your soft hands

Because the best part of livin' is lovin' you
And it's the drivin' force that keeps me strong in everything I do
And there's nothing more in this whole world
That means as much as your sweet love
'Cause the best part of livin' is lovin' you

Sometimes life's problems seem like mountains I can't climb
But hand in hand our love will always find a way
You're my bridge o'er troubled water you inspire me to try harder
But you're always first, dear, in my heart and mind

Because the best part of livin' is lovin' you
It's the drivin' force that keeps me strong in everything I do
And there's nothing more in this whole world
That means as much as your sweet love
'Cause the best part of livin' is lovin' you

Marty Robbins,The Chair,1971-05-24,1971-08-09,"

All night long , I tried, but couldn't sleep
Tried to be a man, tried not to weep
Now, I hear the turning of the key
Silently, the guard motions to me

Now, I realize the end is near
And I find I can't control my fear
As I pass the guard, I start to cry
And I whisper, "" I don't want to die""

Then, from Death Row comes a whisper
""Charlie, be a man""
Then, I scream, ""Just wait 'til your turn
Then, see if you can""

Down the hall, they push and carry me
Blind with fright and tears won't let me see
Through a door and then, I stop and stare
'Cause I see it, there it is, the chair

Then, they strap me in and turn to leave
And the Prison Chaplain says, ""Believe
Faith in God will cause Him to forgive""
I have faith, but still, I wanna live

Suddenly, I'm paralized
This must be the end
My body jerks and trembles
And they turn it on again

As quickly as it came, the pain is gone
I hear music. Someone sings a song
Suddenly, I seem to float through air
Something's wrong, 'cause I'm still in the chair

In the room, there's hardly any light
And I see the Doctor dressed in white
I hear every word that's plainly said
Did I hear him say, ""This man is dead""

Marty Robbins,The Cowboy In The Continental Suit,1964-06-15,1964-11-02,"

Well, he walks out in the arena
All dressed up to the brim
Said he'd just came down from a place
Called ""Highland Rim""
Well, he said he came to ride the horse
The one they call ""The Brute""
But he didn't look like a cowboy
In his Continental Suit

We snickered at the way he dressed
But he never said a word
He walks on by the rest of us
As if he hadn't heard
A thousand bucks went to the man
Who could ride this wild cayuse
A meaner horse was never born
Than the one they called ""The Brute""

The horse that he was looking for
Was in chute number eight
He walked up very slowly
Put his hand upon the gate
We knew he was a thoroughbred
When he pulled his sack of ""Dukes""
From the inside pocket
Of his Continental Suit

Well, he rolled hisself a ""Corley""
And he lit it standing there
Blew himself a smoke ring
And he watched it disappear
We thought he must be crazy
When he opened up the gate
Standing just inside was
Fifeteen hundred pounds of hate

The Buckskin tried to run him down
But the stranger was too quick
He stepped aside and threw his arms
Around the horse's neck
And pulled himself up on the back
Of the horse they called ""The Brute""
Sit like he was born there
In his Continental Suit

""The Brute's"" hind-end was in the air
His front end on the ground
Kickin' and a-squealin', tryin' to
Shake this stranger down
But the stranger didn't give an inch
He came to ride ""The Brute""
And he came to ride the Buckskin
In a Continental Suit

Well, I turned around to look at Jim
And he was watchin' me
He said, ""I don't believe
The crazy things I think I see
But I think I see the outlaw
The one they call ""The Brute""
Ridden by a cowboy
In a Continental Suit""

""The Brute"" came to a stand-still
Ashamed that he'd been rode
By a city cowboy in
Some Continental clothes
The stranger took his money
And we don't know where he went
We don't know where he came from
And we haven't seen him since

The moral of this story:
Never judge by what they wear
Underneath some ragged clothes
Could be a millionaire
Everybody listen
Don't be fooled by this galoot
This sure-'nough bronc buster
In a Continental Suit

Marty Robbins,The Hanging Tree,1959-03-09,1959-05-04,"

[Verse 1]
I came to town to search for gold
And I brought with me a memory
And I seem to hear the night wind cry

""Go hang your dreams on the hangin' tree
Your dreams of love that could never be
Hang your faded dreams on the hangin' tree!""

(The hangin' tree)

[Verse 2]
I searched for gold and I found my gold
And I found a girl who loved just me
And I wished that I could love her too

But I'd left my heart on the hangin' tree
I'd left my heart with a memory (a memory)
And a faded dream on the hangin' tree

(The hangin' tree)

[Verse 3]
Now there were men who craved my gold
And meant to take (ooh) my gold from me
When a man is gone he needs no gold

So they carried me to the hangin' tree
To join my dreams and a memory (a memory)
Yes, they carried me to the hangin' tree

(The hangin' tree)

[Verse 4]
To really live you must almost die (wop doo-wah)
And it happened just that way with me (wop doo-wah)
They took the gold and set me free

(Ah) And I walked away from the hangin' tree
I walked away from the hangin' tree
(the hangin' tree)
And my own true love, she walked with me!

[Bridge]
That's when I knew that the hangin' tree
Was a tree of life, new life for me
A tree of hope, new hope for me
A tree of love, new love for me
The hangin' tree (the hangin' tree)
The hangin' tree (the hangin' tree)
The hangin' tree! (the hangin' tree)

And I'd be your fool and wait at home alone
You go out and have your fun like you were free
Tonight I'll have some pleasures of my own

We'll find out if two wrongs can make a right
Tonight I'll push my heartaches out of sight
'Cause the shoe goes on the other foot tonight

Each time you walk out the door you walk on me
And leave the door wide open for the blues
You fly away from me like you were free

We stopped to talk things over

You think life with me is like a field of clover

Always be this much a man

Janet, there's not too much chance that we're gonna
Make it through this night together
And the reason I'm believin' is there's
More tham twenty years between our age
Right now skies are bluer, later on
Will come the stormy weather
Life is like a book and let me tell ya, Janet
I've read every page

You find satisfaction and contentment just
Lyin' here bein' my embrace
Let me tell you once again, that you'll wake up
Some mornin' and be lookin' in some old and wrinkled face

But I can't make you understand while you're lyin' here
And cryin' like you're cryin' now
And it's hard to think while kissin' you
For no one else can kiss me like you can
And all the time you're tryin' to reassure me
That my youth ain't dyin' now
That I'll never be too old
That I'll always be this much a man

No more from life than I can give

Tonight I am aching, my body is shaking
Tonight Carmen's coming back home
Tonight there'll be no room for tears in my bedroom
Tonight Carmen's coming back home

Tonight as I stand here I notice my hand here
Is trembling as never before
My feelings I can't hide, resistance has all died
My pride will rush outside
The moment she walks through the door

The lips that have kissed her
That's loved her and missed her
Are lips that have cursed her at night
In anguish and torment, I've cursed as the night went
From darkness till dawn's golden light
I thought of just taking these two hands and breaking
The body I'm waiting to touch
I find while I'm waiting, there's no time for hating
While anticipating, the woman I've wanted so much

I've placed pretty flowers to brighten the hours
I put brand new sheets on the bed
I'm nervous, I'm trembling, recalling remembering
The way that she tosses her head

I've given much thought to the fact that I ought to
Have more control over my life
How can I fight it, how can I deny it
There's no way to hide it
The love that I have for my wife

Drivin' a race car is my way of makin' a livin'
My way of puttin' the bread on the table at home
I'm gettin' back about half as much as I'm givin'
And I couldn't make it without a good woman at home

First Place could be just a dream, but I'm gonna chase it
Finishin' out of the ""Top Ten"" is nothin' but bad
In a ""junker"", won't ever be first, I might as well face it
First Class equipment is somethiing a man's got to have

You might even call me a twentieth century drifter
Thirty-two week-ends, I load up the car and I'm gone
And my woman cries with each ""good-bye"" kiss that I give her
And she prays that come Monday mornin', I'll be driftin' home

Well, my woman sleeps in my arms and I lie here thinkin'
Half awake, half asleep, I run and re-run the race
From Dark until dawn, it goes on, my half-awake dreamin'
And every so often, I dream that I'm takin' First Place

But it's got to be more than a dream - dreamin' won't make it
Aw, dreamin' won't ever put bread on the table at home
And racin' runs deep in my veins. I'll never shake it
I'm tied to it just like I'm tied to that woman at home

We tried to pick the most unlikely places
Where no one's out to know us by our name
And for a while we shared the sweet affection
That makes it worth the sorrow and the shame

A lovin' on back streets and livin' on main
Suffered hell through the daylight for the heaven darkness brings
Two hearts in the shadows tradin' passion for pain
A lovin' on back streets and livin' on main

In the morning when I face the one who owns me
And she confronts me with some things I can't explain
Then once again I hate myself for living
And wonder just how long my mind can stand this strain

A lovin' on back streets and livin' on main
Suffered hell through the daylight for the heaven darkness brings
Two hearts in the shadows tradin' passion for pain

For an answer or excuse of some kind
But the words wouldn't come and my mind was blank slowly my head just sank
When she said honey you know I love you truly but who's Julie
Oh Julie what's this hold you've got on me
On my mind in my dreams you know you shouldn't be there Julie

I'd like to say Julie's just a friend of mine
But I know that would not satisfy your mind
You see Julie gave me something you did not she remembered what you forgot
And honey I'm sorry I have to tell you so cruely
But now you know and don't you ever ask me again who's Julie mhm

Melba Montgomery,No Charge,1974-03-25,1974-05-13,"

My little boy came into the kitchen this evening
While I was fixing supper
And he handed me a piece of paper he'd been writing on
And after wiping my hands on my apron
I read it - and this is what it said

For mowing the yard - five dollars
And for making my own bed this week - one dollar
And for going to the store - fifty cents
An' playing with little brother, while you went shopping
Twenty-five cents
Taking out the trash - one dollar
Getting a good report card - five dollars
And for raking the yard - two dollars
Total owed - fourteen seventy-five

Well, I looked at I'm standing there expectantly
And a thousand memories flashed through my mind
So I picked up the pen, turning the paper over
This is what I wrote:

For nine months I carried you
Growing inside me - no charge
For the nights I've sat up with you
Doctored you, prayed for you - no charge
For the time and the tears
And the cost through the years, there's no charge
When you add it all up
The full cost of my love is no charge

For the nights filled with dread
And the worries ahead - no charge
For advice and the knowledge
And the cost of your college - no charge
For the toys, food and clothes and for wiping your nose
There's NO CHARGE, son
When you add it all up
The full cost of my love, is - charge

Well, when he finished readin'
He had great big old tears in his eyes
And he looked up at me and he said
""Mama, I sure do love you.""
Then he took the pen
And in great big letters
He wrote: ""Paid in full.""

When you add it all up
The cost of real love is - no charge

[Verse 1]
Oh, the love you promised would be mine forever
I would have bet my bottom dollar on
Well, it sure turned out to be a short forever
Just once I turned by back and you were gone

[Chorus]
From now on all my friends are gonna be strangers
I'm all through, ever trusting anyone
The only thing I can count on now is my fingers
I was a fool believing in you and now you are gone

[Verse 2]
It amazes me not knowing any better
Than to think I had a love that would be true
Why I should be taken out and tarred and feathered?
To have let myself be taken in by you

[Chorus]
I'd like to hold my head up and be proud of who i am
But they won't let my secret go untold
I paid the debt i owed them, but they're still not satisfied
Now i'm a branded man out in the cold

[Verse 1]
When they let me out of prison, i held my head up high
Determined i would rise above the shame
But no matter where i travel, the black mark follows me
I'm branded with a number on my name

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
If i live to be a hundred, guess i'll never clear my name
'Cause everybody knows i've been in jail
No matter where i'm living
I've got to tell them where i've been
Or they'll send me back to prison if i fail

[Verse]
Carolyn, let me tell you what I heard about a man today
He didn't come home from work and he went away
Till he came to a city, bright in the night time like day
There they say he met up with some women dressed in yellow and scarlet
Their warm lips like a honeycomb, dripped with honey
And something about the smell of strange perfume
Made him feel warm and not alone

[Chorus][x2]
Yes Carolyn, a man will do that sometimes on his own
And sometimes when he's lonely
I believe a man might do that sometimes out of spite
But Carolyn, a man will do that always
When he's treated bad at home

Merle Haggard,Daddy Frank (The Guitar Man),1971-10-18,1972-01-10,"

[Chorus]
Daddy Frank played the guitar and the french harp
Sister played the ringing tambourine
Mama couldn't hear our pretty music
She read our lips and helped the family sing
That little band was all a part of living
And our only means of living at the time
And it wasn't like no normal family combo
Because Daddy Frank the guitar man was blind

[Verse 1]
Frank and mama counted on each other
Their one and only weakness made them strong
Mama did the driving for the family
And Frank made a living with a song
Home was just a camp along the highway
A pick-up bed was where we bedded down
Don't ever once remember going hungry
But I remember mama cooking on the ground

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Don't remember how they got acquainted
I can't recall just how it came to be
There had to be some special help from someone
And blessed be the one that let it be
Fever caused my mama's loss of hearing
Daddy Frank was born without his sight
And mama needed someone she could lean on
And I believe the guitar man was right

[Chorus]

Merle Haggard,Grandma Harp,1972-03-27,1972-04-17,"

[Chorus]
Grandma's maiden name was Zombelines
There's ninety years to tell about in a few short lines
Born in Newton County down in Arkansas
Then in nineteen-one she married Grandpa
We laid her soul to rest one Sunday morning
And everybody knew she'd done her part
Don't get set to hear no hidden family legend
Just a song about the life of Grandma Harp

[Verse]
Just think about the times that she lived through
And think about the changing world she saw
Now somehow she reared a decent family out of poverty
And for seventy years she loved the same old Grandpa
To me, her passing brought a closing chapter
To a way of life that I love within my heart
I just mean to say I think we owe her something special
If just a song about the life of Grandma Harp

Merle Haggard,Hungry Eyes,1969-02-24,1969-06-09,"

[Verse 1]
A canvas covered cabin in a crowded labor camp
Stand out in this memory I revived
Because my daddy raised a family there, with two hard working hands
And tried to feed my mama's hungry eyes
He dreamed of something better, and my mama's faith was strong
And us kids were just too young to realize
That another class of people put us somewhere just below
One more reason for my mama's hungry eyes

[Chorus]
Mama never had the luxuries she wanted
But it wasn't cause my daddy didn't try
She only wanted things she really needed
One more reason for my mama's hungry eyes

[Verse 2]
I remember daddy praying for a better way of life
But I don't recall a change of any size
Just a little loss of courage, as their age began to show
And more sadness in my mama's hungry eyes

[Chorus]
Mama never had the luxuries she wanted
But it wasn't cause my daddy didn't try
She only wanted things she really needed
One more reason for my mama's hungry eyes
Oh, I still recall my mama's hungry eyes

Merle Haggard,I Take A Lot Of Pride In What I Am,1968-11-04,1969-02-17,"

[Verse]
Things I learned in a hobo jungle
Were things they never taught me in a classroom
Like where to find a handout
While thumbing through Chicago in the afternoon
Hey, I'm not bragging or complaining
Just talking to myself man to man
This old mental fat I'm chewing didn't take a lot of doing
But I take a lot of pride in what I am
I guess I grew up a loner
I don't remember ever having any folks around
But I keep thumbing through the phone books
And looking for my daddy's name in every town
And I meet lots of friendly people
That I always end up leaving on the lam
Where I've been or where I'm going
Didn't take a lot of knowing
But I take a lot of pride in what I am
I never travel in a hurry
Because I got nobody waiting for me anywhere
Home is anywhere I'm living
If it's sleeping on some vacant bench in City Square
Or if I'm working on some road gang
Or just living off the fat of our great land
I never been nobody's idol, But at least I got a title
And I take a lot of pride in what I am
I never been nobody's idol, But at least I got a title
And I take a lot of pride in what I am
I take a lot of pride in what I am [x2]

Once i lived the life of wine and roses
And i drank a lot back then for one concern
Success for me lay just around the corner
I thought my social friends would help me make the turn

[Chorus]
But now i'm paying for the days of wine and roses
A victim of the drunken life i chose
Now all my social friends look down their noses
'Cause i kept the wine and threw away the rose

[Verse 2]
I stood by and watched the bottle take control of me
The turn i made was not the one i'd planned
And i watched my social standings slip away from me
While i watched the bottle slowly take command

[Chorus]
And now i'm paying for the days of wine and roses
A victim of the drunken life i chose
Now all my social friends look down their noses
'Cause i kept the wine and threw away the rose

There's not much a man can do inside a prisoner
Just take his memory trips and fights the pain
And a word from home can mean so much to a prisoner
It's been years since that last letter came

[Chorus]
Not a day goes by that I don't think of mama
And my nights are filled with thoughts of sweet Marie
And old friends I ran around with keep on running through my mind
But I just wonder if they ever think of me

[Verse 2]
I wonder if they know that I'm still living
And still proud to be a part of Uncle Sam
I wonder if they think I died of hunger
In this rotten prison camp in Viet Nam

Not a day goes by that I don't think of mama
And my nights are filled with thoughts of sweet Marie
And I remember daddy saying you'll come back a better man
And I just wonder if they ever think of me

If we make it through December
Everything's going to be all right I know
It's the coldest time of winter
And I shiver when I see the falling snow
If we make it through December
Got plans to be in a warmer town come summer time
Maybe even California
If we make it through December we'll be fine

Got laid off down at the factory
And their timing is not the greatest in the world
Heaven knows I been working hard

And my little girl don't understand
Why daddy can't afford no Christmas gift

Just between the two of us we know our love is gone

People think it's wonderful our love can be so true
You never say an angry word no matter what I do
And you have so much faith in me you trust me anywhere
But the reason if they only knew is that we just don't care

Just between the two of us let's give up this fantasy
For we no longer care enough to even disagree
Everybody envies us and the way we get along
But just between the two of us we know our love is gone

--- Instrumental ---

Wish we could go back again to days that used to be
We fought a lot but even then I knew you cared for me
Now we get along so well no teardrops ever fall
But there's no love no anything there's nothing left at all

Just between the two of us let's give up this fantasy
For we no longer care enough to even disagree
Everybody envies us and the way we get along
But just between the two of us we know our love is gone...

[Verse 1]
The first thing I remember knowing
Was a lonesome whistle blowing
And a young'un's dream of growing up to ride
On a freight train leaving town
Not knowing where I'm bound
And no one could change my mind but mama tried
One and only rebel child
From a family meek and mild
My mama seemed to know what lay in store
Despite all my Sunday learning
Towards the bad I kept on turning
'Til mama couldn't hold me anymore

And I turned twenty-one in prison doing life without parole
No one could steer me right but mama tried, mama tried
Mama tried to raise me better, but her pleading I denied
That leaves only me to blame 'cause mama tried

Dear old daddy, rest his soul
Left my mom a heavy load
She tried so very hard to fill his shoes
Working hours without rest
Wanted me to have the best
She tried to raise me right but I refused

And I turned twenty-one in prison doing life without parole
No one could steer me right but mama tried, mama tried
Mama tried to raise me better, but her pleading I denied

There's a certain hill outside of town called Sam Hill
And a certain guy used to go there every day
They said a certain girl lived up in Sam Hill
Aw, a pretty girl, not hep to city ways
This certain guy would come down the hill a smiling
Headed back to town at the crack of dawn
And he had them all a wonderin' what he was doing
Yeah, wondering what in Sam Hill's going on
We knew this certain guy was not a gold miner
Cause he never took a shovel or a pick
He only took a little box of candy
And disappeared in Sam Hill mighty quick
We tried to follow him to his destination
But he had a secret path and soon he was gone
And he had us all a wonderin' what he was doing
Yeah, wondering what in Sam Hill's going on
I know that you have wondered too about Sam Hill
You've probably asked ""What in Sam Hill's going on?
All I can say in answer to your question
Is the goin's on are still going on
This certain guy's still taking up his candy
He's 99 and all his youth is gone
But he climbs that hill and still comes down a smiling
And we're wondering what in Sam Hill's going on

While mama used to pray my crops would fail

Of having one I love to come along

[Verse]
Bonnie was a waitress in a small cafe
Clyde Barrow was the rounder that took her away
They both robbed and killed until both of them died
So goes the Legend of Bonnie and Clyde
The poems that she wrote of the life that they led
Told of the lawmen left dying or dead
Some say that Clyde made her life a shame
But the legend made Bonnie the head of the game
The rampage grew wilder with each passing day
The odds growing smaller with each get-a-way
With the end growing closer the harder they fought
With blood on their hands they were bound to get caught
They drove back from town on one bright summer day
When a man they befriended stepped out in the way
With no thought of dying they pulled to the side
But death lay there waiting for Bonnie and Clyde
Two years or running was ended that day
For robbing and killing they both had to pay
But we'll always remember how they lived and died
So goes the legend of Bonnie and Clyde

Merle Haggard And The Strangers,"Jesus, Take A Hold",1970-06-15,1970-09-07,"

[Verse 1]
Like the ancient Roman Empire this world is doomed to fall
And it's much too big a thing for mortal man
Just take a look around and see the writing on the wall
Somehow we've got to find a helping hand

[Chorus]
This world has never been in the awful shape it's in
And people scorn the things our leaders do
It's time a prayer was spoken from the hearts of every man
Jesus take a hold and lead us through

[Verse 2]
The mighty roar of gunfire is now a local sound
And our city streets are filled with angry men
Law's now a mockery throughout our troubled land
And destruction seems to be the current trend

[Chorus]
This world has never been in the awful shape it's in
And our leaders seem in doubt what to do
It's time a prayer was spoken from the hearts of every man
Jesus take a hold and lead us through [x2]

Merle Haggard And The Strangers,Okie From Muskogee,1969-10-06,1970-01-19,"

[Verse 1]
We don't smoke marijuana in Muskogee
We don't take no trips on LSD;
We don't burn no draft cards down on Main Street
But, We love living right, and being free
We don't make a party out of loving
But we like holding hands and pitching woo;
We don't let our hair grow long and shaggy
Like the hippies out in San Francisco do

[Chorus]
And I'm proud to be an Okie from Muskogee
A place where even squares can have a ball;
We still wave Old Glory down at the courthouse
White lightning's still the biggest thrill of all

[Verse 2]
Leather boots are still in style for manly footwear
Beads and Roman sandals won't be seen;
A football's still the roughest thing on campus
And the kids here still respect the college dean

[Chorus]
And I'm proud to be an Okie from Muskogee
A place where even squares can have a ball;
We still wave Old Glory down at the courthouse
White lightning's still the biggest thrill of all
And white lightning's still the biggest thrill of all
(In Muskogee Oklahoma USA)

Merle Haggard And The Strangers,Soldier's Last Letter,1971-02-15,1971-05-10,"

[Verse]
I'm writing this down in a trench mon
Don't scold if it isn't so neat
The way that you did, when I was a kid
When I'd come home with mud on my feet
The captain just gave us our orders
And mom we must carry them through
I'll finish this letter the first chance I get
But for now I'll just say I love you
Then the mothers old hands began to tremble
And she fought back the tears in her eyes
But they came unashamed,for there was no blame
And she knew that her soldier had died
Then the mother knelt down by her bedside
And she prayed Lord above hear my plea
Please protect all the boys who are fighting tonight

[Verse 1]
I hear people talking bad
About the way we have to live here in this country
Harping on the wars we fight
And griping 'bout the way things oughta be
And I don't mind 'em switching sides
And standing up for things they believe in
When they're running down my country, man
They're walking on the fighting side of me

[Chorus]
Yeah, walking on the fighting side of me
Running down the way of life
Our fighting men have fought and died to keep
If you don't love it, leave it
Let this song I'm singing be a warning
If you're running down my country, man
You're walking on the fighting side of me

[Verse 2]
I read about some squirrely guy
Who claims, he just don't believe in fighting
An' I wonder just how long
The rest of us can count on being free
They love our milk and honey
But they preach about some other way of living
When they're running down my country, hoss
They're walking on the fighting side of me

[Chorus]
Yeah, walking on the fighting side of me
Running down the way of life
Our fighting men have fought and died to keep
If you don't love it, leave it
Let this song I'm singing be a warning
If you're running down my country, man
You're walking on the fighting side of me
Yeah, walking on the fighting side of me
Running down the way of life

Today the midnight oil's all over someone
And those forbidden places aren't forbidden anymore
If my back door could talk, it would tell me
That my borrowed angel's been this far before

I just threw my last bottle at the jukebox
When I heard that woman singing, ""Darling, let's go all the way""
And I just found out my woman is the devil
I just started hatin' cheatin' songs today

Did she sleep in your arms last night, mister?
Were you the one who gladly helped her make it through the night?
Did she whisper, ""it's not love but it's not bad?""
Did she forget to wake you up to say goodbye?

I just threw my last bottle at the jukebox
When I heard that woman singing, ""Darling, let's go all the way""

Yet I look for the light
Through the pouring rain

And free my soul
I wanna get lost in your rock and roll
And drift away

And drift away

Oh, give me the beat, boys
And free my soul
I wanna get lost in your rock and roll

You know a melody can move me
And when I'm feeling blue
The guitar's coming through to soothe me

Thanks for the joy
That you've given me
I want you to know
I believe in your song

And rhythm and rhyme
And harmony
You've helped me along
Making me strong

Had to prove who could run the fastest to win Miss Lucy's hand

But Shorty must've had somethin' boys that can't be found in books
Well cut across Shorty Shorty cut across that's what Miss Lucy said
Cut across Shorty Shorty cut across it's you I want to wed

Now Dan with his long legs flyin' left Shorty far behind
But Shorty could hear him holler Miss Lucy you'll still be mine
But Shorty wasn't bit worried with a smile upon his face
He knew that he was gonna win cause Miss Lucy had fixed the race
Well cut across Shorty...

Now Dan had been a training mhm weeks before the race
And he was sure that little Shorty would end up in second place
But just like that old story about the turtle and the hare
When Dan acrossed the finish line he found Shorty waitin' there

Nat Stuckey,Don't Pay The Ransom,1972-09-04,1972-11-06,"

Last night I stopped off for a beer on my way home
And I saw this broken hearted sweet thing cryin' all alone
My tender heart was deeply touched at the sight of a woman's tears
So I said hi there and I pulled up a chair and ordered us a couple of beers
We must have drunk a gallon of brew when I looked at my watch it was half past two
And I suddenly realized I hadn't even called my wife
And knowin' what would happen to me when I get home
I nearly broke my neck gettin' to the phone
And here's what I told her in an effort to save my life
Don't pay the ransom honey I've escaped
Considering what I've been through I'm in good shape
Well my wrist and ankles are a little sore from the tape
But don't pay the ransom honey I've escaped

Now if you got tied up somewhere tonight on your way home
In a poker game or with a pretty dame and it slips your mind to phone
Don't blow your cool like a crazy fool and tell your woman where you've been
Your situation requires imagination and I've got a suggestion my friend
Tell her now don't pay the ransom ...
No don't pay the ransom honey I've escaped

She's an angel and she could fill any man's dream
I do nothing to deserve her yet she treats me like a king
She worships me all she wants is my love too
But there's just no love to give her I used it all on you

When she turns to me it breaks what's left of my heart
She's do anything if I'd love her but there's nowhere for her to start
She holds me just the way I wanted you to
But there's just no love to give her I used it all on you

Each time I try to love her I feel so ashamed
Cause there's no love only kindness and that's just not the same
I've even learned to hate you but what good did it do
For there's still no love to give her I used it all on you
There's just no love to give her I used it all on you

They even had a bunch of pictures of me on a dance hall floor
Then it went on to say if I didn't act right they could dig up a little bit more

Wither a man that's thirty two

Your head is aching and your hands just won't stop shaking
And you know you've done your baby wrong
I'm a gonna help and get you over this one
But you'll have to make the next one on your own

You better get up, drink a cup
Sober up and stay home
Tell me how can a whiskey only six years old
Wither a man that's thirty two

Olivia Newton-John,If You Love Me (let Me Know),1974-04-29,1974-05-13,"

You came when I was happy in your sunshine
I grew to love you more each passing day
Before too long I built my world around you
And I prayed you'd love enough of me to stay

If you love me let me know
If you don't then let me go
I can't take another minute
Of a day without you in it
If you love me let it be
If you don't then set me free
Take the chains away
That keep me loving you

The arms that open wide to hold me closer
The hands that run their fingers through my hair
The smile that says ""hello, it's good to see you""
Anytime I turn around to find you there

It's this and so much more that make me love you
What else can I do to make you see
You know you have whatever is mine to give you
But a love affair for one can never be

If you love me let me know
If you don't then let me go
I can't take another minute
Of a day without you in it
If you love me let it be
If you don't then set me free
Take the chains away
That keep me loving you
Take the chains away
That keep me loving you
Loving you

Wherever you go
Wherever you may wander in your life
Surely you know
I always wanna be there
Holding you hand
And standing by to catch you when you fall
Seeing you through
In everything you do

Let me be there in your morning
Let me be there in your night
Let me change whatever's wrong and make it right
Let me take you through that wonderland
That only two can share
All I ask you is let me be there
Oh, let me be there

Watching you grow
And going through the changes in your life
That's how I know
I always wanna be there
Whenever you feel you need a friend to lean on, here I am
Whenever you call, you know I'll be there

Let me be there in your morning
Let me be there in your night
Let me change whatever's wrong and make it right
Let me take you through that wonderland
That only two can share
All I ask you is let me be there

Used to hold and kiss me until dawn
Then one day I woke, and he was gone
Now there's no more baby, baby, all night long

Kissed my tears away when things went wrong
Oh, what I'd give, if he'd just come on back home
And call me baby, baby, all night long

Still hear baby, baby
Still hear baby, baby, all night long

Nothing here you'd ever want to see again

And your footsteps sounded like a marching band
And I haven't slept in so long I can't remember
So won't you be a little quieter if you can

Well you're back again tonight out in the kitchen
I can hear you as you rattle the pots and pans
Oh what I'd give to see you when you visit me
Cause these lonely walls're driving me insane
When you're finished with your bath please close the closet

The mixture of the blood that flowed through his veins
It killed his conscience and filled him with shame
He was part white part black part red
That's how he'd got the name George Lorey Chickashea
He had no respect or feeling for anyone including himself
He resented every man in his soul there was no salvation
And he hated the sight of cotton fields and his thoughts of planned nations
The bitterness set his soul afire when he'd think of Indians and reservations
He had the coldest grey eyes I've ever saw on a man
He could look clear through you and back again
And they'd look like the pieces of stone when he'd stare
There was a mixture in the texture of his hair
That hung low around his chinbones never high above his chin
I saw him kill a man with his own bare hands never showin' no mercy on him
He carried a pistol and a switchblade and a tomahawk with him night and day
The meanest man that ever lived George Lorey Chickashea
Yeah he had the quickness of lightning and could run like an antilope
He feared no man no gun or rope
I saw him watch a rattlesnake bite him on the leg he never batted an eye
Then he said get a taste of that blood crawl out there and die
They locked him in the security cell in Baton Rouge he stayed in one day
Iron bars couldn't hold George Lorey Chickashea
At last he gave himself up and said he was tired of runnin' away
So they spread the news that day they'd hang George Lorey Chickashea
He walked up the thirteen steps to the trapdoor
And stood on it with no expression in his eyes
And when the minister asked him if he wanted to pray
He looked toward the skies and said
God inside my veins flows blood of red all mixed with black and white
I have no race or creed I pray to die George Lorey Chickashea

And there to meet me is my mama and papa
And down the road I look and there runs Mary hair of gold and lips like cherries
It's good to touch the green green grass of home
Yes they'll all come to meet me arms areached smiling sweetly
It's so good to touch the green green grass of home
The old house is still standing though the paint is cracked and dry
And there's that old oak tree that I used to play on
Down the lane I walk with my sweet Mary hair of gold and lips like cherries
It's good to touch the green green grass of home
Then I awake and look around me at these four grey walls that surround me
And I realize that I was only dreaming
For there's a guard and there's that sad old padre arm in arm we'll walk at daybreak
And again I'll touch the green green grass of home
They'll all come to see me in the shade of that old oak tree
As they lay me neath the green green grass of home

I just came to smell the flowers here in someone's darkest hour
I don't even know the one they've laid to rest
But anyplace there's a crowd and anywhere they're cryin' loud
Just seems to be the place I love the best

Surrounded by the blues in a place that losers use
Where one smile cost at least a million tears
Look in for my past in the bottom of a glass
The only place I've looked for many years
Now the ground don't seem so very low when you're down about as far as you can go
And it's pretty hard to smile while the whole world laugh in your face
And with no will left to live the world moves fast while you lie still
Too weak to stand and just not enough man to join the race
So I just came to smell the flowers...

The past ten years just flashed before my eyes I remember the day my daddy died
He left mom four boys and three-year old Ginny Lou
She got sick and we almost lost her too
Times were rough even when dad was here but things got worse year after year
Six years ago mom married again and that's when our troubles really began
Jim Johnson was the name of our step-pa he was the meanest man I'd ever saw
He mistreated mom and all of us kids and I swore some day he'd pay each time he did
Never had enough clothes for school but we'd go we'd go home early because of snow
And almost freeze to death fore we got there
Jim bought booze instead of shoes for us to wear
One summer we found six kittens with our old cat
Jim made us put 'em all in a gunny sack
And throw 'em in the river with rocks inside
Jim just stood there and laughed while we all cried
Jim started watchin' Ginny Lou when she just turned thirteen
Then late one night I heard Ginny scream
I run and got the shotgun and grabbed a shell
And I pulled the trigger and Jim Johnson fell
I knew that someday it would come to this
I knew that he'd try to put his hands on sis
When people hear my story they'll understand
They'll know that what I killed was not a man
They'll know Jim Johnson was not a man

When I married Julie she was just seventeen pretty as the answer to any man's dream
From the start I gave Julie all the love that I had
But everyone told me that Julie was bad
For Julie liked parties and clothes that fit tight
Drinking and dancing and out late at night
She was everything evil with the face of a child
And I sat home and waited while my Julie went wild
I built an empire with my own two hands power and money to break any man
But with all my possessions power and gold Julie was one thing I couldn't control
Though I gave Julie all my money could buy
And begged her to love me but she wouldn't try
For she'd only laugh as she'd walk out the door
And each time she'd hurt me made me love her more
I couldn't sleep until Julie got home last night she came in but wasn't alone
The things that I heard I could hardly believe
As her and the stranger made plans to leave
Without my Julie why I just couldn't live
And this is one thing I know I could never forgive
So I wait with a pistol the bullets just three one for the stranger Julie and me
One for the stranger Julie and me

Because of this lump in my throat I can't talk very loud
But I've got to tell you bout our little son's prayer tonight
If you could've heard it honey you'd've been so proud
I'd already left a note on the table for mom and dad
As if they didn't know what was wrong
Now I asked them to take a care of him now that you and I we're both gone
After I finished the note I figured that he was alseep
So I've slipped in to see him just once more
But he was just startin' to pray and his words froze me at the door
And he said dear God it's late I hope I didn't get you up
But there's somethin' we gotta talk about
You see God my mommy was burried today
And my daddy needs straighten out
Ever since mommy got sick he's been nervous and hollered at me a lot
But that part I can't understand
Cause even a little boy like me knows that worry sometimes overload a man
But God he loved mommy so much
And he used to tel her nothing would ever come between 'em
Now I know that's what's botherin' him now cause somethin' has
And I'm afraid he's thinkin' about joinin' her somehow
God I'm glad that he loved mommy
I want him to be with her again one of these days
But I want to talk to him and tell him that first he's got me to raise
Tell him every now and then a little boy needs a helping hand
And I guess you probably still need your daddy even after you're a fullgrown man
And God if I'd lost him and mommy both it'd be more than I could stand
I know my grandma and grandpa would take care of me
Cause they both love me a whole lot
But God they're older and they don't always understand
The problems a little boy like me has got
Well God I won't bother anymore tonight
But tomorrow night I'll be sure and talk to you again
You take care of my daddy now you hear thank you Amen
I've just stood there thinkin' bout his prayer and all that he said in it
Finally I opened the door and asked him if I could talk to him for a minute
We sat down on the edge of his bed
And both took turns laughin' and cryin' for a while
And he could tell it'd been a change in me
Because for the first time in the long time I saw him smile
So darling you go on ahead but you walk slow
And someday when you'll turn around I'll be there
But it'll be a while cause I'm gonna spend the next few dozen years
Being an answer to our little boys prayer

Help me get over this love I'll handle the next love all by myself

Well my baby's not here in town tonight this old town just don't seem right
Even my old friends don't seem the same to me
Well my baby's not here in town tonight these old lights don't shine as bright
And I'm hidin' tears till I can hardly see
Well he's been acting kinda strange I should've guessed what lay ahead
But I keep wondering if it's things I've done or if it's things I've said

Porter Wagoner,Skid Row Joe,1965-12-20,1966-04-11,"

Skid Row Joe last night that's who I found in the dirty part of town
Lost forgotten with no place to go
Tormented with a bitter taste outcast by the human race
A mask of torture was the face of Skid Row Joe
He walked up to where I stood on the street
Said pardon me Mister now don't get me wrong I don't want your money
Though heaven knows I could use it
But you see this is my home and you see the other bar down the street
Well that's my home too
I noticed you starin' at me a while ago you recognized me didn't you
I said yeah Joe I know who you are
You was one time a real famous singing star one of my favorites
He said well I guess you heard they took my babies away from me
I said yeah Joe I read about it in the papers
Then he turned his head away and I saw the tears fall in the place
And he turned to me and he said you know Mister
This is the only place in the world that I'm not ashamed to show my face
But I'm gonna quit yes sir I'm gonna quit
And I'm gonna cut my hair and shave and get me a clean white shirt
Then I'm gonna walk up to her door
When she answers I'm gonna stand up real proud and tall
Then I'm gonna get on my knees
Then I'll say sweetheart if you'll take me back
I'll spend the rest of my life makin' up to you for what I've done
I'm so ashamed of myself and this I want you to know
Then I'm gonna take my two little babies and I'm gonna hold 'em so close to me
I ain't gonna never let 'em go
I guess I should've told him then that she'd already remarried again
But after hearin' what he'd said to me
Why there wasn't no way I could add to his misery
So I said good luck my best to you Skid Row Joe

Porter Wagoner,Sorrow On The Rocks,1964-04-20,1964-09-21,"

Just pour me sorrow on the rocks bartender sorrow on the rocks will do
I'm tryin' to drown my troubles so make it a double mhm mhm mhm

The seat of my pants is slick from my barstool and my hand's in the shape of a glass
My eyes look like a roadmap of Georgia and it's a shame I've lost my class
One broken heart can do strange things to a fellow who can't take pain
But in this hundred proof condition I'm in no position to take her back again
So pour me sorrow on the rocks...

Looks like the hair on my head ain't never met a comb and my face is a bearded mess
My hand shakes slightly and I have to walk lightly or I'll weave from right to left
The music on the jukebox don't mean a thing cause I'm too far gone for a song
I sure feel bad cause my baby ain't here and I'm sorry that I done her wrong
So pour me sorrow on the rocks...
So pour me sorrow on the rocks...

Porter Wagoner,The Carroll County Accident,1968-11-04,1969-03-24,"

Carroll County's pointed out as kind of square
The biggest thing that happens is the county fair
I guess that's why it seemed like such a big event
What we call the Carroll County accident

The wreck was on the highway just inside the line
Walter Browning lost his life and for a time
It seemed that Mary Ellen Jones would surely die
But she lived long enough for her to testify

Walter Browning was a happy married man
And he wore a golden wedding ring upon his hand
But it was gone, nobody kneW just where it went
He lost it in the Carroll County accident

Mary Ellen testified that he flagged her down
Said he was sick and could she drive him into town
No one ever doubted what she said was true
'Cause she was well respected in the county too

I went down to see the wreck like all the rest
The bloody seats, the broken glass, the tangled mess
But I found something no one else had ever seen
Behind the dash in Mary's crumpled up machine

A little match box circled by a rubber band
And inside the ring from Walter Browning's hand
It took awhile to figure out just what it meant
The truth about the Carroll County accident

By dark of night I dropped the ring into a well
And took a sacred oath that I would never tell
The truth about the Carroll County accident
Cause the County ordered dad a marble monument

Yes, I lost him in the Carroll County accident

I've learned to live my life just a little bit lighter
Gonna look on the lonely days a little bit brighter
My heart's been throwed around it ain't done enough laughin'
What is to be will be what ain't to be just might happen
It don't do no good to worry none
Just turns your hair gray while you're still young
Love can make you sing start your hands a clappin'
What is to be will be what ain't to be just might happen

You can't never tell when love might find you
Could be miles away or right beside you
Some makes you hurt real bad some makes you happy
What is to be will be what ain't to be just might happen
It don't do no good...

I had a love one time sent me out on a ledge
Fourteen stories high standin' on the edge

Today I burned your old love letters I burned them slowly one by one
Before I'd light the flame I'd read them to try and find the wrongs I done
The first you wrote me was the sweetest the last one broke my heart in two
And all alone I left you weeping for the ashes of your letters tied in blue

As I burned your old love letters I watched my dreams go up in smoke
I lived again those precious mem'ries I heard each tender word you spoke
The first you wrote me was the sweetest the last one said that we were through
Our love is there among the ambers in the ashes of your letters tied in blue

At the clock big daddy
Already you're a half-hour late
I've been a' pulling back the curtains
Peeping out the window
Wish you wouldn't make me wait
You better move it on home, boy
You better move it on home

Been a' sittin' here listening
To the jukebox playing
And forgettin' where I ought to be
Sipping on a cool one
Having me some good fun
Time got away from me
I better move it on home
Better move it on home

Better spin them wheels and make it on back
Where heaven on earth and love is at
Like a rolling stone
Better move it on home

I've been here a' cooking you a nice hot supper
And you can't even eat it on time
Heatin' up the meat loaf and stirring up the gravy
It's kinda got to messing up my mind
You better move it on home, boy
You better move it on home

Been a' speeding through the traffic, passing everyone
I remember what I forgot
Stepping on the gas and driving kind of fast
Hoping I won't get stopped
Better move it on home
Better move it on home

Better spin them wheels and make it on back
Where heaven on earth and love is at
Like a rolling stone
Better move it on home

Better spin them wheels and make it on back
Where heaven on earth and love is at

Better move it on home

Spoken:
Better move it on home, daddy
You're running just a little shade late
I'm on my way baby, this traffic is murder

That's what it's gonna be at home
If you don't get here soon

He preached about that great eternity
He breathed hell so hot that you could feel the heat

As we'd sing in the sweet by and by then we'd sing I'm on my way to Canaan's Land

But the aisles were all we stilled in altar call
Daddy was an old time preacher man...
Daddy worked for God but asked no pay for he believed that God provides away
We never had a lot but we got by

We've squeezed the life from every dream and still go on bluffin'
With really nothin' left to hold on to

I feel guilty when they envy me and you
We're holding on with nothin' left to hold on to

A broken heart to lose itself in the glow of city lights
Lights that say forget her name in a glass of cherry wine
Lights that offer other girls for empty hearts like mine
They paint a pretty picture of a world that's gay and bright
But it's just a mask for loneliness behind those city lights

The world was dark and God made stars to brighten up the night
The God who put the stars above I don't believe made those lights
Oh it's just a place for men to cry when things don't turn out right
Just a place to run away and hide behind those city lights

And I just can't say I love you to a street of city lights

I ran away from friends that we once knew
I tried to run from thoughts of losing you
I ran away from everybody else
But I can't run away from myself...

Ray Price,I Won't Mention It Again,1971-03-15,1971-07-19,"

I know you're tired of being all I ever wanted
You'll no longer feel the love I have for you
What happens now what will I do with all the mem'ries
And the dreams of all the things we'll never do
But I won't mention it again I won't think about tomorrow
Just let it happen live each hour day by day
But let me tell you before you go how much I love you
Then I won't mention it again I won't mention it again
I feel my life has reached an early sign of autumn
In my heart the leaves are falling love is cold
And everything that once was warm and new is gone now
Leaving nothing but this hunger in my soul
But I won't mention it again...

Ray Price,I'd Rather Be Sorry,1971-08-09,1971-11-22,"

If you hurt me you won't be the first or the last in the lifetime of many mistakes
But I won't spend tomorrow regreting the past for the chances that I didn't take
Cause I'll never know till it's over if I'm right or I'm wrong loving you
But I'd rather be sorry for something I've done than for something that I didn't do
[ strings ]
When you touch me it's easy to make me believe tomorrow won't take you away
But I'll gamble whatever tomorrow might bring of a life that I'm living today
Cause I'll never know...

Ray Price,I've Just Destroyed The World (I'm Living In),1962-05-28,1962-07-16,"

The sun just went behind a cloud
There's darkness all around me now
For I've just destroyed the world I'm livin in
I broke her heart so many times
That now at last I've broken mine
And I've just destroyed the world I'm livin in
What made me think that I could go on hurting Her
I should have known there'd have to be an end
But fools in love are taught by fate
They never learn till it's too Late
And I've just destroyed the world I'm livin in
What made me think that I could go on hurting Her
I should have known there'd have to be an end
But fools in love are taught by fate
They never learn till it's too Late
And I've just destroyed the world I'm livin in

I wonder what the power is that you hold over me
I never get to love you long just your memory
And I make a vow each time you leave that this will draw the line
Then you come back and just like now I'm falling one more time
One more time my lips may kiss you one more time my arms will hold you
But it won't belong until you're gone with a mem'ry left behind
And I just know that when you go I'll be lonely one more time
[ steel ]
Your nearness makes me weaken and I give into you
And I'm doing all the things I said that I wouldn't do
And I make a vow each time you leave that this will draw the line
Then you come back and just like now I'm falling one more time
One more time my lips may kiss you...

But how can I leave you when I love you so
Which way should I turn I'd sure like to know
My heart tells me stay but my pride tells me go

She wears my my ring to show the world that she belongs to me
She wears my ring to show the world she's mine eternaly
With loving care I place it on her finger to show my love for all the world to see

I'm out late every night
Doing things that ain't right
And she'll cry for me
When I'm down in the dumps
And she nurses my lumps
How she cries for me

And she'll never complain
She keeps hiding the pain
But I know all the while
She's not feeling too well
'Cause I put her through hell
Still she forces a smile

She's got to be a saint
Lord know that I ain't
I finally realize
Right before my eyes
Here is a saint

There's a dress in a shop
That'll make her eyes pop
But she'll look away
She'd have gotten a lift
If I'd bought her that gift
For her birthday

But her birthday has come
And I feel like a bum
'Cause I spent my last dime
On a worthless old friend
On a drunken weekend
I've done it time after time

She's got to be a saint
Lord know that I ain't
I finally realize
Right before my eyes
Here is a saint

Should I stay? Should I go?
I really don't know
My mind's in a blur
Soon it's gonna be dawn
And if she finds me gone
Would it be best for her?

I see her cry in her sleep
So I kiss her wet cheek
I kneel by her and pray
And I'll turn off the light
Step out in the night
And I'll go on my way

She's got to be a saint
Lord know that I ain't
I finally realize
Right before my eyes
Here is a saint

All the little children of the world

There is none so blind
That is he who will not see

We must let our thought be free
For every hour that passes by

Gets a little bit older

That beauty lies
In the eyes of the beholder

Everything is beautiful
In its' own way
Like a starry summer nights
Or a snow covered winter's day
Ah, sing it, children

Everybody's beautiful

We shouldn't care
About the length of his hair
Or the color of his skin
Don't worry about what shows from without
But the love that lives within
We're gonna get it all together now

Everything gonna work out fine
Just take a little time
To look on the good side my friend
And straighten it out in your mind

Everything is beautiful
In its' own way
Like a starry summer nights
Or a snow covered winter's day
Ah, sing it, children

Everybody's beautiful
In their own way
Under God's heaven
The world's gonna find a way

One more time
Everything is beautiful
In its' own way
Like a starry summer nights

Red Simpson,I'm A Truck,1971-12-06,1972-03-20,"

Hello I'm a truck
You've heard songs about truck drivers many times their stories told
How they pulled out of Pittsburg for six days on the road
Bout the Feather River Canyon and climbin' the old grapevine
That old roadhouse down in Texas and the girls they've left behind
You've heard their tales of daring and I think that's just fine
But if you can spare a minute well I'd like to tell you mine
There'd be no truck drivers if it wasn't for us trucks
No double clutching gear jaming coffee drinking nuts
They'll drive their way to glory and they have all the luck
There'd be no truck drivers if it wasn't for us trucks

Well there he sits in that cafe drinking coffee and telling lies
Prob'ly telling 'em how to talk that hill ten miles back
How telling 'em how he missed a gear and that Volkswagen full of hippies
Passed us like I was sitting up on jacks or how we took that curve over on 66
Han't-a been for me hanging on the shoulder we'd both wound up in the ditch
If we're on time he takes the credit if we're late I get the blame
Up those hills with shutters open my stacks are running flame
My stack a running red light sucking diesel from the tanks
I take him south and bring him back without a word of thanks
So now you've heard my story and I guess it's my tough luck
There'd be no truck drivers if it wadn't for us trucks
There'd be no truck drivers...

Look at him sipping coffee and flirtin' with that waitress
And where do you think he left me that's right next to cattle truck (mooo)
Why couldn't we have put me next to that little pink mack sittin' over there
Gosh she's got pretty mud flaps and talk about stracked they're both chromed
Well he'll be coming out in a minute and he'll get that bar
And he'll go around and beat on my tires
You know for two pints of diesel I'd have a flat on the inside dual
Ha that fixed him I never did like the way he drives anyhow
Thainks he's God's gift to waitresses he never gives 'em a tip
Well I know what he's gonna do now he's gonna take out
The tape cartridge of Back Owens and play it again
I don't know why he don't get a Merle Haggard tape

Another eighty miles and I sure am lonesome cause I'll be late gettin' home
Roll truck roll take me to my baby I'm tired of bein' alone
Roll truck roll I wanna see my baby roll truck roll me on home

One of these days I'm gonna quit this old road when I've saved enough money
Gonna buy me a place back home and live a little just me and my kids and my honey
Mama said little Danny's not doing too good in school
Said he keeps talkin' about his daddy that he hardly knows
Teacher said that he just sits at his desk and draws the pictures of trucks
I guess I know what that means and what it shows
Why I'm not home three months out of the year
And here lately it's showing on me too
I saw a lot of country at first and I really like it then
But anymore there's just none of it new
Oh what a long old haul this has been
I've had rain most of the way and now it's beginning to pour
It sure looks cold that wind blowin' up through that canyon
But I gotta keep my spirits up so I guess I'll sing a little more
I'm going down to Feather River Canyon...

Dream house for sale
Maybe it's meant for you
If you're among the lucky ones
That have found a love that's true

[Verse 1]
I was looking through the morning paper
Like a lot of us do everyday
When I saw an ad that caught my eye
This is what it had to say
One dream house for sale
Its a bargain for nothing down
And there's no closing cost for the dreams I lost
When the girl I love left town
There's five rooms, a bath on an acre of land
And a nursery painted pink and blue
A baby bed and a little white high chair
And it's all almost new
There's a sad-eyes old dog and a picket fence
Around a yard that's full of weeds
Why just one look and its easy to see
A little love is all that it needs

[Chorus]
Dream house for sale
Maybe it's meant for you
If you're among the lucky ones
That have found a love that's true

[Verse 2]
The only thing wrong with this house of mine
Is the black cloud that hangs above
I guess it's there to keep out the sunshine
Since mine's a house without love
That's just about all there is to tell
About a boy and his love that failed
Four words tell the rest of my story
Dream house for sale

[Chorus]
Dream house for sale
Maybe it's meant for you
If you're among the lucky ones
That have found a love that's true

Red Sovine,I Didn't Jump The Fence,1967-02-20,1967-05-01,"

(She's the one got lonely I didn't jump the fence)
Mr Angry neighbor yes I know just how you feel
Cause I've been taking your fruit but don't tell me I steal
I haven't been in your yard my tracks ain't on your ground
Your tree hangs over my fence the nights you're not around
I didn't jump the fence the fruit was offered free
I couldn't reach your apples if you just trimmed the tree
Well sure I've held your darling but Mister where's your sence
She's the one got lonely I didn't jump the fence

Now friend you see that little trail that runs between our home
These ain't the shoes that wore it there the nights that you were gone
So don't show me your anger or shout I stole a kiss
When she did all the walking I didn't jump the fence
I didn't jump the fence...

Keep our love locked in your heart

Keep my love locked in your heart
And promise you'll be true
So keep my love locked in your heart, in your heart

There's a hummin' sound that's been around
Me for years
In my second home here in this cab
Shifting lots of gears
The longest miles are the ones that
End up gear one
But here I am the last mile
A long night home

Its gonna be a long night, a hard night
It'll seem like weeks 'til daylight
Oh Jimmy won't you give me what you got and let's make up time
And roll on
She's got a new gown that I gotta see
The way she talked on the phone boy its bothering me
Its gonna be a long night, a hard night
A long night home

There's a truck stop just up ahead
That'll ease my pain
I'll get refueled and fight a duel
With the fog and rain
Then once again my thoughts turn back to what she said
All dressed up, just watching the door
Waiting patiently

Its gonna be a long night, a hard night
It'll seem like weeks 'til daylight
Oh Jimmy won't you give me what you got and let's make up time
And roll on
She's got a new gown that I gotta see
The way she talked on the phone boy its bothering me
Its gonna be a long night, a hard night
A long night home

Can't wait to see what she's got due
If she's wearing that gown I know what I'll do
Gonna be a long night, a hard night
A long night home

Red Sovine,Phantom 309,1967-08-07,1967-11-06,"

I was out on the West Coast, tryin' to make a buck
And things didn't work out, I was down on my luck
Got tired a-roamin' and bummin' around
So I started thumbin' back East, toward my home town

Made a lot of miles, the first two days
And I figured I'd be home in week, if my luck held out this way
But, the third night I got stranded, way out of town
At a cold, lonely crossroads, rain was pourin' down

I was hungry and freezin', done caught a chill
When the lights of a big semi topped the hill
Lord, I sure was glad to hear them air brakes come on
And I climbed in that cab, where I knew it'd be warm

At the wheel sit a big man, he weighed about two-ten
He stuck out his hand and said with a grin
""Big Joe's the name"", I told him mine
And he said: ""The name of my rig is Phantom 309.""

I asked him why he called his rig such a name
He said: ""Son, this old Mack can put 'em all to shame
There ain't a driver, or a rig, a-runnin' any line
Ain't seen nothin' but taillights from Phantom 309.""

Well, we rode and talked the better part of the night
When the lights of a truck stop came in sight
He said: ""I'm sorry son, this is as far as you go
'Cause, I gotta make a turn, just on up the road.""

Well, he tossed me a dime as he pulled her in low
And said: ""Have yourself a cup on old Big Joe.""
When Joe and his rig roared out in the night
In nothin' flat, he was clean out of sight

Well, I went inside and ordered me a cup
Told the waiter Big Joe was settin' me up
Aw!, you coulda heard a pin drop, it got deathly quiet
And the waiter's face turned kinda white

Well, did I say something wrong? I said with a halfway grin
He said: ""Naw, this happens every now and then
Ever' driver in here knows Big Joe
But son, let me tell you what happened about ten years ago

At the crossroads tonight, where you flagged him down
There was a bus load of kids, comin' from town
And they were right in the middle, when Big Joe topped the hill
It could have been slaughter, but he turned his wheel

Well, Joe lost control, went into a skid
And gave his life to save that bunch-a kids
And there at that crossroads, was the end of the line
For Big Joe and phantom 309

But, every now and then, some hiker'll come by
And like you, Big Joe'll give 'em a ride
Here, have another cup and forget about the dime
Keep it as a souvenir, from Big Joe and Phantom 309!""

Red Sovine,Tell Maude I Slipped,1967-12-18,1968-02-26,"

Tell Maude I slipped and fell
Hurt myself real bad oh almost tore me all apart
Tell Maude I slipped and fell
Just a few cuts and bruises mostly
It nearly broke my heart

She made it know that she would break my will
And I'll admit she gave me quite a spill
Tell Maude I slipped and I fell
Just the way she said I would
But tell her she cant hold me down

Tell Maude I slipped and fell
Accidents sure can happen
And mine nearly got me down
Tell Maude I slipped and fell
But I had enough strength left inside me
To make it out of town

She thought the pain she caused would always last
I got her bad but I recovered fast
Tell Maude I slipped and fell
Just the way she said I would
But tell her she can't hold me down
Just tell her she can't hold me down

Rex Allen,Don't Go Near The Indians,1962-09-24,1962-12-17,"

{Son, don't go near the Indians
Please stay away
Son, don't go near the Indians
Please do what I say}

Since I was just a little boy
I liked to roam the hills
And to hear wild stories about the Indians
Was my biggest thrill

I'd shout and yell and holler like heck
I wore moccasins on my feet
And I'd make believe I was under a teepee
Every time I went to sleep

My hair was jet black and I was twenty-one
Lots of pretty girls around
But the paleface maidens didn't thrill me none
Around my Cochise County hometown

{Son, don't go near the Indians
Please stay away
Son, don't go near the Indians
Please do what I say}

One day I went to the reservation
And there by a shallow creek
Was a beautiful Indian a-fetchin' water
And I just had to speak

She smiled at me then quickly left
But the next day she returned
And it wasn't very long till I told her how
The love in my heart burned

{Son, don't go near the Indians
Please stay away
Son, don't go near the Indians
Please do what I say}

I told my daddy I'd found a girl
Who meant the world to me
And tomorrow I'd ask the Indian chief
For the hand of NovaLee

Dad's trembling lips spoke softly
As he told me of my life
Twas then he said I could never take
This maiden for my wife

SPOKEN:
Son, the white man and Indianss were fighting when you were born
And a brave called Yellow Sun scalped my little boy
So I stole you to get even for what he'd done
Though you're a full-blooded Indian, son
I love you as much as my own little feller that's dead
And, son, NovaLee is your sister
And that's why I've always said

SINGING:
{Son, don't go near the Indians
Please stay away
Son, don't go near the Indians
Please do what I say}

Rick Nelson,Garden Party,1972-10-16,1972-11-06,"

[Verse 1]
I went to a garden party to reminisce with my old friends
A chance to share old memories and play our songs again
When I got to the garden party, they all knew my name
No one recognized me, I didn't look the same

[Chorus]
But it's all right now, I learned my lesson well
You see, ya can't please everyone, so ya got to please yourself

[Verse 2]
And people came from miles around, everyone was there
Yoko brought her walrus, there was magic in the air
An' over in the corner, much to my surprise
Mr. Hughes hid in Dylan's shoes wearing his disguise

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Played them all the old songs, thought that's why they came
No one heard the music, we didn't look the same
I said, hello to ""Mary Lou"", she belongs to me
When I sang a song about a honky-tonk, it was time to leave

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
Someone opened up a closet door and out stepped Johnny B. Goode
Playing guitar like a-ringin' a bell and lookin' like he should
If you gotta play at garden parties, I wish you a lotta luck
But if memories were all I sang, I rather drive a truck

[Chorus 2x]

Ain't nothin' but a fool would live like this

Dang me, dang me

High from the highest tree

Just sittin' 'round drinkin' with the rest of the guys
Six rounds bought and I bought five
I spent the groceries and a half the rent
I lack fourteen dollars havin' twenty seven cents

Dang me, dang me

High from the highest tree
Woman would you weep for me?

They say roses are red and violets are purple
And sugar's sweet and so is maple syrple

Engine, Engine No. 9, coming down the railroad line
How much farther back did she get off?
Old brown suitcase that she carried, I've looked for it everywhere
It just ain't here among the rest and I'm a little upset

Yes, tell me Engine, Engine No. 9, coming down the railroad line
I know she got on in Baltimore
A hundred and ten miles ain't much distance, but
It sure do make a difference, I don't think she loves me anymore

I warned her of the dangers, don't speak to strangers
If by chance she find new romance, warmer lips to kiss her
Arms to hold her tighter, stirring new fires inside her
How I wish that it was me instead of he that stands beside her

Engine, Engine No. 9, coming down the railroad line
I know she got on in Baltimore

Take a tip before you take your trip; let me tell you where to go

Falling out the window sill, frolic in the grass
Tryin' to mock the way they talk fun but all in vain

Well I wake up in the morning
With my hair down in my eyes and she says 'hi'
Then I stumble to the breakfast table
Where the kids are going off to school, goodbye
Then she reaches out takes my hand and squeezes it
And says 'how you feeling hon'
Then I look across the smiling lips
That warms my heart and see my morning sun

And if that's not loving me all then all I've got to say
God didn't make those little green apples
It don't rain in Indianapolis in the summer time
And there's no such thing as Dr. Seuss, or Disney Land
Or Mother Goose or nursery rhymes
God didn't make those little green apples
It don't rain in indianapolis in the summer time

And when myself is feeling low I think about her face aglow
To ease my mind

Sometimes I call her up at home knowing she's busy
And asked her if she can get away and meet me
And grab a bite to eat
And she drops what she's doing hurries down to meet me
And I'm always late
But she sits waiting patiently smiles when she first sees me
'Cause she's made that way

And if that's not loving me all then all I've got to say

God didn't make little green apples
And It don't snow in Indianapolis when the winter comes
And there's no such thing as make believe

I have seen the morning burning golden on the mountain in the skies
Aching with the feeling of the freedom of an eagle when she flies

Turning on the world the way she smiled upon my soul as I lay dying
Healing as the colours in the sunshine and the shadows of her eyes

Waking in the morning to the feeling of her fingers on my skin
Wiping out the traces of the people and places that I've been

Teaching me that yesterday was something that I never thought of tring
Talking of tomorrow and the money, love and time we had to spend
Loving her was easier than anything I'll ever do again
Coming close together with a feeling that I've never known before

In my time

She ain't ashamed to be a woman or afraid to be a friend
And I don't know the answer to the easy way she opened every door

In my mind

But dreaming was as easy as believing it was never gonna end
And loving her was easier than anything I'll ever do again

I took my har'poon out of my dirty red bandana
And was blowin' sad while Bobby sang the blues
With them windshield whipers slappin' time
And Bobby clappin' hands we finally sang up every song that driver knew
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' ain't worth nothin' but it's free
Feeling good was easy Lord when Bobby sang the blues
Feeling good was good enough for me good enough for me and Bobby McGee

From the coal mines of Kentucky to the California sun
Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Standin' right beside me Lord through everything I done
And every night she kept me from the cold
Then somewhere near Salinas Lord I let her slip away
Lookin' for the home I hope she'll find
I'd trade all my tomorrows for a single yesterday holdin' Bobby's body next to mine

Who'll bid me quarter, thirty cents for a ring of keys
Three sixty-five for a dollar bill of groceries
I'll have me a car of my own someday but 'til then I need a ride (thanks Steve)
My uncle used to love me but she died

My uncle used to love but she died
A chicken ain't chicken 'til he's licken good and fried
Keep on the sunny side
My uncle used to live me but she died

Hamburger cup of coffee lettuce and tomato
Two times a dime to see a man kiss the alligater
One more time around free on the ferris wheel ride
My uncle used to love me but she died

My uncle used to love but she died
A chicken ain't chicken 'til he's licken good and fried
Keep on the sunny side
My uncle used to live me but she died

Apples are for eatin and snakes are for hissin
I've heard about a'huggin and I've heard about kissin
I read about it free in a fifty cent illustrated guide
My uncle used to love me but she died

My uncle used to love but she died
A chicken ain't chicken 'til he's licken good and fried
Keep on the sunny side
My uncle used to live me but she died

Well my uncle used to love but she died

Roger Miller,One Dyin' And A Buryin',1965-07-19,1965-10-04,"

Well, I think I finally found me a sure-fire way to forget
It's so simple, I'm surprised I hadn't done thought of it before yet
It's foolproof - well, it's foolhardy, maybe, but who knows
Anyway, here I am walking toward where the cold dark water flows
Cos all it takes is:

One dying and a buryin'
One dying and a buryin'
Some crying
Six carrying me
I wanna be free

Oh...I wanna be free
Free from all this heartache and regret
And free from pining for the love I can't forget
The love that once was warm and then just somehow turned to hate
Made my life a prison from which there's only one escape
And that's:

One dying and a buryin'
One dying and a buryin'
Some cryin'
Six carryin' me
I wanna be free

One dying and a buryin'
One dying and a buryin'
Some cryin'
Six carryin' me
I wanna be free

Open up your heart
Jiggle it a little, it'll open
Tickle it a little, it'll fly
Right on up to the sky

Don't live your life
Sittin' somewhere in a corner
Don't be a little Jack Horner
With nothing in life but a pie

Don't be afraid
To dig a little giggling n laughter
After all what are we after
Don't let it all pass you by

Open up your heart
Jiggle it a little, it'll open
Tickle it a little' it'll fly
Right on up to the sky

Open up your heart
Jiggle it a little, it'll open
Tickle it a little' it'll fly
Right on up to the sky

Open up your heart
Jiggle it a little, it'll open
Tickle it a little' it'll fly

Roger Miller,The Ballad Of Waterhole #3 (Code Of The West),1967-11-06,1968-01-01,"

I'll tell you a story that's never been told
Of rapin' and killin'
And government gold
The place Arizona
The year '84
Sit back and I'll tell you some more

A thirty year captain
Just earnin' his pay
Was movin' a shipment of bullion that day
While men without honor were waitin' to test
The unwritten code of the west

It's the code of the west
You must honor your neighbor
The code of the west
To your own self be true
The code of the west
You must do unto others
Do unto others before they do it unto you

Sweet yellow, sweet yellow
Sweet tangerine gold
You make a man fevered you make a man bold

So the town of Delores that morning in May
Was in for an infamous day

You don't draw with the stranger
If he's faster than you
You've sung your last ditty
You've kissed your last pretty
And played yer last hand if you do

When fate is the dealer you raise or you call
A chance takin' man plays the cards as they fall
A map worth a killin' is worth trackin' down
So off to Integrity town
The code of the west ain't some words on a page
You just naturally know it when you come of age
You eat when you're hungry, you drink when you're dry
You look every man in the eye

It's the code of the west when the boys talk of women
The code of the west what you know you don't tell
The code of the west a man soaps his own saddle
Brands his own cattle and some of his neighbour's as well

If you're buildin' fences then I ain't for hire
You get me for nothin' and I'll bring the wire
You patch up my windows, I'll plumb up your doors
If you scratch my back I'll scratch yours

It's the code of the west you must honour your neighbour
The code of the west to your own self be true
The code of the west you must do unto others
Do unto others before them others do it unto you

A yellow haired woman is early to bloom
Her laughter is roses
Her smile is perfume
But the child of the lawman can die on the vine
With no man to take of her wine

It's the code of the west
You don't leave for tomorrow
The code of the west
What can be done today
The code of the west
It's a true fact of livin'
What so lovingly given will lovingly come back yer way

The desert was losing its fight with the sun
As Cole stopped for water at hole number 1
Just what was he chasin' he'd sure like to know
But he still had him two holes to go

The code of the west
Show your backside to evil
The code of the west
Give the devil his due
The code of the west
You must do unto others
Do unto others before they do it unto you

Now rapin' and killin'
Ain't really so bad
But stealin' ole Blue
Now that made sheriff John mad
You don't help yourself to the eggs in the nest
Of the man with the badge on his vest

For tumbleweeds tumblin' from boulder to stone
Your permanent address is places unknown
You eat when your hungry
You drink when your dry
If wishes were eagles you'd fly

Rest your head on your saddle
Dream of fortune and fame
When the winds in the willow
A girl hugs her pillow
And wishes that she knew his name

Now treat a girl tender
She'll preen like a bride
But take her for granted
She'll come for your hide

She'll shoot off your head
If you leave her behind
And you'll loose your natural mind

Sweet yellow, sweet yellow, sweet tangerine gold
You make a man fevered you make a man bold
Your warm like a woman a treasure to hold
Sweet yellow sweet tangerine gold
You make a man fevered you make a man bold
Sweet yellow sweet tangerine gold

You got to do unto others
Do unto others before they do unto you

When a showdown is comin'
When a shootout is due
Face up to the danger
Throw a slug into a stranger
Before he throws one into you
You gotta do unto others
Do unto others before they do unto you

While Ben was playin' steal the gold and make your gettaway
The other three played shoot em up and turnabouts fair play
But Ben had tasted painted lips and heard the sirns song
So he could hardly keep from going wrong
It's the code of the west
Heed the word of your sisters
The code of the west
Make a left turn from sin
The code of the west
Keep an eye on temptation, recite the quotation
That says when Satan calls your name it doesn't matter
How you played the game 'cause all he cares about is
Did you win?

Now Cole and John and Henry J were feelin' mighty sad
To think a little sack of gold could turn a good man bad
But when you picked em meek and mild against the brave and bold
The meek inherit all the armys gold
Now in the meantime Billie girl was scemeing on her own
She know a healthy sweet young thing could live by bread alone
To play the tricky game of life a woman needs a plan
To play the game of love she needs a man

Now Lewton Cole know Billie had some mighty fetchin' ways
Ol' Ben would tell her everything and still get ninety days
Beneath the rock beside the trail that leads to Mexico
You'll find yourself a hundred pounds or so

It's the code of the west
Every girl needs a dowery
The code of the west
And it don't matter whose
The code of the west
When a girls pushin' twenty
She's gotta end up with plenty
If she wants to end up with rice in her shoes

Well Cole had a few other things left to do
He flowered his Stetson
And boarded ol Blue

The rougher you treat em
The stronger they grieve
And the longer they watch when you leave

Oh Mexico is just ahead so gambler move along

There ain't nobody there to care if you did right or wrong
You shot a thief ,you found some gold you stole a kiss or two
And the worlds a better place because of you

Oh the code of the west
When you're drinkin' toquilla
The code of the west
Toast the red white and blue
The code of the west
Be kind to your neighbors
Your new northern neighbors
Remember they've been awfully good to you!!

The cowboys are the greatest, the clown he is so funny
You bust your britches laughing, at the Tom Greene county fair

Well a Sunday at the fair can make a memory more valuable than gold
Especially when you're ten years old

Just like an airplane in the sky, that's how you feel
Look down and see the people, wave your arms and holler

Night time comes
Up there on the bandstand we see Billy Swan
Everybody's clappin', Mum and Pop are dancin'

And all of us kids sit backwards, lookin' thru the dustcloud

Roger Miller,Tomorrow Night In Baltimore,1971-04-19,1971-07-12,"

Her head rolls back and forth
Against the billows of her long black shiny hair
As she contemplates the ecstasy
Of some other love that now she wished was there

If she could only realise that the love I have could beckon her command
Instead of laughing endlessly and pushing back advances with her hands

Every night I see her leaves a nightmare of illusions when she's gone
And it leaves a longing feeling in a man with a pain that lingers on

The gaudy goodbye can't replace the girlish giggle of her sweet hello
But tonight I've made my crumbled mind up that I'll never ever let her go

Too many nights I've watched her tease by shifting all her weight from hip to hip
And with her hands brush back the falling strands that cover up her satin lips

She struts upon the stage and her fallen victims are calling out for more
But she leaves them stranded helplessly and exits to her dressing room door

Tonight I'm gonna take her, I've infiltrated past the guarded door
But she just hurries by me carrying all those scanty costumes that she wore

And she asks a sawed off cigar smoking cat if he would open up the door
Then she told him to load the baggage because they open tomorrow night in Baltimore

God' if I have to crawl, I'm gonna be there tomorrow night in Baltimore

Roger Miller,Vance,1968-12-09,1969-02-24,"

He was born one mornin' it was cold and it was snowin'
And from the start he never had a chance
And though the doctors said he couldn't live his mama had some faith to give
And they brought him to her and his mama named him Vance
He was sick a long time then I used to sit by him
I'd rub his head he would squeeze my hand
But he never cried he'd grit his teeth and smile at me cause he couldn't speak
And that's when I began to respect the little man
And I think Vance was three right about then
He started school and one day he came home and at the doorway
I could tell the little man didn't want to come inside
He'd met a girl but her boyfriend Smitty
Had caught him walkin' home with her and nearly killed Vance
But then Vance never cried and the only thing that Smitty hurt was pride
And he said papa do you become a man when you're twenty one
And I said age doesn't make a man a man my son
He looked at me so puzzled with eyes so young and kind
And I think Vance was seven about that time

I guess they say that first love is the very best
At least it was with Vance cause he'd scratched Becky on his desk
But Becky went with Smitty and Vance was very small
And he used to dream what it'd be like to be tall
And then a few years later Vance came in one day
And told me and his mama that he had to go away
To be fitted for a uniform and though his mama shed a tear
He kissed her and said he'd see us in two years
And he looked at me and said papa I'm gonna be a man
Well two years to the day Vance came walkin' in the driveway
And I didn't recognize him from his size till he got near
He came in and he hugged his mama
And said hey papa little man wanna go with me somewhere and grab a beer
So we're sittin' at this table when this fella at the bar started buggin' Vance
Callin' him soldier but Vance kept his cool
And he said papa that guy is Smitty and he's to be pitied now
Cause that's the same guy that used to bully me in school
Then Smitty said the wrong thing when he brought up Becky's name
And Vance finally stood and said boy what did you say
And it did my heart so much good when Vance hit ole Smitty
And it took two of Smitty's friends to carry him away
Well Vance left the very next mornin' and it was cold and it was snowin'
And from the first life hadn't been much fun
But he had finally made a stand and he'd become a self made man
And incidentally he had just turned twenty one

The people in this city call me country
Because of how I walk and talk and smile
Well, I don't mind them laughing in the city
But the country folks all say I'm citified

The fighting men they say that I'm a coward
Because I never push no one around
Gentle people call me trouble maker
'Cause I'll always fight and stand my ground

Funny I don't fit
Where have all the average people gone?

Some pious people point and call me sinner
Because to them I've never seen the lights
Other folks think of me as a preacher
I'm just doing what I think is right

The wealthy people think that I am a hobo
Lean and hungry, writing mournful songs
And the poor, poor people think I am a rich man
But really, I'm just trying to get along

It's funny I don't fit
Tell me where have all the average people gone?

And the government has given me a number
To simplify my birth and life and death
And still my woman thinks I'm awful important
Like the moon and the sun and the sea and the sky and breath

Yes, it's funny I don't fit
Where have all the average people gone?
Funny I don't fit
Where have all the average people gone?

And you do not hide your face because somebody said one time it wasn't natural
What a joy for us just running down this crooked trail of midnight
And the peaceful things inside me that it does
Then you whisper low I have to go the acid tears start coming slow
To complicate a simple thing as love

Awake now I don't hear the floorboards creaking as you walk back from the window
Or feel your satin fingers drawing patterns on my back where I lay dying
Without you I'm a child who sucks the vacant thumb of emptiness
Left crying when he has not had enough
At the mercy of an empty room sing verses to some faded wall
Confused about a simple thing as love

It's too bad we couldn't stay here till the clock runs out and falls from sheer exhaustion
Or till morning when I watch you as you stoop to pick your things up from the floor
But too soon for us it's over and the shock of the electric lightbulb
Sunrise from the ceiling up above
As it dangles to remind us of the spiderweb that binds us
And just complicates a simple thing as love

Awake now I don't hear the floorboards creaking as you walk back from the window
Or feel your satin fingers drawing patterns on my back where I lay dying

But most of all I'm glad you show just how much you need me

I still get that honeymoon feeling
After all these years my heart goes reeling
Every time you touch me it's the living end
I still get that honeymoon feeling
I can still hear those wedding bells ringing
Every time we love I get that honeymoon feeling again

I still get that honeymoon feeling
After all these years my heart goes reeling
Every time you touch me it's the living end
I still get that honeymoon feeling
I can still hear those wedding bells ringing
Every time we love I get that honeymoon feeling again...

Roy Clark,I Never Picked Cotton,1970-06-15,1970-09-07,"

I never picked cotton
But my mother did and my brother did
And my sister did and my daddy died young
Workin' in the coal mine

When I was just a baby too little for a cotton sack
I played in the dirt while the others worked till they couldn't straighten their backs
And I made myself a promise when I was big enough to run
That I'd never stay a single day in that Oklahoma sun

And I never picked cotton
But my mother did and my brother did
And my sister did and my daddy died young
Workin' in the coal mine

Folks said I grew up early and in the farm that couldn't hold me then
So I stole ten bucks and a pickup truck and I never went back again
And it was fast cars and whiskey long haired girls and fun
I had everything that money could bring and I took it all with a gun

But I never picked cotton
But my mother did and my brother did
And my sister did and my daddy died young
Workin' in the coal mine

It was Saturday night in Memphis when a redneck grabbed my shirt
And when he said go back in your cotton sack I let 'im dyin' in the dirt
They'd take me in the mornin' to the gallows just outside
And in the time I've got there ain't a hullava lot that I can look back on with pride

But I never picked cotton
But my mother did and my brother did
And my sister did and my daddy died young
Workin' in the coal mine

But I never picked cotton
But my mother did and my brother did
And my sister did and my daddy died young
Workin' in the coal mine...

Roy Clark,Right Or Left At Oak Street,1969-12-15,1970-01-26,"

The alarm rang at seven this morning
The same time it did yesterday
Seven-thirty is my breakfast time
And I know what the wife's gonna say

The Crawfords next door got a new swimming pool
The Millers got a color TV
Mr. Wilson's job is not good as yours
But his wife dresses better than me

I get to the school at eight o-five
And drop off the kids at the gate
Then I drive past the clock outside the bank
It's exactly a quarter past eight

When I reach the stop sign at Oak Street
The same thought crosses my mind
Should I turn right like I always have
Or left and leave it behind?

Right or left at Oak Street
That's the choice I face everyday
And I don't know which takes more courage
The staying or the running away

A left turn would take me to somewhere
Leave alarm clocks and schedules behind
And the world wouldn't care if I'm not somewhere
At some particular time

Where a man can do what he wants to do
And no one expects him to give
All of his time to the same old routine
In the one life that he has to live

I'm not sure which way is the best way
But I've always turned right before
And it might be strange at the end of the day
If they weren't there at the door

A man must make his decisions
But he must consider the stakes
For every mans life is a gamble
It depends on the turn that he takes

Right or left at Oak Street
That's the choice I face everyday
And I don't know which takes more courage
The staying or the running away...

Roy Clark,September Song,1969-10-13,1969-11-03,"

When I was a young man courtin' the girls
I played me a waiting game
If a maid refused me with tossin' curls
I let this old world take a couple of whirls
While I plied her with tears instead of pearls
And as time came along she came my way
As time came along she came

But it's a long long time from May to December
But the days grow short when you reach September
And when the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame
And one hasn't got time for the waiting game

Oh, the days dwindle down to a precious few
September and November
But these few precious days I'll spend with you
These precious days I'll spend with you

Oh, the days dwindle down to a precious few
September and November
But these few precious days I'll spend with you
These precious days I'll spend with you...

Roy Clark,Somewhere Between Love And Tomorrow,1973-11-12,1974-02-04,"

You gave your love completely
And warmed my life, so cold
But she stills lives between us
And our story must be told

Today, she thinks I love her
But tomorrow, we'll be through
And somewhere between love and tomorrow
She'll have to know about you

We vowed to love forever
And never be untrue
But time can change and rearrange
Your world from green to blue

But then you came to love me
And you made the sun shine through
And somewhere between love and tomorrow
She'll have to know about you

It's sad for love to die now
After all that we've been through
But somewhere between love and tomorrow
I fell in love with you

I've made a small fortune and you squandered it all
You shamed me till I feel about one inch tall
But I thought I loved you and I hoped you would change
So I gritted my teeth and didn't complain

Now you come to me with a simple goodbye
You tell me you're leaving but you won't tell me why
Now we're here at the station and you're getting on
And all I can think of is thank God and Greyhound you're gone

Thank God and Greyhound you're gone
I didn't know how much longer I could go on
Watching you take the respect out of me
Watching you make a total wreck out of me
That big diesel motor is a-playing my song
Thank God and Greyhound you're gone

Thank God and Greyhound you're gone
I didn't know how much longer I could go on
Watching you take the respect out of me
Watching you make a total wreck out of me
That big diesel motor is a playing my song
Thank God and Greyhound you're gone

Oh, thank God and Greyhound you're gone
That load on my mind got lighter when you got on
That shiny old bus is a beautiful sight
With the black smoke a rolling up around the tail lights
It may sound kinda cruel but I've been silent too long
Thank God and Greyhound you're gone

Thank God and Greyhound you're gone...

Roy Clark,Then She's A Lover,1970-02-02,1970-03-16,"

She comes in about six o'clock
Tripping over toys
And picking up socks
And you think her day
Had been a ton of trouble

She's been doing important things
With trading stamps
And turnip greens
And have I noticed how
The price of soap has doubled

She's as normal as she can be
She never misses Jeopardy
And I think that she'd elope
With Dick Van Dyke

And when the kids have all been fed
And when I lay me down to bed
She gives me my time of the night

Then she's a lover
She comes to my side
Right around midnight
After her day's been so confused

That's why I love her
And that's why I do right
And if there's a reason
God gave me a feeling
Baby, it's you

She hates tangerines
She loves the ring
Volunteers me for everything
And the bank has never
Been right in her life

She thinks my Uncle Bill's a sap
She's taught me words like overdraft
The only numbers she remembers
Is her shoe size

She had words with the guy next door
And almost started a neighborhood war
Cause he said something smart
To our son, Bob

And therefore, I had to invite him in
To apologize and convince him
She really didn't think he was
A big, fat slob

She's as normal as she can be
She never misses Jeopardy
And I think that she'd elope
With Dick Van Dyke

But when the kids have all been fed
And when I lay me down to bed
She gives me my time of the night

Then she's a lover
She comes to my side
Right around midnight
After her day's been so confused

That's why I love her
And that's why I do right
And if there's a reason
God gave me a feeling
Baby, it's you

Then she's a lover
She comes to my side...

I reached out my arms and I touched you
With soft words I whispered your name
I had your love on the tips of my fingers
Oh, but that was as close as I came

My eyes had a vision of sweet lips
Yielding beneath my command
I had your love on the tips of my fingers
But I let it slip right through my hands
But I let it slip right through my hands

Somebody took you when I wasn't looking
And I should have known from the start
That it's a long, long way from the tips of my fingers
To the love hidden deep in your heart
To the love hidden deep in your heart

I had your love on the tips of my fingers
But I let you slip right through my hands

Yes, I let you slip right through my hands...

Roy Clark,"Yesterday, When I Was Young",1969-06-23,1969-09-15,"

Yesterday when I was young
The taste of life was sweet as rain upon my tongue
I teased at life as if it were a foolish game
The way the evening breeze may tease a candle flame
The thousand dreams I dreamed, the splendid things I planned
I always built alas on weak and shifting sand
I lived by night and shunned the naked light of the day
And only now I see how the years ran away

Yesterday when I was young
So many drinking songs were waiting to be sung
So many wayward pleasures lay in store for me
And so much pain my dazzled eyes refused to see
I ran so fast that time and youth at last ran out
I never stopped to think what life was all about
And every conversation I can now recall
Concerned itself with me and nothing else at all

Yesterday the moon was blue
And every crazy day brought something new to do
I used my magic age as if it were a wand
And never saw the waste and emptiness beyond
The game of love I played with arrogance and pride
And every flame I lit too quickly quickly died
The friends I made all seemed somehow to drift away
And only I am left on stage to end the play
There are so many songs in me that won't be sung
I feel the bitter taste of tears upon my tongue
The time has come for me to pay for
Yesterday when I was young...

All the love you promised would be mine forever
I would have bet my bottom dollar on
Well, it sure turned out to be a short forever
Just once I turned my back and you were gone

[Chorus]
From now on all my friends are gonna be strangers
I'm all through ever trusting anyone
The only thing I can count on now is my fingers
I was a fool believing in you and now you are gone

[Verse 2]
It amazes me not knowing any better
Than to think I had a love that could be true
Why, I should be taken out, tarred and feathered
To have let myself be taken in by you

From now on all my friends are gonna be strangers
I'm all through ever trusting anyone
The only thing I can count on now is my fingers
I was a fool believing in you and now you are gone

I've been hurt and I've been scorned at times I've wished I'd never been born
But all of my hard times soon be over all of my hard times soon be over

Been in trouble thrown in jail I had nobody to draw my bail

Of lovin' you today and losin' you tomorrow
I'd warn him, but he'd call it jealousy
So let him be another, then another

You'll go anywhere for a brand new love affair
Somebody new who thrills you instantly
But when the thrill has ceased to chill
And from your past, I know it will
There'll always be another, then another
And another just like me

It hurts to love so much and not be loved at all
But I'd rather loan you out than let you go

My dreams are gone but I still want you so and I'd rather loan you out than let you go

At least I'll always know that you'll love me once

If things with us can never be the way they were
Then I'd rather loan you out than let you go

If the whole world stopped lovin' the way you stopped lovin' me
Have you ever stopped to wonder what kind of place this would be

And the whole world stopped lovin' how long would living go on
Hear the church bells in the steeple as they ring their song through the air
If the whole world stopped lovin' there'd be no steeple bells there

Roy Drusky,Jody And The Kid,1968-07-22,1968-09-23,"

She would meet me in the morning on my way down to the river
Waitin' patient by the chinaberry tree
With her feet already dusty from the pathway to the levee
And her little blue jeans rolled up to her knees
And I'd paid her no attention as she tagged along beside me
Trying hard to copy everything I did
But I couldn't keep from smiling when I'd hear somebody saying
Looky yonder there goes Jody and the kid

Even after we grew older we could still be seen together
As we walked along the levee holding hands
For as surely as the seasons she was changing to a woman
And I'd lived enough to call myself a man
And she often lay beside me in the coolness of the evening
Till the morning sun was shining on my bed
And at times when she was sleeping I would smile when I'd remember
How they used to call us Jody and the kid

Now the world's a little older and the years have changed the river
Cause there's houses where they didn't used to be
And on Sundays I go walking down the pathway to the levee
With another little girl who follows me
And it makes the old folks smile to see her tag along beside me
Doin' little things the way her mama did
But it gets a little lonesome when I hear somebody saying
Looky yonder there goes Jody and the kid

I've been up and I've been down I've worked the fields I've plowed the ground
I've taken strain and pressure till I thought I might explode
Now I yearn for childhood days of model planes and lemonade
When the day stretched out before me like a long long Texas road
Yes a long long Texas road bout a million miles or so
When you're just a child there ain't no time but now
Must have left that long old road seven hundred years ago
And I'd find it once again if I knew how

I've worked in city factories their plastic dirt still clings to me
Monotory near killed me Lord it was a heavy load
Now I dream of comic books and horny toads and fishin' hooks
When the day stretched out before me like a long long Texas road
Yes a long long Texas road...

So I watch the children play and dream my dreams of yesterday
Don't tell them to be grateful I'm sure that they've been told
If I knew then what I know now that would have messed it up somehow
When the day stretched out before me like a long long Texas road
Yes a long long Texas road...

The things I done wrong
And some things I didn't do
That I sure wish I had
You know I'd give anything
To have things like they used to be

So darling
Search your heart again
I know there must be some love left for me
Come on back to me
And let's try again
Cause I'll be forever loving you

You swear to tell the truth
The whole truth
And nothing but the truth
So help you God
Yes, I do

Judge, I've never believed in divorces
Unless they just have to be
But after you've heard my story
Then I know you'll set this man free

It began right after the wedding
She cheated and she lied
Right from the start
And I could see from the way they were headed
This woman would soon break his heart

Set him free
Set him free
For I love him, you see

The three of us were always best of friends
But when I leave this courtroom, judge
I know our friendship ends
If you could have heard the awful things I've heard her say
While she called him names and slapped his face
And he'd just turn away

And the nights we went out for fun
It was also plain to see then
She danced all night with someone else
And leaved him there with me

Set him free
Set him free
For I love him, you see

Now I ask you, judge to understand
Think it over slowly
You see
I fell in love with
And I dont care who knows
I respect him as a husband
And I treat him like a man
I know I could help him find more happiness than this woman ever can

Well, Judge, you've heard my story
It's as true as true can be
I've even told you that I love him
So Judge, won't you please set him free?

Set him free
Set him free
For I love him, you see

You've got a plan in mind
To make things come your way
I wonder if it's worth the price you have to pay
Cause life gets cold and lonely
When your self respect has died
What does it take to keep a man like you satisfied?

You think you need more love than any other man
Someday you'll taste your cup of life
And find it filled with sand
And then you'll have to turn and face the man within
For where I stand
I don't think you'll be proud of where you've been

And when you're running from yourself
There's just no place to hide
What does it take to keep a man like you satisfied?

Stonewall Jackson,B.J. The D.J.,1963-12-02,1964-04-27,"

A story bout a pal of mine who worked down near the Georgia Line
A DJ in a little country station

Everybody loved him dear cause he played what they liked to hear
He built himself a quite a reputation

At record hops he stayed out late and his mom would always wait
To see if he had made it home alive

She warned against his loss of sleep and driving fast in that old heap
And that he had to be at work by five

BJ the DJ you're living much too fast
And if you don't change your ways don't see how you can last

Every morning just past four from the driveway he would roar
Overslept and he was late again

Then at breakneck speed he'd drive to sign the station on at five
He had lots of records he must spin

His mom said by the radio until his voice told her hello
She knew then that he made it there alright

Then she'd say a little prayer, giving thanks that he was there. And she'd wait up for him again tonight

Then one cold and rainy morn all the tires were badly worn
But still he screeched off just as fast this time

BJ had a lot of nerve but he completely missed the curve
And he signed off down near the Georgia Line

Mom sat by the radio the voice she heard she didn't know
BJ'd never been this late before

But with the road so bad and all she'd wait a while before she called
And then she heard the knock upon the door

BJ the DJ only twenty four a wreck at ninety miles an hour he'll spin the discs no more

Stonewall Jackson,I Washed My Hands In Muddy Water,1965-02-22,1965-06-28,"

I was born in Macon, Georgia
They kept my dad in the Macon jail
Dad said 'Son, if you keep your hands clean -
You won't hear them bloodhounds on your trail
But I fell in with bad companions
We robbed a man in Tennessee
The sheriff caught me
Way up in Nashville
They locked me up and threw away the key

I washed my hands in muddy water
Washed my hands but they didn't come clean
Tried to do like daddy like told me
But I must have washed my hands in a muddy stream

I asked the jailor ""When's my time up?""
He said 'Son, we won't forget
And if you try to keep your hands clean
We may make a good man of you yet'
I couldn't wait to do my sentence
Broke out of the Nashville jail
I just crossed the line of Georgia and I can hear them bloodhounds on my trail
I washed my hands...

Stonewall Jackson,If This House Could Talk,1965-11-22,1966-02-07,"

If this house could talk oh what a story although it's only made of wood and stone
How it could brag about its days of glory when it almost became a happy home

I just came back in town to sign the papers the house is sold now it's no longer mine
And since the place I built for you once meant so much to me
Thought I'd drop by and see it one more time
I parked the car got out and looked it over
The unkept lawn now seemed so strange to me
That rambling rose that I'd set out with tender care had died
And weeds grow now where flowers used to be
I walked up close looked through the picture window
The past was oh so clear as I looked through
I listened close and almost heard those tender words of love
As I sat by the fireside with you
If this house could talk...

Leona Leona you tell him you're through you tell him Leona about me and you
You tell him we're married with a baby up to
You tell him Leona you tell him you're true
You laughed as I pleaded and walked out the door
To meet him to kiss him to shame me once more
I knew where to find you just follow the sign dancing and dining coctails and wine
[ steel ]
The sidewalk was crowded in front of the bar I heard the sirenes of black police car
Two bodies lay crumbled a woman a man
His wife stood there by you a gun in her hand
Leona Leona it's over and through the baby is crying and calling for you
For me there's no difference I knew for so long
That some day you'd leave me and now you are gone

Stonewall Jackson,Life Of A Poor Boy,1960-04-25,1960-05-23,"

When I Was Just A Youngster And Hardly In My Teens
I Went To School On Many A Day With Faded Old Blue Jeans
The Patches They Were Many The Seat Was All Thread Bare
But A Poor Girl Didn't Notice And A Poor Boy Didn't Care

Chorus

A Poor Boy Don't Have No Money A Poor Boy Don't Have No Dough
Give A Poor Boy A Pretty Little Girl And Watch That Poor Boy Go
He's The Backbone Of The Nation The Pappy Of The Land
With A Two Buck Loan He'll Build Him Home
And Raise Him A Poor Boy Clan

His Worries They Are Many His Pleasures Are But Few
But That Don't Worry A Poor Boy His Pappy Had 'Em Too
His Livin' Don't Come Easy He Has To Sweat It Out
But He'd Rather Be A Poor Boy Than A Wealty Gad-a-bout

Chorus

A Poor Boy Don't Have No Money A Poor Boy Don't Have No Dough
Give A Poor Boy A Pretty Little Girl And Watch That Poor Boy Go
He's The Backbone Of The Nation The Pappy Of The Land
With A Two Buck Loan He'll Build Him Home
And Raise Him A Poor Boy Clan

If It Wasn't For The Poor Boy A Lot Would Go Un-done
The Plough Would Never Furrow Or The Mill Would Never Run
There Wouldn't Be No Taters There Wouldn't Be No Beans
The Rich Would All Be Poor Boys In Faded Old Blue Jeans

Chorus

A Poor Boy Don't Have No Money A Poor Boy Don't Have No Dough
Give A Poor Boy A Pretty Little Girl And Watch That Poor Boy Go
He's The Backbone Of The Nation The Pappy Of The Land
With A Two Buck Loan He'll Build Him Home

Stonewall Jackson,Life To Go,1958-11-03,1959-04-06,"

I've got a sad sad story friend that I don't like to tell
I had a home and fam'ly when they locked me in this cell
I've been in here eighteen years a long long time I know
But time don't mean a thing to me cause I've got life to go
Well I went one night where the lights were bright just to see what I could see
I met up with the old friend who just thought the world of me
Well he brought me drinks and he took me to every honky tonk in town
Then words were said and now he's dead I just had to bring him down
Well it's been a long long time now since I've heard from my wife
I know I'd be there with her yet if I hadn't used the knife
Well I'll bet that little girl of mine don't realize or know
Her daddy's been here eighteen years and still got life to go
Well I'll bet there's not one man outside that's spent this long in jail
I'll be here in this prison till my body's just a shell
No I can't be free to go and see the ones that I love so
I've been in here eighteen years I've still got life to go
Yes I've still got life to go oh I've still got life to go

Oh Mary don't you weep for me
Oh Mary just you wait for me
The battle will soon be over
Oh Mary don't you weep

Jimmy sent a letter to his bride back home
For three long years now he's been gone
He left her cryin' on her wedding day
And went to fight the battle of the Blue and Gray

Oh Mary don't you weep for me
Oh Mary just you wait for me
The war's gonna soon be over
Oh Mary don't you weep

Mary's young heart was filled with joy
When she got the letter from her soldier boy
His words of love made her heart beat fast
But little did she know it would be the last

Oh Mary don't you weep for me
Oh Mary just you wait for me
The battle will soon be over
Oh Mary don't you weep

On that same day Atlanta burned down
Her soldier boy he fell to the ground
Now Mary sits alone by the candle light
And reads his letter over every night

Oh Mary don't you weep for me
Oh Mary just you wait for me
The war's gonna soon be over
Oh Mary don't you weep

Oh Mary don't you weep for me
Oh Mary just you wait for me
The battle's gonna soon be over

I remember to this day the bright red Georgia clay
And how it stuck to the tires after the summer rain
Will power made that old car go my roamin' mind told me that's so
How I wish that we were back on the road again
Me and you and a dog named Boo travelin' and a livin' off the land
Me and you and a dog named Boo how I love being a free man

I can still recall the wheatfields near St Paul
And in the mornin' we got caught robbin' from an old hen
Old MacDonald he made us work but then he paid us for what it was worth
Another tank of gas and back on the road again
Me and you and a dog named Boo...

I'll never forget that day we motored stately into big LA
The lights of the city put the settlin' down into my brain
It's only been a month or so that old car's a buggin' us to go
We gotta get away and get back on the road again
Me and you and a dog named Boo...
Me and you and a dog named Boo...

I called the old crowd over as soon as you were gone
My first night here without you couldn't stand to be alone
Their jokes're not really funny but their laughing just the same
They're not my kind of people but I'm so glad they came
I'll be all right as long as I'll keep laughing I'll be all right until this party ends
But when the jokes have all been told and the drinks no longer flows
They'll all go home and I won't smile till they come back again
They're not my kind of people but I'm so glad they came
I guess your friends will tell you how I lived here up tonight
You'll think that I don't miss you you'll be far from being right
They can't help me to forget you but their trying just the same
They're not my kind of people but I'm so glad they came

I've tried everything that I could think of
Went out and bought some things I've wanted to
Spent money for a while like it's going out of style
Nothing takes the place of loving you
I looked for consolation in the barrooms like too many broken hearted do
I drank a full grop down but every night I found
Nothing takes the place of loving you
Nothing takes the place of holding your soft hands in mine
Empty glasses only leave me blue
Where your sweet lips used to be there's just a taste of wine
And nothing takes the place of loving you
[ piano ]
I thought that I could find someone to help me
Now I can't find the girls I've run through
But after every fling I find the same old thing nothing takes the place of loving you
Nothing takes the place of holding...
Nothing takes the place of loving you

I feel the pain and hide the hurt that I go through
I live on dreams my precious dreams that never will come true
How long will I be second choice and love you like I do

One day the train was passin' I caught it crawlin' by
To look this old world over under God's blue sky
My darling stood there weeping as I was looking back
I kissed my baby cryin' in the smoke along the track
Goodbye so long until I come back home you'll be my dream
Goodbye so long there's lots of places that I've never seen
I'll always be a drifter but I'll be driftin' back
To where I left you cryin' in the smoke along the track

I like to keep on goin' it helps me when I'm blue
I get the urge to travel that's all I want to do
I know I just can't settle down because I like to roam
And when I hear that whistle blow I've gotta move along
Goodbye so long there's something down the track keeps calling me
Goodbye so long I guess that's just the way I'll always be
So when I get that feeling don't try to hold me back
I'll only leave you cryin' in the smoke along the track

I know my baby loves me I love my baby too
But she don't understand me when I'm feeling blue
And when I hear that whistle blow I hurry home and pack
And leave my baby cryin' in the smoke along the track
Goodbye so long I hate to leave you but I've gotta go
Goodbye so long it's coming now just heard that whistle blow
It'll be here in a minute you'll wave and I'll look back
I'm gonna leave you cryin' in the smoke along the track

And you'll be with your new love and I'll have to turn away

Happiness is something that we all need plenty of
Starts from deep inside your heart when you've someone to love

Just find someone to live for and to love and then you'll see
Why I've got this happy heart inside of me

Seeking out unwary prey teaching them the way you play the cheating game
Who knows the mind of the cheating kind who's blocked the shadows from sight
Who's gonna pay the price to make the wrong seem right
You're gonna go act free to live a life without a blame
While I reap the harvest of heartaches from the cheating game

You planted the seed now I must sow my love alone to make it grow
Carrying the only thing you left me a legacy from the cheating game
The web of dreams you weave so well was casting to die for my private hell
Taking love forsaking love making me a viction of the cheating game
Who knows the mind of the cheating kind...

Gettin' through these doors that's been so slow

Call his kids while trying to get back home
Baggage car goes quickly by see my face and start to cry
Stumble to the lounge to be alone
And while I'm trying to get some rest I bite my lips and try my best
To fight the pain that's making me leave home

With silver wings across the sky paper trails and wave goodbye
To those below who've got to stay at home
I wish that I had flown at night so I could take that champagne flight
Rid myself of every tear I own

Captain's voice so load and clear amplifies into my ear
Insuring me and flying friendly skies

Tammy Wynette,'Til I Get It Right,1973-01-08,1973-04-02,"

I'll just keep on falling in love till I get it right
Right now I'm like a wounded bird hungry for the sky
But if I try my wings and try long enough I'm bound to learn to fly
So I'll just keep on falling in love till I get it right
My door to love has opened up more times than in
I'm either fool or wise enough to open it again
Cause I'll never know what's beyond that mountain till I reach the other side
So I'll just keep on falling in love till I get it right
If practice makes perfect then I'm near bout as perfect as I'll ever be in my life
So I'll just keep on falling in love till I get it right

Tammy Wynette,Another Lonely Song,1974-01-07,1974-04-01,"

Time won't ease my memory it's killing me now
And Lord how I need him here just to feel him near and hear him breathing
Still the night goes on and on another lonely song I'm singing
Lord don't think bad of me don't get mad at me you know I'm weak
And it couldn't cause a whole lot of harm to be in somebody's arms
Cause she's in his I know she is I know she is but God I love him
And though I shouldn't give a damn that's the way I am now
And Lord guess I'll stay this way I can't play this way just because I'm lonely
Still the night goes on and on another lonely song I'm singing
Lord don't look down on me don't frown on me let's just keep talking

Just follow the stairway
To this lonely world of mine
You'll find me waitin' here
In apartment number 9

You walked away from me
And after the all the plans we made
You decided to be free

Loneliness surrounds me
Without your arms around me
And the sun will never shine
In apartment number 9

I keep waiting in this lonely room
Just in case you change your mind
You'll find me waitin' here
In apartment number 9

Loneliness surrounds me
Without your arms around me
And the sun will never shine

Tammy Wynette,Bedtime Story,1972-01-03,1972-03-27,"

I've told you almost ev'ry bedtime story
And you've heard almost ev'ry nursery rhyme
So, tonight before you go to sleep
And pray the Lord your soul to keep
Here's mommy's favorite story one more time

Once upon a time there was a castle
And in this castle lived a King and Queen
And it came to pass, they were both were blessed
By one little blue-eyed princess
With the softest golden curls you've ever seen

But then one day, he met this pretty lady
And she had lots of pretty words to say
And this part makes your mommy sad
'Cause,oh, what big eyes she had
And she took his hand and led him far away

Still, it's just another bedtime story
But tellin' it brings teardrops to my eyes
Just another pretty bedtime story
So, please forgive mommy if she cries

Then it came to pass, the King grew lonely
And the pretty lady wasn't all she seemed
He realized that he was wrong
And started his long journey home
For he misses little Princess and his Queen

Then he was back and safe inside his castle
And tears of joy came pourin' down like rain
Then the castle rang with laughter
They lived happy ever after
Knowin' he would never leave again

Still, it's just another bedtime story
But tellin' it brings teardrops to my eyes
Just another pretty bedtime story
So, please forgive mommy if she cries

Won't you please forgive your mommy
If she cries

Tear the heart right out of me

Watch him smile, he thinks it Christmas
Or his 5th Birthday
And he thinks C-U-S-T-O-D-Y spells fun or play

Good lovin' keeps a home together good lovin' sure can make it right
If you ever wanna be without him it means lovin' everything about him
That keeps your man around you tight

It takes a whole lotta women to hold it together today
Cause a lot of other women have a whiole lotta time to play
You gotta be saint on Sunday morning a devil on Saturday night
And when you love him do it right
Cause she's around at corner a wrapped in fur
And you've got to be just a little bit better than her
A little bit sweeter with morning kisses a whole lot warmer in the night
With a whole lotta good lovin' to make everything alright
Good lovin' keeps a home together...

If you don't believe what I'm tellin' you is so
Put your man right down the street and watch him go
Right to the arms of a woman who couldn't even hold you a light
When a lotta good lovin' would've made everything alright
If you don't believe...
Yeah a lotta good lovin' would've made everything alright

Today I sat alone at the window
And I watched our little girl outside at play
With the little boy next door like so many times before
But something didn't seem quite right today

So I went outside to see what they were doing
And then the teardrops made my eyes grow dim
'Cause I heard him name a game and I hung my head in shame
When I heard our little girl say to him

I don't wanna play house; I know it can't be fun
I've watched mommy and daddy
And if that's the way it's done
I don't wanna play house; It makes my mommy cry
'Cause when she played house
My daddy said good-bye

I don't wanna play house; I know it can't be fun

Sometimes, I wonder if he loves me like he used to
So many things bring doubt to my mind
It's only natural for a woman to sit and worry
And search for all the faults, she can find

Last night I waited up, it seemed forever
And I'm not even sure when he came in
To make things worse he never tried to wake me
And offered no excuse for where he'd been

But I'll see him through
For better, for worse, Lord knows it's true
'Cause I love him, I'll see him through
He gave me love when I needed it bad
He was the only thing on earth that I had
And that's the reason that I'll see him through

I'll see him through
He gave me love when I needed it bad

And when he said how i make him glad and i'm his shelter from the storm
I'm his song when he feels like singin
And i swing when he feels like swingin
I don't know what i'd do that's right but it makes him come home at night

There are so many ways to love a man and so many things to understand
And if there ever comes a time you decide to change your mind
I'll need a way to hold you and I can cause I'll know all the ways to love a man
But there's so many ways to lose a man so quickly he can slip through your hands
One little thing goes wrong then all at once he's gone
I'd have no way to hold him like I planned

Tammy Wynette,The Wonders You Perform,1970-11-30,1971-02-15,"

Oh Lord, you know that I'm not one to bother you with little things
And you and I have never been too close
But we've always been on speakin' terms
I've watched you with doin' things
And tried to understand you more than most

No I haven't gone to church the way I ought to
But I always thought you knew in my own way I worshiped you
While even your own children doubt and fail to understand
The simple way you go about the things you do

I've seen the doubt upon the face of loved ones
As they sadly placed a wreath of flowers on a tiny grave
And wondered why a child is brought into the world
To only live a little while and die, you could have saved

But I believe that in your eyes this little child was something special
And you wanted it to be with you, no doubt
So with out-stretched arms you beckoned it so simple that I reckon
They can't understand the way you worked it out

Once I saw a young man growin' till he neared the age of knowing
Then I watched as somethin' happened to his mind
No doctor could correct it, it was just as I suspected
And I marveled at your way of bein' kind

They tried everything in vain and I was there when they explained it
To the family, how he slipped into a trance
Guess you looked into the future, watched him turn his back upon you
Lovin' him so much you couldn't take the chance

It took a lot of love to die, for sinners such as I
And I guess that's why you've never given up on me
You understood when some denied you and even when they crucified you
Knowin' all these things were meant to be

For the stable's such a simple thing, no wonder there were few who came
To see a king the night that

And when I finally close my eyes the sun is high

But when we forget compassion and to forgive is too old fashioned
We've let everything worth having pass us by

Asking about a rose

People never took the time
To mind the young man`s questions
Until one day
They heard him ask a little green eyed girl

Twenty some odd years ago
A drunk down in Memphis
Lost a month of life and labor to the county jail

Just because he asked
A little green eyed girl a question
And offered her a nickel`s worth of candy
If she`d tell

A year and some odd days ago
An old man died in Memphis
Just another wayward soul the county had to claim

Inside the old man`s ragged coat
They found a faded letter
It said you have a daughter
And her eyes are Wilson green

I'll walk just beyond the moon then I'll stop and wait for you

My mother and my father were in love for 50 years
So when dad died we wondered why my mother shed no tears
We asked her once about it but she wouldn't tell us why
Instead she'd walk outside each night and smile up at the sky
Then just before she left us she called us to her side
She told us what my father said to her just before he died

I remember when you said you'd never leave me
Through these golden years i've kept the same vow too
But now that I am going please don't leave me
I'll walk just beyond the moon then I'll stop and wait for you

You can look up every night and you'll see me light the light
Where I'll watch for you to join me someday soon
We'll go lookin through the stars for the heaven that is ours
And I know we'll find it soon somewhere just beyond the moon

I'll walk just beyond the moon then I'll stop and wait for you

I'll just sit there by a star and I'll watch you from afar
Til I see you walking toward me someday soon
Then together hand in hand we'll find our promised land
And we'll settle down forever darlin' just beyond the moon

I'll walk just beyond the moon then I'll stop and wait for you

Oh, please don't be so careless with your glances
Don't look at me that way and breathe a sigh
And please don't get too close and let me love you
'Cause I'd just be fool enough to try

It's not that I don't think I'm worthy of you
But mem'ries from the past I still recall
Don't let me hold you in my arms and kiss you
'Cause I'd just be fool enough to fall

Don't let me tell you how I've dreamed about you
And longed to have a love that I could share
And please don't let your eyes be so revealing
'Cause I'd just be fool enough to care

It's not that I don't think I'm worthy of you
But mem'ries from the past I still recall
Don't let me hold you in my arms and kiss you

I peeked in to say goodnight
When I heard my child in prayer
Send dear God, some scarlet ribbons
Scarlet ribbons for my hair

All the stores were closed and shuttered
All the streets were dark and bare
In our town no scarlet ribbons
Not one ribbon for her hair

Through the night my heart was aching
Just before the dawn was breaking
I peeked in and on her bed
In gay profusion laying there
I saw ribbonsm scarlet ribbons
Scarlet ribbons for her hair

If I live to be a hundred
I will never know from where
Came those lovely scarlet ribbons
Scarlet ribbons for her hair...

The Browns,The Three Bells,1959-08-03,1959-12-07,"

There's a village, hidden deep in the valley
Among the pine trees, half forlorn
And there, on a sunny morning
Little Jimmy Brown was born

All the chapel bells were ringing
In the little valley town
And the song that they were singing
Was for baby Jimmy Brown

Then the little congregation
Prayed for guidance from above
""Lead us not into temptation
Bless this hour of meditation
Guide him with eternal love.""

There's a village, hidden deep in the valley
Beneath the mountains high above
And there, twenty years thereafter
Jimmy was to meet his love

All the chapel bells were ringing
'Twas a great day in his life
Cause the song that they were singing
Was for Jimmy and his wife

Then the little congregation
Prayed for guidance from above
""Lead us not into temptation
Bless, O Lord, this celebration
May their lives be filled with love.""

From the village, hidden deep in the valley
One rainy morning dark and gray
A soul winged its way to Heaven
Jimmy Brown had passed away

Just one lonely bell was ringing
In the little valley town
'Twas farewell that it was singing
To our dear old Jimmy Brown

And the little congregation
Prayed for guidance from above
""Lead us not into temptation
May his soul find the salvation
Of thy great eternal love.""

If there's water in the desert sand out in the sea
If you were not an angel sweet as you could be
You could turn the night today make all my dreams come true
Say how far it is to heaven then I'll stop loving you
If the earth is up above us stars are down below
If there are daisies in the desert roses in the snow
If today can be tomorrow if old things can be new
If you can live without a heartbeat then I'll stop loving you

The Country Gentlemen,Bringing Mary Home,1965-10-25,1965-11-15,"

I was driving down a lonely road one dark and stormy night
When a little girl by the roadside showed up in my headlights
I stopped and she got in back and in a shaky tone
She said: My name is Mary, please won't you take me home?

She must have been so frightened all alone there in the night
There was something strange about her, for her face was deathly white
She sat so pale and quiet in the back seat all alone
I'll never will forget that night I took Mary home

I pulled into the driveway where she told me to go
Got out to help her from the car and opened up the door
But I just could not believe my eyes 'cause the back seat was bare
I looked all around the car but Mary wasn't there

A light shone from the porch, someone opened up the door
I asked about the little girl that I was looking for
Then a lady gently smiled and brushed a tear away
She said: It sure was nice of you to go out of your way

But thirteen years ago today a wreck just down the road
Our darling Mary lost her life and we miss her so
Thank you for your trouble and the kindness you have shone
You're the thirteenth one who's been here bringing Mary home

(Oooooooooo)
On a weekend pass I wouldn't have had time
To get home and marry, that baby of mine
So I went to the Chaplain and he authorized
Me to send for my Ebony Eyes

My Ebony Eyes was coming to me
From out of the skies on Flight 1203
In an hour or two, I would whisper ""I do""
To my beautiful Ebony Eyes

Spoken:
The plane was way overdue
So I went inside to the airline's desk and I said:
""Sir, I wonder why 1203 is so late""
He said: ""Oh they probably took off late
Or they may have run into some turbulent weather and had to alter the course""

I went back outside and waited at the gate
And I watched the beacon light from the control tower
As it whipped through the dark ebony skies if it were searching for 
My Ebony Eyes

And then came the announcement over the loudspeaker
""Would those having relatives or friends on Flight number 1203
Please report to the chapel across the street at once""

Then I felt a burning break deep inside
And I knew the heavenly ebony skies
Had taken my life's most wonderful prize
My beautiful Ebony Eyes

If I ever get, to heaven I'll bet
The first angel I'll recognise
She'll smile at me and I know she will be
My beautiful Ebony Eyes

She speaks with the voice of an angel she smiles a heavenly smile
Soft as the warm winds of April and pure as the heart of child
But that's just one of the moods of Mary one of her faces that I see
I know about the moods of Mary cause one of her moods is me

Mary will lie and decive me she can be fickle and cold
She'll offer her lips just to tease me and then give me heartaches untold
But that's just one of the moods of Mary part of her personality
I don't mind the moods of Mary when Mary's in the mood for me

Mary can change like the seasons she can be tender and kind
Then she hurts me without any reason and drives me out of my mind
But I can live with the moods of Mary if that's the way it has to be
I forget the other moods of Mary when Mary's in the mood for me

I met a little girl in Knoxville, a town we all know well
And every Sunday evening, out in her home I'd dwell
We went to take an evening walk about a mile from town
I picked a stick up off the ground and knocked that fair girl down

She fell down on her bended knees for mercy she did cry
Oh Willie dear don't kill me here, I'm unprepared to die
She never spoke another word, I only beat her more
Until the ground around me within her blood did flow

I took her by her golden curls and I drug her round and around
Throwing her into the river that flows through Knoxville town
Go down, go down, you Knoxville girl with the dark and rolling eyes
Go down, go down, you Knoxville girl, you can never be my bride

I started back to Knoxville, got there about midnight
My Mother she was worried and woke up in a fright
Saying ""Dear son, what have you done to bloody your clothes so?""
I told my anxious Mother, I was bleeding at my nose

I called for me a candle to light myself to bed
I called for me a hankerchief to bind my aching head
Rolled and tumbled the whole night throught, as troubles was for me
Like flames of hell around my bed and in my eyes could see

They carried me down to Knoxville and put me in a cell
My friends all tried to get me out but none could go my bail
I'm here to waste my life away down in this dirty old jail
Because I murdered that Knoxville girl, the girl I loved so well

Who was spoken to in town by very few

And here's one I caught of you when you weren't ready
And here I am when I was just a kid
Oh sweetheart it's so much fun to be reminded
Of how we used to look and what we used to do
And each time we make a memory I'm reminded
I can't picture me with no one else but you

Here's a pose of you that looked so sweet and lovely
That's the way I pictured you right from the start
And here's a picture of you being close beside me
That's the picture that I carry in my heart
Oh sweetheart it's so much fun...

Who always cooked my steaks and cooked 'em rare Ruth
When the chips were down who was always there Ruth
And to whom did I swear up and down I'd always tell the truth
E-del-o-da-la-de who in the world but Ruth
But now I'm as ruthless as can be ruthless since Ruth walked out to me
Now I had hopes that someday old Ruth would be my wife
But it looks like I'll be ruthless all my life
( whistle )
Who always made my world so bright and cheery ol' Ruth
Who always rubbed my back when I was weary sweet Ruth
Who used to call me every day from a telephone booth
E-del-o-da-la-de who in the world but Ruth
But now I'm as ruthless as can be ruthless since Ruth walked out to me
I used to think that me and Ruth would share a happy home
But it looks like I'll be ruthless from now on

Holdin' you my spirits go up high
But I've got a lot to learn
Lovin' you is playing with fire
And I might get my fingers burned

If I'm not the right one for you, baby
Don't keep me in the cloud too long
But try to let me down, kind of easy
When the right one comes along

Kissin' you is askin' for trouble
I might find my trouble soon
Lovin' you is courtin' destruction
Like playin' games with my own due

If I'm not the right one for you, baby
Don't let me build my home too strong
But try to break it to me gently
When the right one comes along
When the right one comes along

The Statler Brothers,Whatever Happened To Randolph Scott,1974-01-28,1974-03-18,"

Everybody knows when you go to the show you can't take the kids along
You've gotta read the paper and know the code of GPG and R and X
And you gotta know what the movie's about before you even go
Tex Ritter's gone and Disney's dead and the screen is filled with sex
Whatever happened to Randolph Scott ridin' the train alone
Whatever happened to Gene and Tex and Roy and Rex the Durango Kid
Oh whatever happened to Randolph Scott his horse plain as could be
Whatever happened to Randolph Scott has happened to the best of me
( guitar )
Everybody's tryin' to make a comment about our doubts and fears
True Grit's the only movie I've really understood in years
You gotta take your analyst along to see if it's fit to see
Whatever happened to Randolph Scott has happened to the industry
Whatever happened to Johnny Mack Brown and Alan Rocky Lane
Whatever happened to Lash LaRue I'd love to see them again
Whatever happened to Smiley Burnette Tim Holt and Gene Autry
Whatever happened to all of these has happened to the best of me
Whatever happened to Randolph Scott has happened to the industry

She was young and I was older she believed everything I told her
She gave her heart and soul to me and more I wanted
She left home and gave her life to me alone and I had no right to
Treat her like I treated those before but she loved it and wanted more
Sometimes I lied to make her happy
Sometimes she'd lie to see if I would lie some more
( piano )
I hear now she's a mother North Carolina with her lover
And I'll bet she daily causses me and she's got reason for it
But I hope life there is better but I hope he don't let her
Have too much time to spend alone cause she's a woman without a home

Roy taught me how to play baseball and do the foxtrot on the harp
Taught me how to swim and fish and tell the difference between bass and carp
Taught me how to snap my fingers whistle through my teeth oh Uncle Roy
He sure took time to make times good for a little pesty half grown boy
Aunt Kathleen would wash my clothes and blow my nose whenever nature called
Darn my socks and damn the pox but kept me out of school from fall to fall
Gave me movie money though I never did my chores the way I should
To a nasty little nephew Kathleen you sure made aunthood awful good
And Freddy used to laughed to me whenever something valuable got broke
He taught me how to climb a tree about birds and bees and taught me how to smoke
He took me on a first date I was scared to death but he said you'll do fine
Good buddy you're my cousin but you seem more like a brother of mine
But you can't go home to the good times you can't go home anymore
Roy's all crippled up now Kathleen can hardly see
Freddy's off somewhere to fight a war
But you can't go home to the good times you can't go home anymore
Everything has changed and who were there to blame
Gone far that you just can't go home

Looking back I'd say I had the best childhood that money just can't buy
And I owe it all to free good folks who took me in when mom began to die
They always told me son just do what's right and you'll be proud just wait and see
Well Roy and Kathleen I'm only proud that you're the ones who's proud of me

WRITERS BOBBY BRADDOCK, CURLY PUTMAN

Well, we went out on a double date
Me and Edith, you and Kate
Before we got past their front gate
There you were making eyes at Edith
While you were making time with Kate

You can't have your Kate and Edith too
You rascal you yodel-a-dio

Then we went to a drive in a show
You were kissing on Kate, she wouldn't let you go
I looked at Edith started feeling bold
I found your big hairy hand holding on
To the hand I was trying to hold

You can't have your Kate and Edith too

Get her some popcorn, I said I would
When I got back dad-blame if you
Hadn't crawled into the backseat with

You can't have your Kate and Edith too
You rascal you yodel-a-dio

Years have passed since that first date

And you and Edith are in the house alone

[Verse:]
""How old do you think I am?"" he said
I said, Well, I didn't know
He said, ""I turned 65 about 11 months ago""
I was sittin' in Miami pourin' blended whiskey down
When this old gray black gentleman was cleanin' up the lounge
There wasn't anyone around 'cept this old man and me
The guy who ran the bar was watchin' 'Ironsides' on TV
Uninvited, he sat down and opened up his mind
On old dogs and children and watermelon wine
""Ever had a drink of watermelon wine?"" he asked
He told me all about it, though I didn't answer back
""Ain't but three things in this world that's worth a solitary dime
But old dogs and children and watermelon wine""
He said, ""Women think about theyselves, when menfolk ain't around
And friends are hard to find when they discover that you're down""
He said, ""I tried it all when I was young and in my natural prime
Now it's old dogs and children and watermelon wine""
Old dogs care about you even when you make mistakes
God bless little children while they're still too young to hate
When he moved away I found my pen and copied down that line
'Bout old dogs and children and watermelon wine
I had to catch a plane up to Atlanta that next day
As I left for my room I saw him pickin' up my change
That night I dreamed in peaceful sleep of shady summertime
Of old dogs and children and watermelon wine

Tom T. Hall,A Week In A Country Jail,1969-12-15,1970-03-23,"

[Verse:]
One time I spent a week inside a little country jail
And I don't guess I'll ever live it down
I was sittin' at a red light when these two men came and got me
And said that I was speeding through their town
Well, they said,tomorrow morning you can see the judge then go
They let me call one person on the phone
I thought I'd be there overnight so I just called my boss
To tell him I'd be off but not for long
Well, they motioned me inside a cell with seven other guys
One little barred up window in the rear
My cellmates said if they had let me bring some money in
We ought to send the jailer for some beer
Well, I had to pay him double 'cause he was the man in charge
And the jailer's job was not the best in town
Later on his wife brought hot bologna, eggs and gravy
The first day I was there I turned it down
Well, next morning they just let us sleep but I was up real early
Wonderin' when I'd get my release
Later on we got more hot bologna, eggs and gravy
And by now I wasn't quite so hard to please
Two days later when I thought that I had been forgotten
The sheriff came in chewin' on a straw
He said, where is the guy who thinks that this is indianapolis?
I'd like to talk to him about the law
Well, I told him who I was and told him I was working steady
And I really should be gettin' on my way
That part about me bein' who I was did not impress him
He said, the judge'll be here any day
The jailer had a wife and let me tell you she was awful
But she brought that hot bologna every day
And after seven days she got to lookin' so much better
I asked her if she'd like to run away
The next mornin' that old judge took every nickel that I had
And he said, son, let this teach you not to race
The jailer's wife was smilin' from the window as I left
In thirty minutes I was out of state

Tom T. Hall,Ballad Of Forty Dollars,1968-11-18,1969-03-10,"

The man who preached the funeral
Said it really was a simple way to die
He laid down to rest one afternoon
And never opened up his eyes

They hired me and Fred and Joe
To dig the grave and carry up some chairs
It took us seven hours
And I guess we must've drunk a case of beer

I guess I ought to go and watch them put him down
But I don't own a suit
And anyway when they start talkin' about
The fire in Hell, well, I get spooked

So, I'll just sit here in my truck
And act like I don't know him when they pass
Anyway, when they're all through
I've got to go to work and mow the grass

Well, here they come and who's that
Ridin' in that big ol' shiny limousine
Look at all that chrome, I do believe
That that's the sharpest thing I've seen

That must belong to his great uncle
Someone said he owned a big ol' farm
When they get parked I'll mosey down
And look it over, that won't do no harm

Well, that must be the widow in the car
And would you take a look at that
That sure is a pretty dress
You know, some women do look good in black

Well, he's not even in the ground
And they say that his truck is up for sale
They say she took it pretty hard
But you can't tell too much behind the veil

Well, listen, ain't that pretty
When the bugler plays the Military Taps
I think that when you's in the war
They always hide 'n play a song like that

Well, here I am and there they go
And I guess you'd just call it my bad luck
I hope he rests in peace, the trouble is
The fellow owes me forty bucks

To let you know that I was coming home

I didn't realize you had a phone

Told me that his wife is awful sick
You heard my record on the radio
Oh, well it's just another song
But I've got a hit recorded
And it'll be out on the market 'fore too long
I got this ring in mexico
No, it didn't cost me quite a bunch
When you're in the business that I'm in
The people call it puttin' up a front
I know I've lost a little weight
I guess I am looking kind of pale
If you didn't know me better, dad
You'd think that I'd just gotten out of jail
No, we don't ever call them beer joints
Night clubs are the places that I work
You meet a lot of people there, but no
There ain't much chance of gettin' hurt
I'm sorry that I couldn't be there with you
All when momma passed away
I was on the road and when they came
And told me it was just too late
I drove by the grave to see her, boy
That really is a pretty stone
I'm glad that fred and jan are here
It's better than you being here alone
Well I knew you's gonna ask me
Who the lady is that's sleeping in the car
That's just a girl who works for me
And, man, she plays a pretty mean guitar
We worked in San Antone last night
She didn't even have the time to dress
She drove me down from nashville and
To tell the truth I guess she needs the rest
Well, dad, I gotta go
We got a dance to work in cartersville tonight
Let me take your number down
I'll call you, and I promise you I'll write
Now you be good and don't be chasin'
All those pretty women that you know
And by the way if you see barbara walker
Tell her that I said ""hello.""

Tom T. Hall,More About John Henry,1972-10-16,1972-11-27,"

(The Storytellers and I were doin' a show down in Meridian, Mississippii
And these friends of mine came up
And brought me this real old book about John Henry
And they told me if they let me read this old book I'd probably write a song about it
And they did and I did and I called it More About John Henry)

First of all John Henry was a black man he was born where the sun don't ever shine
He was six feet tall he didn't know his own strength
But he did not swing the hammer all the time
Of course he didn't John Henry had some women on his mind
There was a woman cross the street named Poor Selma
Loved John Henry like a natural man
John Henry quit Poor Selma just like he was quittin' work
He loved that stinger-ree of Julie Anne
And what is it a stinger-ree is somethin' else you understand
There was a man named Stacker Lee in Argenta a little man with a big 44
You know he shot his woman down and took a shot at Poor Selma
But ol' Stacker won't be shootin' anymore
He had to quit it John Henry laid him dead on the floor
John Henry threw Stacker Lee in the river then he said I've got a say so to say
He broke out in a song that was wrote by Blind Leonard
He said Julie Anne I'm singing my say
He said I love you but I do not like your lowdown ways
Well John Henry went to a conjurin' woman said this misery ain't no way to live
Somebody's back door creeping on my pretty Julie Anne
Conjure woman had a say so to give
She said John Henry she said that's just the way things is
Well John Henry went to a hell bustin' man said I'm tormented deep in my soul
Well that hell buster prayed John Henry's sins away
And they tell me that the thunder did roll
Sweet Jesus what a frightenin' sight to behold
From that day on John Henry was a changed man all he did was just work all the time
Well he worked till the muscles in his body gave out
Then he kept right on a workin' in his mind
Don't do it cause a man ain't supposed to work all the time
Julie Anne said John Henry I love you Poor Selma said John Henry you're my man
Ruby said I'm gonna cook ye up some greens and some lean meat
With corn bread in a four foot pan
With lotsa cracklins but John Henry was a diff'rent kinda man
Well they allow that hard work killed John Henry hmm
I'm gonna leave that allowin' up to you hmm
Well was he killed by hard work or was he killed by bad women
Be sure that this ain't happenin' to you
Quit working when your day's work work is through
Cause a man ain't supposed to work all the time
And ain't that just the way the things is
A stinger-ree is somethin' else you understand
Quit working when your your day's work is through God bless you

Tom T. Hall,Ode To A Half A Pound Of Ground Round,1971-04-12,1971-06-07,"

[Verse:]
This is the song about the time
I nearly starved to death in Roanoke Virginia
I woke up Wednesday morning in my little motel bed
Knowing I would die the minute that I move my head
I felt around to make sure I was in my bed alone
I meet some friendly people when I'm stoned
My payday was on Friday I had two more days to go
Even in my agony I knew that I was broke
Lemme pay the check I said and keep the change my friend
She wiggled out of sight with my last ten
At noon I realized there wasn't any way to eat
For lunch I just went out and shuffled up and down the street
At four o'clock I had a funny feeling in my chest
How long's it take to starve a man to death
I found some pennies in my junk and bought a candy bar
Divided it in pieces and I ate one every hour
I just rolled into town and didn't know a single soul
There wasn't any way to make a loan
Thursday morning I was nearly panicked on the job
I heard my stomach growlin' and my head began to throb
I contemplated murder of the folks that brought their lunch
The sudden smell of food would make me jump
Thursday night they run all food commercials on TV
I slept till nine or ten and then I walked the floor to three
Friday morning I looked for some ketchup on my shirts
My mind was gone my legs began to hurt
The last few minutes up to payin' time were all the worst
The minutes were the years it took to build the universe
Finally it came I got my check and made a dash
Yes I said the man will eat at last
Running down the sidewalk I could see the words so sweet
The sign was flashin' on and on Eat Eat Eat
A half o'pound of ground round ma'm and please don't cook it long
The frizzle of the grill was like a song
I've traveled this world over and I ain't been hungry much
I've been down in my thinking and I've been down on my luck
But the sweetest meal I've ever had in anybody's town
Was a half a pound of plain ground round ground round

She was just fourteen, she grew up wild and free
And all the time she'd be waitin' on him

Ravishing Ruby, she sleeps in a bunk out back
Her days and nights were filled
With dreams of a man named Smilin' Jack
That was her daddy's name and that's all she ever knew

Were doin' three years in Germany at the time
We came upon these Frauleins in the bar
Yates said, ""Darf isch zee be-gleit-en?"", they said ""Ya""
And 'Darf isch zee be-gleit-en means?', 'Can we sit with you all?'
Oh we must have drunk ten quarts of German beer
My conscience and my sinuses were clear
I asked that Fraulein if she was a spy
She said, ""Nein but do bis ain bissel high""
A condition not uncommon to the American soldier
Well, later on I went to be excused
When I returned I was a bit confused
Yates and his Fraulein had hit the air
Another guy was sittin' in my chair
A young soldier whom we shall get to know better
I said, ""Excuse me mister that's my seat
I'd like to have it back sir if you please
That girl's a nurse and I've been awful sick""
The man looked up at me and said, ""Mox-nix""
Which means that he was not overly concerned with my health
Next thing I knew he had a switchblade knife
Oh Lord, I didn't know that Fraulein was his wife
I took off through that Gasthaus like a fool
Behind me I heard the crashing stools
As the police would say, he was in hot pursuit
Well, the waitress yelled there's MPs on the way
That's one more reason I didn't want to stay
As I went out the window somethin' went switch
And I giggled all the way home knowin' he missed
At the time it seemed like a laughing matter
But next morning my coat was lyin' there on the bunk
And when I saw that coat it made me jump
That man had cut my coat right down the back
A little bit more and they'd been playin' me taps
And knowin' the sad nature of that song I would decline it
Well, later on I heard that guy got stabbed
They sent him home and didn't that make me glad
On love and marriage I want to say one thing
Oh lady, if you're married wear that ring
And the army has a new policy if you can't move it, paint it
If it has a switchblade knife, salute it
Not necessarily an incident one would want to write mother about
Germany being full of good soldiers and good people

I was there on the day the monkey came into this world
His face was round and reddish and his hair was slightly curled
He didn't look too different from the others I had seen
Who'd-a-thought he was the answer to the nation's dream?
At first he didn't seem to be intelligent at all
Each time he'd start to walk about he'd stumble and he'd fall
My first impression was to be a most mistaken thought
Lord a'mighty, what's this little hairy monkey wrought?
Because I witnessed his departure from his mother's womb
I felt inclined to check his progress every afternoon
One day the keeper of the zoo called in the live TV
Frankly said, ""I think you'll be amazed at what you see""
The monkey walked and talked and waved his arms about his head
In the corner was the stack of books that he had read
""An Educated Monkey!"", said the papers 'cross the land
It was more than weary sociologists could stand
Oh, his fame was universal, he was on the Carson show
People talked about him kindly everywhere he'd go
His insight was amazing, his philosophy was fair
He became a politician welcome everywhere
His wit was not to be compared with any mind intact
He'd lace a phrase with irony and blend it all with fact
Conservatives applauded and the liberals were entranced
The bigots and the integrationists were in his camp
Nobody dared to meet him in an open press debate
He was nominated by the folks from every state
Yes, a monkey was the President, though maybe not the first
And there was peace and harmony throughout the universe
The dream I had last night has been related as it came
As for interpretation, well, it's really very plain
Would you rather have a monkey up in Washington, D.C
Or have those people making monkeys out of you and me?

Tom T. Hall,The Year That Clayton Delaney Died,1971-07-12,1971-11-15,"

[Verse:]
Well I remember the year that Clayton Delaney died
They said for the last two weeks that he suffered and cried
It made a big impression on me although I was a barefoot kid
They said he got religion at the end and I'm glad that he did
Clayton was the best guitar picker in our town
I thought he was a hero and I used to follow Clayton around
I often wondered why Clayton who seemed so good to me
Never took his guitar and made it down in Tennessee
Daddy said he drank a lot but I could never understand
I knew he used to picked up in Ohio with a five piece band
Clayton used to tell me son you better put that old guitar away
There ain't no money in it it'll lead you to an early grave
I guess if I'd admit it Clayton taught me how to drink booze
I can see him half stoned pickin` up the Lovesick Blues
When Clayton died I made him a promise
I was gonna carry on somehow
I'd give a hundred dollars if he could only see me now
I remember the year that Clayton Delaney died
Nobody ever knew it but I went out in the woods and I cried
Well I know there's a lotta big preachers that know a lot more than I do
But it could be that the good Lord likes a little picking too
Yeah I remember the year that Clayton Delaney died

Tommy Cash,One Song Away,1970-07-20,1970-10-05,"

I'm just one song away from bein' home I'm one song away from bein' home
I've got one more verse to do and if the crowd'll let me through
I'm just one song away from bein' home

Every hotel clerk looks like the last and most girls are just waiting to be asked
Every town looks the same and there's no more new names
And the future looks worse than the past
But I'm just one song away...
( ac.guitar )
All the words to my songs lose their meaning
All the dressing rooms seem to need cleaning
Every town has different weather all the days run together
But I have to smile and knock out my routine
But I'm just one song away...
I'm just one song away...

Tommy Cash,Rise And Shine,1970-03-30,1970-06-22,"

Little children, do not worry cause you still got lots of time
There's no need in walking backwards, turn around and rise and shine
If your load always seems heavy, and you're always left behind
Pick yourself up from the ground, and jump right back and rise and shine

Rise and shine in the early morning, shine your light on through the day
Makes no diff'rence what they tell you, stand right up and have your say
'Cause the good Lord said He loves you, and through Him your strength you'll find --
Even though the world may use you, turn around and rise and shine
( ac.guitar - trumpet )
Look at how they did poor Jesus, why, they nailed Him to a cross
But He died up there on Calv'ry so the world would not be lost
So don't matter how they treat you, if they slap you in the face
Just remember Jesus loves you, and on the Cross He took your place

Rise and shine in the early morning, shine your light on through the day
Makes no diff'rence what they tell you, stand right up and have your say
'Cause the good Lord says He loves you, and through Him your strength you'll find
Even though the world may use you, get out now, go rise and shine

Rise and shine in the early morning . .

So this is love I've never been here before
And when I leave I won't come back anymore
For everything I've met since I've been here has only brought me pain
So when I leave I won't come back again

Well here I am on the corner of Heart and Mind
And the citizens of love are running blind
Reckon one another's hearts and cryin' all the while
Just like pain was goin' out of style
So this is love...
[ trumpet - ac. Guitar ]
Where shoud I go from the corner of Heart and Mind
Love is in the state of confusion all the time
Heartaches are always present makes no difference where you turn
And the taxes take what happiness you earn
So this is love...
So when I leave I won't come back again
So when I leave I won't come back again

Tommy Collins,"If You Can't Bite, Don't Growl",1966-01-31,1966-04-25,"

I whistled at a pretty girl on a corner down town
She saw me when I winked my eye and then she turned around
She came and took me by the arm, I told her I didn't mean no harm
She said to me with a certain kind of scowl

""If you don't mean a thing, don't whistle
If you can't bite, don't growl""

One night, I left the wife at home and went out with the boys
I was actin' like a dumb one and makin' a lot of noise
A go-go girl hold my hand, I said, ""I can't, I'm a married man""
She said, ""If you ain't gonna steal, you better not crawl""

Don't do-si-do with a go-go
If you can't bite, don't growl

I went home to the little wife and grabbed her at the door
I kissed her like a mad man and let out a lion roar
I jumped down from a chandelier and beat my chest
And said, ""Come here""
She said, ""If you can't haunt, you better not howl""

I'm a wampus kitty and a mean mama
If you can't bite, don't growl

I jumped down from a chandelier and beat my chest

I would send her a rose
When I couldn't make it home
I was always away she was always alone

But roses couldn't hold her tight
Or keep her warm in the night
And in time she slipped away
I can still hear her say

Send me no roses
Send no roses today
Just like our dreams
The fragrance will soon fade away

The magic is gone
Our love has died on the vine
Send no roses
Roses can't bring it back this time

Empty arms reaching out
Left so unsatisfied
Needing so much to find
The love she was denied

What she wanted was my love
Roses weren't quite enough
I remember the day that I heard baby say

Send me no roses
Send no roses today
Just like our dreams
The fragrance will soon fade away

The magic is gone
Our love has died on the vine
Send no roses
Roses can't bring it back this time

Well, I'm gonna sit right here until I die

And it tore me up ev'ry time I heard his drawl, that Southern Drawl
Then I heard my dream was back downstream cavortin' in Davenport
And I followed you, Big River, when you called, aw yeah

Then you took me to St. Louis later on, down the river
A freighter said she's been here but she's gone, boy, she's gone
I found her trail in Memphis, but she just walked up the bluff
She raised a few eyebrows and went on down alone

Well I pulled into Naches next day down the river
But there wasn't that much to make around to stay very long
But when I left, it was rainin' so nobody saw me cry

Now, won't you batter down by Baton Rouge? River Queen, rollin' on
Take that man on down to New Orleans, said New Orleans
Go on, I've had enough, put my blues down in the gulf

He was on his way home from Candletop
Been two weeks gone and he'd thought he'd stop at Webb's
And have him a drink before he went home to her

Andy Wolloe said hello
And he said, ""Hi, what's doing, Wo?""
Said, ""Sit down, I got some bad news, it's gonna hurt.""

He said, ""I'm your best friend and you know that's right
But your young bride ain't home tonight
Since you been gone, she's been seeing that Amos boy, Seth.""

Well, he got mad and he saw red
And Andy said, ""Boy, don't you lose your head
Cause to tell you the truth, I've been with her myself.""

That's the night that the lights went out in Georgia
That's the night that they hung an innocent man
Well, don't trust your soul to no backwoods southern lawyer
Cause the judge in the town's got bloodstains on his hands

Well, Andy got scared and left the bar
Walking on home, cause he didn't live far
See, Andy didn't have many friends
And he just lost him one

Brother thought his wife musta left town
So he went home and finally found
The only thing Papa had left him and that was a gun

Then he went off to Andy's house
Slippin' through the backwoods, quiet as a mouse
Came upon some tracks too small for Andy to make
He looked through the screen at the back porch door
And he saw Andy lying on the floor
In a puddle of blood and he started to shake

Well, the Georgia patrol was making their rounds
So he fired a shot just to flag them down
And a big-bellied sheriff grabbed his gun
And said ""Why'd you do it?""

Well, the judge said guilty in a make-believe trial
Slapped the sheriff on the back with a smile
Said, ""Supper's waitin' at home and I gotta get to it.""

That's the night that the lights went out in Georgia
That's the night that they hung an innocent man
Well, don't trust your soul to no backwoods southern lawyer
Cause the judge in the town's got bloodstains on his hands

Well, they hung my brother before I could say
The tracks he saw while on his way
To Andy's house and back that night were mine
And his cheating wife had never left town
And that's one body that'll never be found
See, little sister don't miss when she aims her gun

That's the night that the lights went out in Georgia, whoa-oh
That's the night that they hung an innocent man, uh-huh

(Words and music by Crofford)

How old was I when I first seen old Rivers?
I can't remember when he weren't around
Well, that old fellow did a heap of work
Spent his whole life walking plowed ground

He had a one-room shack not far from us
And well, we was about as poor as him
He had one old mule he called Midnight
And I'd trailed along after them

He used to plow them rows straight and deep
And I'd come along near behind
A-bustin' up clods with my own bare feet
Old Rivers was a friend of mine

That sun'd get high and that mule would work
Till old Rivers'd say, Whoa!
He'd wipe his brow, lean back on the reins
And talk about a place he was gonna go

Chorus:
He'd say, one of these days
I'm gonna climb that mountain
Walk up there amoung the clouds
Where the cotton's high
And the corn's a-growin'
And there ain't no fields to plow

--- Instrumental ---

I got a letter today from the folks back home and
They're all fine and crops is dry
Down at the end my mama said, Son
You know old Rivers died

Just sittin' here now on this new-plowed earth
Trying to find me a little shade
With the sun beating down 'cross the field I see
That mule, old Rivers and me

Chorus:
Now, one of these days
I'm gonna climb that mountain
Walk up there amoung the clouds
Where the cotton's high
And the corn's a-growin'

Just a box of pine all covered fine with stars and stripes
With diverted look he wonders why his mommy looks so sad

Tears will be the chaser for your wine after you leave this love of mine
Bright lights and taverns that's where you'll spend your time
And tears will be the chaser for your wine

Before you make up your mind you really want to go

When the part is over then what will you do
When you wanna come back there'll be no place for you
And tears will be the chaser...

Waylon Jennings,Brown Eyed Handsome Man,1969-12-01,1970-03-02,"

[Verse 1]
Flying cross the desert in a TWA
I saw a woman walking cross the sand
She'd been a walking thirty miles on route to LA
To get a brown eyed handsome man
Her destination was a brown eyed handsome man
Milo Venus was a beautiful lass
She had the world in the palm of her hand
But she lost both her arms in a wrestling match
To get a brown eyed handsome man
She fought and won herself a brown eyed handsome man

[Chorus]
Way back in history thee thousand years in fact
Ever since the world began
Been a whole lot of women who shedding tears
For a brown eyed handsome man
It was the trouble was a brown eyed handsome man

[Instrumental]

[Verse 2]
Beautiful daughter couldn't make up her mind
Between a doctor and a lawyer man
Her mama told her darling go out and find
Yourself a brown eyed handsome man
Just like your daddy is a brown eyed handsome man
Arrested on charges of unemployment
Sitting in the witness stand
The Judge's wife called up the district attorney
She said free that brown eyed handsome man
If you want your job you better free that brown eyed man

Waylon Jennings,"Cedartown, Georgia",1971-08-23,1971-11-08,"

[Verse]
I got a gal in Cedartown Georgia
I used to have to walk nearly three miles to court her
She never had much, just a sharecropper's daughter
But I married her and took her down to New Orleans
Bought a little house in the South French Quarter
Got a job hooking bales, loading them on a steamboat
I give her seven days pay next day I'm broke
When she ain't a sleeping all day she's a primping
Every evening when the sun goes down
She starts a swarming on Orleans town
Walking into work this morning at daybreak
I caught her with the tall long dandy from canebreak
She walked right by me and she looked right through me
I made up my mind what I'm a gonna do
Eased in the pawnshop and bought a 22
Watched as the roomclerk gave them a room key
Standing outside I could read Room 23
Tonight I'll put her on a train for Georgia
Gonna be a lotta kin folks squalling and a grieving
'Cause that Cedartown gal ain't breathing...

Waylon Jennings,Delia's Gone,1969-05-26,1969-06-23,"

Delia, oh Delia, where have you been so long?
If buddy's talkin' 'bout Delia they say she's done me wrong
They took my Delia to the graveyard, took her in a long black hearse
If I hadn't shot my poor Delia I believe she'd have got me first
Delia's gone
Went down to the graveyard to look at my Delia's face
I said, Delia girl how I love you and I wish I could take your place
Jailer, oh jailer, tell me how can I sleep
When all around my bedside I hear little Delia's feet?
Delia's gone
Some gave Delia a dollar, some gave her two or three
But I didn't give Delia a penny 'cause she belonged to me
Delia's gone, Delia's gone

[Verse]
Green River, I've come back to you do you remember me
Do you remember Molly with the soft blue eyes
I left here with a lot of dreams none of them came true
What I wanted was here waiting all the time
Green River, did she come here every evening
Like the neighbors say she did so faithfully
Green River, has she's gone away forever
She just disappeared one day as she gave upon me
Green River, if you see her won't you tell her I'll return
All I've brought her is myself and this little dream
Please tell her that I love her and my lesson I have learned
Green River, tell her please come back to me...

[Verse 1]
I hope that the friend
You've thrown yourself with
He gets drunk and loses his job
And every road that you travel on
Is dusty, rocky and hard
I couldn't make you love me
You only made me blue
So all in all, if the curtain should fall
Lord, I hope that it falls on you

[Chorus]
I will have sweet, sweet, sweet mental revenge
I will have sweet, sweet, sweet mental revenge

[Instrumental]

[Verse 2]
Well, I hope that the train
From Caribou Maine
Runs over your new love affair
You walk the floor
From door to door
And pull out your peroxide hair
You never was my woman
Because you were never true
So all in all if the curtain should fall
Lord, I hope that it falls on you

[Verse 1]
The reflections of the trees are cut by the bow of my pirogue
And spattered by the paddle of my eager hand
That Mississippi woman is a waving over yonder
Waving her lantern for her Louisiana man

[Chorus]
How I love that Mississippi woman
How I love that Mississippi girl
How I love that Mississippi woman
But her heart does not belong to me

[Verse 2]
The lantern light and moonbeams are dancing patterns on the water
She doesn't seem to realize I've learned her secret plans
My jealous mind is thinking as I paddle through the sleeping alligators
She don't know I know about her Louisiana man

[Chorus]

The reflections of the trees are cut by the bow of my pirogue
And splattered by the paddle of my shaky hand
The silence from behind me is alive with the splashing alligators
And the lantern light is blinking on the bottom in the sand

I only meant to love you don't you know it babe
Why couldn't you be contented with the love I gave
I've given you my heart and now you want my mind
Your love scares me to death girl it's the choking kind
You can kill a man with bullets poison or a knife
But it hurts him more to take his pride and run his life
Whatever it is you want girl I hope you find
But that hat don't fit my head it's the choking kind
When you fall in love again girl take a tip from me
If you don't like the peaches walk on by the tree
Find what you want and keep it treat it sweet and kind
But let it breathe don't make your love the choking kind...

Waylon Jennings,The Days Of Sand And Shovels,1969-06-02,1969-08-04,"

When I noticed her the first time
I was outside running barefoot in the rain
She lived in the house next door
And her nose was pressed against the window pane

When she looked at me
She smiled and showed a place where two teeth used to be
And I heard her ask her mom
If she could come outside and play with me

We became as one and
Had a love without beginning or an end
And every day she lived with me
Was like a new day dawning once again

Chorus:
And I've loved her since
Every doll was Shirley Temple
Soda pop was still a nickel
Jam was on her fingertips
Milk was circled on her lips

After many years our love grew silent
And at night I heard her cry
When she left me in the fall
I knew that it would be our last goodbye

I was man enough to give her everything
She needed for a while
But in searching for a perfect love
I found that I could not give her a child

He's a giver, he'll give her the kind
Of attention that she's never known
He's a helper, he'll help her to open
The doors that she can't on her own

[Verse 1]
He's a lover and he'll love her in ways
That she's never been loved before
He's a getter, he'll get her by getting her
Into the world she's been hungering for
He's a charmer, he'll charm her with money
And manners that I never learned
He's a leader, he'll lead her across
Pretty bridges he's planning to burn
He's a talker, he'll talk her right off of her feet
But he won't talk for long
'Cause he's a doer, and he'll do her the way
That I'd never, damned if he won't do her wrong

[Chorus]
He's a taker, he'll take her to places
And make her fly higher than she's ever dared to
He'll take his time before taking advantage
Taking her easy and slow

[Verse 2]
And after he's taken the body and soul
She gives him he'll take her for granted
Take off and leave her taken all of her
Pride when he goes

There are some things that a man must do
And it's time to bum again

And it's got me running scared and blind

Feel simple love is simple true
There's no end to what I'd do

Let the world call me a fool
But if things are right with me and you
That's all that matters
And I'll do anything you asked me to

Knowing how much I love you
And after all that I've been through
I'd turn and walk away from you
Just because you asked me to

Between the parted pages and were pressed
In love's hot fevered iron like a stripped pair of pants
Mac Arthur Park is melting in the dark all the sweet green ising flowing down
Someone left the cake out in the rain
But I don't think that I can take it Lord it took so long to bake it

And birds like tender babies in your hands

There will be another dream for me someone will bring it

But after all the loves of my life after all the loves of my life you'll still be the one
I will take my life into my hands and I will use it

I just recieved the letter that you wrote in deep despair
You say your heart to me is closed and you no longer care
What can I say or do to make you change your mind again
Oh won't you open up your heart and let forgiveness in
I may pretend I never cry to tell the truth I do
For sadness came with your goodbye and you're unhappy too
For if it's true you care for me to hide it is a sin
Oh won't you open up your heart and let forgiveness in
[ fiddle - steel ]
I'd give the world to hear you say you love me as before
And that the happy yesterday is ours to live once more
Let's live again the used to be rewards so happy then
Oh won't you open up your heart and let forgiveness in

Webb Pierce,No Love Have I,1959-12-21,1960-04-18,"

Honey bee loves the honey chickadee loves the sky
Everybody loves somebody but no love have I no love have I
Standing on the corner lovers pass me by
How my heart is crying cause no love have I no love have I
(Every night in my prayers I pray for some lost love to come my way)
Then we'll spend our lonely hours making love in an ivory tower
Lonely is the city when the moon lights up the sky
But what good is that moonlight if no love have I no love have I
(Every night in my prayers I pray...

Willie Nelson,Blackjack County Chain,1967-06-26,1967-08-28,"

[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1: Willie Nelson]
I was sitting beside the road in Blackjack County
Not knowing that the sheriff paid a bounty
For men like me who didn't have a penny to their name

[Refrain: Willie Nelson]
So he locked my leg to thirty-five pounds of Blackjack County chains

[Verse 2: Willie Nelson, Waylon Jennings, & Both]
And all we had to eat was bread and water
Each day we had to build that road a mile and a quarter
And blacksnake whip would cut our backs when some poor fool complained

[Refrain: Willie Nelson]
But we couldn't fight back wearing thirty-five pounds of Blackjack County chains

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3: Waylon Jennings & Willie Nelson]
But then one night while the sheriff was a sleeping
We all gathered 'round him slowly creeping
And heaven help me to forget that night in the cold cold rain

[Refrain: Both]
When we beat him to death with the thirty-five pounds of Blackjack County chains

[Verse 4: Willie Nelson & Both]
Now the whip marks have all healed and I am thankful
That there's nothing but a scar round my ankle
Most of all I'm glad no man will be a slave again

[Refrain: Both]
To a blacksnake whip and thirty-five pounds of Blackjack County chains
To a blacksnake whip and thirty-five pounds of Blackjack County chains

Baby left me without warning
Sometime in the night
So I'm flying down to Houston
With forgetting her the nature of my flight

[Verse 1]
As we taxi down the runway
With the smog and haze reminding me
Of how I feel
Just a country boy who's learning
That the pitfalls of the city
Are extremely real
All the night life and parties
Temptation and deceit
The order of the day
Well, it's a bloody Mary morning
'Cause I'm leaving baby
Somewhere in LA

[Chorus]
Well, it's a bloody Mary morning
Baby left me without warning
Sometime in the night
So I'm flying down to Houston
With forgetting her the nature of my flight

[Verse 2]
Well, our golden jet is airborne
And Flight 50 cuts a path
Across the morning sky
And a voice comes through the speaker
Reassuring us Flight 50 is the way to fly
And a hostess takes our order
Coffee, tea or something stronger
To start off the day
Well, it's a bloody Mary morning
'Cause I'm leaving baby
Somewhere in LA

[Chorus]
Well, it's a bloody Mary morning
Baby left me without warning
Sometime in the night
So I'm flying down to Houston
With forgetting her the nature of my flight

[Verse 1]
Touch me
Touch the hand of the man who once owned all the world
Touch me
Touch the arms that once held all the charms of the world's sweetest girl
Touch me
Maybe someday you may need to know how it feels when you lose
So touch me
And you will know how you'd feel with the blues

[Verse 2]
Watch me
Watch the eyes that have seen all the heartbreak and pain in the land
And be thankful
That you're happy though standing so close to the world's bluest man
Don't forget me
Take a good look at someone who's lost everything he can lose
Then touch me
And you'll know how you'd feel with the blues

[Outro]
Don't forget me
Take a good look at someone who's lost everything he can lose
Then touch me
And you'll know how you'd feel with the blues

Oh it's been such a long long time
Looks like I'd get you off my mind

Turns my whole world a misty blue

Wink Martindale,Deck Of Cards,1959-10-19,1959-12-28,"

NARRATIVE:
During the North African campaign, a bunch of soldier boys had
Been on a long hike and they arrived in a little town called Casino. The
Next morning being Sunday, several of the boys went to Church. A sergeant
Commanded the boys in Church and after the Chaplain had read the prayer
The text was taken up next. Those of the boys who had a prayer book took
Them out, but this one boy had only a deck of cards, and so he spread
Them out. The Sergeant saw the cards and said, ""Soldier, put away those
Cards."" After the services was over, the soldier was taken prisoner and
Brought before the Provost Marshall

The Marshall said, ""Sergeant, why have you brought this man
Here?"" ""For playing cards in church, Sir."" ""And what have you to say for
Yourself, son?"" ""Much, Sir,"" replied the soldier. The Marshall said, ""I
Hope so, for if not I shall punish you more than any man was ever
Punished."" The soldier said, ""Sir, I have been on the march for about six
Days. I have neither a Bible nor a prayer book, but I hope to satisfy
You, Sir, with the purity of my intentions."" And with that, the boy
Started his story:

""You see Sir, when I look at the Ace, it reminds me that there
Is but one God. And the Deuce reminds me that the Bible is divided into
Two parts, the Old and the New Testaments. When I see the Trey, I think
Of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost. And when I see the Four, I
Think of the four Evangelists who preached the Gospel; there was Matthew

Mark, Luke and John. And when I see the Five, it reminds me of the five
Wise virgins who trimmed their lamps; there were ten of them: five were
Wise and were saved, five were foolish and were shut out. When I see the
Six, it reminds me that in six days, God made this great heaven and
Earth. When I see the Seven, it reminds me that on the seventh day, God
Rested from His great work. And when I see the Eight, I think of the
Eight righteous persons God saved when He destroyed this earth; there was
Noah, his wife, their sons and their wives. And when I see the Nine, I
Think of the lepers our Savior cleansed, and nine out of the ten didn't
Even thank Him. When I see the Ten, I think of the Ten Commandments God
Handed down to Moses on a table of stone. When I see the King, it
Reminds me that there is but one King of Heaven, God Almighty. And when I
See the Queen, I think of the Blessed Virgin Mary, who is Queen of
Heaven. And the Jack or Knave is the Devil. When I count the number
Of spots on a deck of cards, I find 365, the number of days in a year
There are 52 cards, the number of weeks in a year. There are 4 suits, the
Number of weeks in a month. There are 12 picture cards, the number of
Months in a year. There are 13 tricks, the number of weeks in a quarter
So you see, Sir, my pack of cards serves me as a Bible, an Almanac and a
Prayer Book.""

""And friends, the story is true. I know, I was that soldier.""

Wynn Stewart,'Cause I Have You,1967-07-24,1967-10-23,"

A flower needs the earth to make it grow
A river needs the rains to make it flow
A clinging vine needs something to cling to
But I have all I need cause I have you

Before we met my life was one sad song
But you changed all that the day you came along
For a true love song needs inspiration too
And I have all I need cause I have you
[ steel ]
Arms need more than arms to hold on to
And lips need other lips to make dreams come true
Two hearts in love will always beat in two
And our hearts beat as one since I have you
Before we met...

I'll just live my life in dreams and I long for your love

Won't you answer a heart that is broken

Wrong company
Writer Harlan Howard

I've lost the only love I've ever known
Too many nights I left her all alone
I said forgive me, one too many times
And now her parting words ___ my mind
You're with the Wrong Company they'll drag you down
You're spending too much time on the wrong side of town
Now it's your life to live, but it's my heart to give
And if you still want me, give up that wrong company
She warned me but I've wasted my last chance
And now she's gone without a backward glance
Oh how I miss the love I threw away
Every song on that jukebox seems to say

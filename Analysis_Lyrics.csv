Green Day,American Idiot,"[Verse 1]
Don't wanna be an American idiot
Don't want a nation under the new media
And can you hear the sound of hysteria?
The subliminal mind-fuck America

[Chorus]
Welcome to a new kind of tension
All across the alien nation
Where everything isn't meant to be okay
Television dreams of tomorrow
We're not the ones who're meant to follow
For that's enough to argue

[Verse 2]
Well, maybe I'm the faggot, America
I'm not a part of a redneck agenda
Now everybody do the propaganda
And sing along to the age of paranoia

[Chorus]
Welcome to a new kind of tension
All across the alien nation
Where everything isn't meant to be okay
Television dreams of tomorrow
We're not the ones who're meant to follow
For that's enough to argue

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Don't wanna be an American idiot
One nation controlled by the media
Information age of hysteria
It's calling out to idiot America

[Chorus]
Welcome to a new kind of tension
All across the alien nation
Where everything isn't meant to be okay
Television dreams of tomorrow
We're not the ones who're meant to follow
For that's enough to argue"
John Lennon,Imagine,"[Verse 1]
Imagine there's no heaven
It's easy if you try
No hell below us
Above us, only sky
Imagine all the people living for today
Ah

Imagine there's no countries
It isn't hard to do
Nothing to kill or die for
And no religion too
Imagine all the people living life in peace
You

[Chorus]
You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope some day you'll join us
And the world will live as one

[Verse 2]
Imagine no possessions
I wonder if you can
No need for greed or hunger
A brotherhood of man
Imagine all the people sharing all the world
You

[Chorus]
You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope some day you'll join us
And the world will live as one"
Sex Pistols,God Save The Queen,"[Verse 1]
God save the queen, the fascist regime
They made you a moron, potential H-bomb
God save the queen, she ain't no human being
There is no future in England's dreaming
Don't be told what you want, don't be told what you need
There's no future, no future, no future for you

[Hook]
God save the queen, we mean it man
We love our queen, God saves

[Verse 2]
God save the queen, cause tourists are money
And our figurehead is not what she seems
Oh, God save history, God save your mad parade
Oh, Lord, God have mercy, all crimes are paid
When there's no future, how can there be sin
We're the flowers in the dustbin
We're the poison in your human machine
We're the future, your future

[Hook]
God save the queen, we mean it man
We love our queen, God saves
God save the queen, we mean it man
And there is no future in England's dreaming

[Outro]
No future, no future, no future for you
No future, no future, no future for me..."

You say you want a revolution
Well, you know

No Doubt,Just A Girl,"[Verse 1]
Take this pink ribbon off my eyes
I'm exposed, and it's no big surprise
Don't you think I know exactly where I stand?
This world is forcing me to hold your hand

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm just a girl, oh, little old me
Well, don't let me out of your sight
Oh, I'm just a girl, all pretty and petite
So don't let me have any rights

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, I've had it up to here

[Verse 2]
The moment that I step outside
So many reasons for me to run and hide
I can't do the little things I hold so dear
'Cause it's all those little things that I fear

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm just a girl, I'd rather not be
'Cause they won't let me drive late at night
Oh, I'm just a girl, guess I'm some kind of freak
'Cause they all sit and stare with their eyes
Oh, I'm just a girl, take a good look at me
Just your typical prototype

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, I've had it up to here
Oh, am I making myself clear?

[Bridge]
I'm just a girl
I'm just a girl in the world
That's all that you'll let me be

[Chorus]
Oh, I'm just a girl, living in captivity
Your rule of thumb makes me worrisome
Oh, I'm just a girl, what's my destiny?
What I've succumbed to is making me numb
Oh, I'm just a girl, my apologies
What I've become is so burdensome
Oh, I'm just a girl, lucky me
Twiddle-dum, there's no comparison

Bob Dylan,A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall,"[Verse 1]
Oh, where have you been, my blue-eyed son?
And where have you been, my darling young one?
Ive stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains
Ive walked and Ive crawled on six crooked highways
Ive stepped in the middle of seven sad forests
Ive been out in front of a dozen dead oceans
Ive been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard

[Chorus]
And its a hard, and its a hard, its a hard, its a hard
Its a hard rains a-going to fall

[Verse 2]
Oh, what did you see, my blue-eyed son?
And what did you see, my darling young one?
I saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it
I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it
I saw a black branch with blood that kept dripping
I saw a room full of men with their hammers a-bleeding
I saw a white ladder all covered with water
I saw ten-thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken
I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children

[Chorus]
And its a hard, its a hard, its a hard, and its a hard
Its a hard rains a-going to fall

[Verse 3]
And what did you hear, my blue-eyed son?
And what did you hear, my darling young one?
I heard the sound of a thunder that roared out a warning
I heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world
I heard one hundred drummers whose hands were a-blazing
I heard ten-thousand whispering and nobody listening
I heard one person starve, I heard many people laughing
I heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter
I heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley

[Chorus]
And its a hard, its a hard, its a hard, its a hard
Its a hard rains a-going to fall

[Verse 4]
Oh, what did you meet, my blue-eyed son?
And who did you meet, my darling young one?
I met a young child beside a dead pony
I met a white man who walked a black dog
I met a young woman, her body was burning
I met a young girl, she gave me a rainbow
I met one man who was wounded in love
I met another man who was wounded in hatred

[Chorus]
And its a hard, its a hard, its a hard, its a hard
Its a hard rains a-going to fall

[Verse 5]
And what will you do now, my blue-eyed son?
And what will you do now, my darling young one?
Im a-going back out fore the rain starts a-falling
Ill walk to the depths of the deepest dark forest
Where the people are many and their hands are all empty
Where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters
Where the home in the valley meets the damp dirty prison
And the executioners face is always well hidden
Where hunger is ugly, where the souls are forgotten
Where black is the color, where none is the number
And Ill tell it, and speak it, and think it, and breathe it
And reflect from the mountain so all souls can see it
Then Ill stand on the ocean until I start sinking
But Ill know my song well before I start singing

[Chorus]
And its a hard, its a hard, its a hard, and its a hard
Its a hard rains a-going to fall"
Manic Street Preachers,If You Tolerate This Your Children Will Be Next,"

The future teaches you to be alone
The present to be afraid and cold
So if I can shoot rabbits then I can shoot fascists
Bullets for your brain today
But we'll forget it all again
Monuments put from pen to paper
Turns me into a gutless wonder

And if you tolerate this then your children will be next
And if you tolerate this then your children will be next
Will be next, will be next, will be next

Gravity keeps my head down
Or is it maybe shame
At being so young and being so vain
Holes in your head today
But I'm a pacifist
I've walked Las Ramblas but not with real intent

And if you tolerate this then your children will be next
And if you tolerate this then your children will be next
Will be next, will be next, will be next, will be next

And on the street tonight an old man plays
With newspaper cuttings of his glory days

And if you tolerate this then your children will be next
And if you tolerate this then your children will be next
Will be next, will be next, will be next

We ban that boogie sound
Degenerate the faithful
With that crazy Casbah sound

Got his guitar pickin' thumb
As soon as the Sharif
Cleared the square
They began to wail

Drop your bombs between the minarets

The cockpit radio blare
As soon as the Sharif was
Out of their hair

This town, is coming like a ghost town
All the clubs have been closed down
This place, is coming like a ghost town

Too much fighting on the dance floor

Do you remember the good old days before the ghost town?
We danced and sang, and the music played in a de boomtown

This town, is coming like a ghost town
Why must the youth fight against themselves?
Government leaving the youth on the shelf
This place, is coming like a ghost town
No job to be found in this country
Can't go on no more
The people getting angry

This town, is coming like a ghost town

This town, is coming like a ghost town

Because the revolution will not be televised

The revolution will not be televised
The revolution will not be brought to you by Xerox in 4 parts without commercial interruptions
The revolution will not show you pictures of Nixon blowing a bugle and leading a charge by John Mitchell, General Abrams and Spiro Agnew to eat hog maws confiscated from a Harlem sanctuary
The revolution will not be televised

The revolution will not be brought to you by the Schaefer Award Theatre and will not star Natalie Wood and Steve McQueen or Bullwinkle and Julia
The revolution will not give your mouth sex appeal
The revolution will not get rid of the nubs
The revolution will not make you look five pounds thinner because the revolution will not be televised, Brother

There will be no pictures of you and Willie May pushing that shopping cart down the block on the dead run, or trying to slide that color TV into a stolen ambulance
NBC will not be able to predict the winner at 8:32 on reports from 29 districts
The revolution will not be televised

There will be no pictures of pigs shooting down brothers on the instant replay
There will be no pictures of pigs shooting down brothers on the instant replay
There will be no pictures of Whitney Young being run out of Harlem on a rail with a brand new process
There will be no slow motion or still life of Roy Wilkens strolling through Watts in a red, black and green liberation jumpsuit that he had been saving for just the proper occasion

Green Acres, The Beverly Hillbillies, and Hooterville Junction will no longer be so damned relevant, and women will not care if Dick finally screwed Jane on Search for Tomorrow because black people will be in the street looking for a brighter day
The revolution will not be televised

There will be no highlights on the eleven o'clock news, and no pictures of hairy armed women liberationists and Jackie Onassis blowing her nose
The theme song will not be written by Jim Webb or Francis Scott Key, nor sung by Glen Campbell, Tom Jones, Johnny Cash, Englebert Humperdink, or the Rare Earth
The revolution will not be televised

The revolution will not be right back after a message about a white tornado, white lightning, or white people
You will not have to worry about a dove in your bedroom, the tiger in your tank, or the giant in your toilet bowl
The revolution will not go better with Coke
The revolution will not fight germs that may cause bad breath
The revolution will put you in the driver's seat

The revolution will not be televised, will not be televised, will not be televised, will not be televised
The revolution will be no re-run, brothers
The revolution will be live"
Billy Bragg,Between The Wars,"[verse 1]
I was a miner
I was a docker
I was a railway man
Between the wars

[verse 2]
I raised a family
In time of austerity
With sweat at the foundry
Between the wars

[verse 3]
I paid the union
And as times got harder
I looked to the government
To help the working man

[verse 4]
But they brought prosperity
Down at the armory
We're arming for peace, me boys
Between the wars

[verse 5]
I kept the faith and
I kept voting
Not for the iron fist
But for the helping hand

[verse 6]
For theirs is a land
With a wall around it;
And mine is a faith
In my fellow man

[verse 7]
Theirs is a land of
Hope and glory;
Mine is the green field and
The factory floor

[verse 8]
Theirs are the skies all
Dark with bombers;
And mine is the peace we knew
Between the wars

[verse 9]
Call up the craftsmen
Bring me the draftsmen
Build me a path
From cradle to grave

[verse 10]
And I'll give my consent
To any government
That does not deny a man
A living wage

[verse 11]
Go find the young men
Never to fight again
Bring up the banners from the
Days gone by

[verse 12]
Sweet moderation
Heart of this nation:
Desert us not
We are between the wars"
Bruce Hornsby,The Way It Is,"[Verse 1]
Standin' in line, marking time
Waiting for the welfare dime
'Cause they can't buy a job
The man in the silk suit hurries by
As he catches the poor old lady's eyes
Just for fun, he says ""Get a job""

[Chorus]
That's just the way it is
Some things'll never change
That's just the way it is
Ha, but don't you believe them

[Verse 2]
Said, ""Hey little boy, you can't go where the others go
'Cause you don't look like they do""
Said, ""Hey old man, how can you stand to think that way?
Did you really think about it before you made the rules?""
He said

[Chorus]
That's just the way it is
Some things'll never change
That's just the way it is
Ha, but don't you believe them

[Instrumental Solo]

[Chorus]
That's just the way it is
That's just the way it is

[Verse 3]
Well, they passed a law in '64
To give those who ain't got, a little more
But it only goes so far
'Cause the law don't change another's mind
When all it sees at the hiring time
Is the line on the color bar
But who knows

[Chorus]
That's just the way it is
Some things'll never change
That's just the way it is
That's just the way it is, it is, it is, it is"
The Smiths,Meat Is Murder,"[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Heifer whines could be human cries
Closer comes the screaming knife
This beautiful creature must die
This beautiful creature must die
A death for no reason
And death for no reason is murder
And the flesh you so fancifully fry
Is not succulent, tasty or kind
It's death for no reason
And death for no reason is murder
And the calf that you carve with a smile
Is murder
And the turkey you festively slice
Is murder
Do you know how animals die?

[Verse 2]
Kitchen aromas aren't very homely
It's not comforting, cheery or kind
It's sizzling blood and the unholy stench of murder
It's not natural, normal or kind
The flesh you so fancifully fry
The meat in your mouth
As you savour the flavour of murder
No, no, no, it's murder
No, no, no, it's murder
Oh... and who hears when animals cry?


[Outro]"
Bruce Springsteen,Born In The USA,"[Verse 1]
Born down in a dead man's town
The first kick I took was when I hit the ground
You end up like a dog that's been beat too much
'Til you spend half your life just coverin' up

[Chorus]
Born in the U.S.A
I was born in the U.S.A
I was born in the U.S.A
Born in the U.S.A

[Verse 2]
Got in a little hometown jam
So they put a rifle in my hand
Sent me off to a foreign land
To go and kill the yellow man

[Chorus]
Born in the U.S.A
I was born in the U.S.A
I was born in the U.S.A
I was born in the U.S.A

[Verse 3]
Come back home to the refinery
Hiring man says ""Son if it was up to me""
Went down to see my V.A. man
He said ""Son, don't you understand""

[Verse 4]
I had a brother at Khe Sanh fighting off the Viet Cong
They're still there, he's all gone
He had a woman he loved in Saigon
I got a picture of him in her arms now

[Verse 5]
Down in the shadow of the penitentiary
Out by the gas fires of the refinery
I'm ten years burning down the road
Nowhere to run ain't got nowhere to go

[Chorus]
Born in the U.S.A
I was born in the U.S.A
Born in the U.S.A
I'm a long gone Daddy in the U.S.A
Born in the U.S.A
Born in the U.S.A
Born in the U.S.A
I'm a cool rocking Daddy in the U.S.A"

Oh, but who are they to judge us
Simply because our hair is long
Oh, you know we've got to find a way
To bring some understanding here today

Grandmaster Flash And The Furious Five,The Message,"[Intro]
It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from going under
It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from going under

[Verse 1]
Broken glass everywhere
People pissing on the stairs, you know they just don't care
I can't take the smell, can't take the noise
Got no money to move out, I guess I got no choice
Rats in the front room, roaches in the back
Junkies in the alley with a baseball bat
I tried to get away but I couldn't get far
’Cause a man with a tow truck repossessed my car

[Chorus]
Don't push me, ’cause I'm close to the edge
I'm trying not to lose my head
It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from going under

[Verse 2]
Standing on the front stoop, hanging out the window
Watching all the cars go by, roaring as the breezes blow
Crazy lady, living in a bag
Eating out of garbage pails, used to be a fag hag
Said she'll dance the tango, skip the light fandango
A Zircon princess seemed to lost her senses
Down at the peep show watching all the creeps
So she can tell her stories to the girls back home
She went to the city and got so so saditty
She had to get a pimp, she couldn't make it on her own


[Chorus]
Don't push me, ’cause I'm close to the edge
I'm trying not to lose my head
It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from going under

[Verse 3]
My brother's doing bad, stole my mother's TV
Says she watches too much, it's just not healthy
All My Children in the daytime, Dallas at night
Can't even see the game or the Sugar Ray fight
The bill collectors, they ring my phone
And scare my wife when I'm not home
Got a bum education, double-digit inflation
Can't take the train to the job, there's a strike at the station
Neon King Kong standing on my back
Can't stop to turn around, broke my sacroiliac
A mid-range migraine, cancered membrane
Sometimes I think I'm going insane
I swear I might hijack a plane!

[Chorus]
Don't push me, ’cause I'm close to the edge
I'm trying not to lose my head
It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from going under


[Verse 4]
My son said, Daddy, I don't wanna go to school
’Cause the teacher's a jerk, he must think I'm a fool
And all the kids smoke reefer, I think it'd be cheaper
If I just got a job, learned to be a street sweeper
Or dance to the beat, shuffle my feet
Wear a shirt and tie and run with the creeps
’Cause it's all about money; ain't a damn thing funny
You got to have a con in this land of milk and honey
They pushed that girl in front of the train
Took her to the doctor, sewed her arm on again
Stabbed that man right in his heart
Gave him a transplant for a brand new start
I can't walk through the park, ’cause it's crazy after dark
Keep my hand on my gun, ’cause they got me on the run
I feel like a outlaw, broke my last glass jaw
Hear them say ""You want some more?"", living on a see-saw

[Chorus]
Don't push me, ’cause I'm close to the edge
I'm trying not to lose my head
It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from going under

[Verse 5]
A child is born with no state of mind
Blind to the ways of mankind
God is smiling on you, but he's frowning too
Because only God knows what you'll go through
You'll grow in the ghetto living second-rate
And your eyes will sing a song called deep hate
The places you play and where you stay
Looks like one great big alleyway
You'll admire all the number-book takers
Thugs, pimps and pushers and the big money-makers
Driving big cars, spending twenties and tens
And you'll wanna grow up to be just like them, huh
Smugglers, scramblers, burglars, gamblers
Pickpocket peddlers, even panhandlers
You say ""I'm cool, huh, I'm no fool.""
But then you wind up dropping outta high school
Now you're unemployed, all null and void
Walking 'round like you're Pretty Boy Floyd
Turned stick-up kid, but look what you done did
Got sent up for a eight-year bid
Now your manhood is took and you're a Maytag
Spend the next two years as a undercover fag
Being used and abused to serve like hell
'Til one day you was found hung dead in the cell
It was plain to see that your life was lost
You was cold and your body swung back and forth
But now your eyes sing the sad, sad song
Of how you lived so fast and died so young, so...


[Chorus]
Don't push me, ’cause I'm close to the edge
I'm trying not to lose my head
It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from going under

N.W.A.,Fuck Tha Police,"[Intro: The D.O.C., Dr. Dre, and Ice Cube]
Right about now, N.W.A. court is in full effect
Judge Dre presiding
In the case of N.W.A. versus the Police Department
Prosecuting attorneys are; MC Ren, Ice Cube
And Eazy-motherfucking-E
Order, order, order!
Ice Cube, take the motherfucking stand
Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth
And nothing but the truth so help your black ass?
You goddamn right!
Well, won't you tell everybody what the fuck you gotta say?

[Verse 1: Ice Cube]
Fuck the police! Comin' straight from the underground
A young nigga got it bad ‘cause I'm brown
And not the other color, so police think
They have the authority to kill a minority
Fuck that shit ‘cause I ain't the one
For a punk motherfucker with a badge and a gun
To be beating on and thrown in jail
We can go toe-to-toe in the middle of a cell
Fuckin' with me ‘cause I'm a teenager
With a little bit of gold and a pager
Searchin' my car, lookin' for the product
Thinkin' every nigga is sellin' narcotics
You'd rather see me in the pen
Than me and Lorenzo rollin' in a Benz-o
Beat a police out of shape
And when I'm finished, bring the yellow tape
To tape off the scene of the slaughter
Still getting swole off bread and water
I don't know if they fags or what
Search a nigga down, and grabbing his nuts
And on the other hand, without a gun, they can't get none
But don't let it be a black and a white one
‘Cause they'll slam ya down to the street top
Black police showing out for the white cop
Ice Cube will swarm
On any motherfucker in a blue uniform
Just ‘cause I'm from the CPT
Punk police are afraid of me
Huh, a young nigga on the warpath
And when I'm finished, it's gonna be a bloodbath
Of cops, dying in L.A
Yo, Dre, I got something to say


[Chorus]
Fuck tha police!
Fuck tha police!
Fuck tha police!
Fuck tha police!

[Skit 1: Cop, MC Ren, & Dr. Dre]
Pull your goddamn ass over right now!
Aww shit, now, what the fuck you pullin' me over for?
‘Cause I feel like it!
Just sit your ass on the curb and shut the fuck up!
Man, fuck this shit!
A'ight, smartass, I'm taking your black ass to jail!
MC Ren, will you please give your testimony
To the jury about this fucked up incident?

[Verse 2: MC Ren]
Fuck the police! And Ren said it with authority
Because the niggas on the street is a majority
A gang is with whoever I'm steppin'
And the motherfuckin' weapon is kept in
A stash spot, for the so-called law
Wishing Ren was a nigga that they never saw
Lights start flashing behind me
But they're scared of a nigga, so they mace me to blind me
But that shit don't work, I just laugh
Because it gives them a hint not to step in my path
For police, I'm saying, ""Fuck you, punk!""
Reading my rights and shit, it's all junk
Pulling out a silly club, so you stand
With a fake-ass badge and a gun in your hand
But take off the gun so you can see what's up
And we'll go at it, punk, and I'ma fuck you up!
Make you think I'ma kick your ass
But drop your gat, and Ren's gonna blast
I'm sneaky as fuck when it comes to crime
But I'ma smoke them now and not next time
Smoke any motherfucker that sweats me
Or any asshole that threatens me
I'm a sniper with a hell of a scope
Taking out a cop or two, they can't cope with me
The motherfuckin' villain that's mad
With potential to get bad as fuck
So I'ma turn it around
Put in my clip, yo, and this is the sound
(Gunshot sounds)
Yeah, somethin' like that
But it all depends on the size of the gat
Taking out a police would make my day
But a nigga like Ren don't give a fuck to say…


[Chorus]
Fuck tha police!
Fuck tha police!
Fuck tha police!
Fuck tha police!

[Skit 2: Cop, Eazy-E, and Dr. Dre]
(Knocking sounds)
Yeah, man, what you need?
Police, open out!
Aww, shit
We have a warrant for Eazy-E's arrest
Get down and put your hands right where I can see 'em!
(Move, motherfucker, move now!)
What the fuck did I do, man? What did I do?
Just shut the fuck up
And get your motherfucking ass on the floor!
(You heard the man, shut the fuck up!)
But I didn't do shit
Man, just shut the fuck up!
Eazy-E, won't you step up to the stand
And tell the jury how you feel about this bullshit?

[Verse 3: Eazy-E & MC Ren]
I'm tired of the motherfuckin' jackin'
Sweating my gang, while I'm chillin' in the shack, and
Shining the light in my face, and for what?
Maybe it's because I kick so much butt
I kick ass, or maybe ‘cause I blast
On a stupid ass nigga when I'm playing with the trigger
Of an Uzi or an AK
‘Cause the police always got somethin' stupid to say
They put out my picture with silence
‘Cause my identity by itself causes violence
The E with the criminal behavior
Yeah, I'm a gangsta, but still I got flavor
Without a gun and a badge, what do you got?
A sucker in a uniform waiting to get shot
By me, or another nigga
And with a gat, it don't matter if he's smaller or bigger
(Size don't mean shit, he's from the old school, fool!)
And as you all know, E's here to rule
Whenever I'm rollin', keep lookin' in the mirror
And ears on cue, yo, so I can hear a
Dumb motherfucker with a gun
And if I'm rollin' off the 8, he'll be the one
That I take out, and then get away
While I'm driving off laughing, this is what I'll say


[Chorus]
Fuck tha police!
Fuck tha police!
Fuck tha police!
Fuck tha police!

Out, right now!
Fuck you, you black motherfuckers!

Stevie Wonder,Living For The City,"[Verse 1]
A boy is born in hard time Mississippi
Surrounded by four walls that ain't so pretty
His parents give him love and affection
To keep him strong moving in the right direction
Living just enough, just enough for the city

[Verse 2]
His father works some days for fourteen hours
And you can bet he barely makes a dollar
His mother goes to scrub the floors for many
And you'd best believe she hardly gets a penny
Living just enough, just enough for the city (yeah)

[Verse 3]
His sister's black but she is sho 'nuff pretty
Her skirt is short but Lord her legs are sturdy
To walk to school she's got to get up early
Her clothes are old but never are they dirty
Living just enough, just enough for the city (um-hum)

[Verse 4]
Her brother's smart he's got more sense than many
His patience's long but soon he won't have any
To find a job is like a haystack needle
Because where he lives they don't use colored people
Living just enough, just enough for the city

His hair is long, his feet are hard and gritty
He spends his life walking the streets of New York City
He's almost dead from breathing in air pollution
He tried and fought but to him there's no solution
Living just enough, just enough for the city

[Verse 6]
I hope you hear inside my voice of sorrow
And that it motivates you to make a better tomorrow
This place is cruel nowhere could be much colder
If we don't change, the world will soon be over
Living just enough, stop giving just enough for the city"

Madness,(Waiting For) The Ghost Train,"A straw headed woman, and a barrel chested man
A pocket full of posies with a hat brim full of sand
Ooh - waiting for the train that never comes

A dog chasing the tumbleweeds, across the sandy floor
That drift along the platform, through the ticket office door
Ooh - waiting for the train that never comes
Ooh - waiting for the train that never comes

But don't tell me there's nothing coming, you don't fool me
I hear the ghost train rumbling along the tracks - set them free
And I hear them
It's black and white don't try to hide
It's black and white don't try to hide

The station master's writing with a piece of orange chalk
A hundred cancellations, still no one wants to walk
Keep the hungry children from the skeletons in the back
Paid to keep an eye out for the gipsy caravan
Ooh - waiting for the train that never comes
Ooh - waiting for the train that never comes

I hear the ghost train rumbling along the tracks - set them free
And I hear them
It's black and white don't try to hide
It's black and white don't try to hide
It's black and white don't try to hide
It's black and white don't try to hide
It's black and white (don't try)

It's black and white don't try to hide

Tom Robinson,Glad To Be Gay,"[Spoken Word Intro]
This song is dedicated to the World Health Organization, its a medical song and it concerns a disease whose classification according to the International Classification of Diseases is 302.0

[Verse 1]
The British Police are the best in the world
I don't believe one of these stories I've heard
'Bout them raiding our pubs for no reason at all
Lining the customers up by the wall
Picking out people and knocking them down
Resisting arrest as they're kicked on the ground
Searching their houses and calling them queer
I don't believe that sort of thing happens here

[Chorus]
Sing if you're glad to be gay
Sing if you're happy that way
(Hey!) Sing if you're glad to be gay
Sing if you're happy that way

[Verse 2]
Pictures of naked young women are fun
In Titbits and Playboy, page three of The Sun
There's no nudes in Gay News, our one magazine
But they still find excuses to call it obscene
Read how disgusting we are in the press
The Telegraph, People and Sunday Express
Molesters of children, corruptors of youth
It's there in the paper, it must be the truth

[Chorus]
(Try and) Sing if you're glad to be gay
Sing if you're happy that way
(Hey!) Sing if you're glad to be gay
Sing if you're happy that way

[Verse 3]
Don't try to kid us that if you're discreet
You're perfectly safe as you walk down the street
You don't have to mince or make bitchy remarks
To get beaten unconscious and left in the dark
I had a friend who was gentle and short
He was lonely one evening and went for a walk
Queerbashers caught him, kicked in his teeth
He was only hospitalised for a week
(And he still bears the scars)

[Chorus]
Sing if you're glad to be gay
Sing if you're happy that way
(Hey!) Sing if you're glad to be gay
Sing if you're happy that way

[Verse 4]
And sit back and watch as they close down our clubs
Arrest us for meeting and raid all our pubs
Make sure your boyfriend's at least 21
So only your friends and your brothers get done
Lie to your workmates, lie to your folks
Put down the queens, tell anti-queer jokes
Gay Lib's ridiculous, join their laughter
'The buggers are legal now, what more are they after?'
(Tell them!)

[Chorus]
Sing if you're glad to be gay
Sing if you're happy that way
(Hey!) Sing if you're glad to be gay
Sing if you're happy that way
Sing if you're glad to be gay
Sing if you're happy that way
(Hey!) Sing if you're glad to be gay
Sing if you're happy this way"

Metallica,One,"[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
I can't remember anything
Can't tell if this is true or a dream
Deep down inside I feel to scream
This terrible silence stops with me
Now that the war is through with me
I'm waking up, I cannot see
That there's not much left of me
Nothing is real but pain now

[Chorus]
Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh please God, wake me

[Verse 2]
Back in the womb it's much too real
In pumps life that I must feel
But can't look forward to reveal
Look to the time when I'll live
Fed through the tube that sticks in me
Just like a wartime novelty
Tied to machines that make me be
Cut this life off from me

[Chorus]
Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh please God, wake me

Now the world is gone, I'm just one
Oh, God help me
Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh please God, help me

[Verse 3]
Darkness imprisoning me
All that I see, absolute horror
I cannot live, I cannot die
Trapped in myself, body my holding cell
Landmine has taken my sight
Taken my speech, taken my hearing
Taken my arms, taken my legs
Taken my soul, left me with life in Hell

Sup up your beer and collect your fags
There's a row going on down near Slough
Get out your mat and pray to the West
I'll get out mine and pray for myself

Thought you were smart when you took them on
But you didn't take a peep in their artillery room
All that rugby puts hairs on your chest
What chance have you got against a tie and a crest?

Hello-hurray, what a nice day
For the Eton Rifles, Eton Rifles
Hello-hurray, I hope rain stops play
For the Eton Rifles, Eton Rifles

Thought you were clever when you lit the fuse
Tore down the House of Commons in your brand new shoes
Composed a revolutionary symphony
Then went to bed with a charming young thing

Hello-hurray, cheers then, mate
It's the Eton Rifles, Eton Rifles
Hello-hurray, an extremist scrape
With the Eton Rifles, Eton Rifles

What a catalyst you turned out to be
Loaded the guns, then you run off home for your tea
Left me standing like a guilty schoolboy

What a catalyst you turned out to be
Loaded the guns, then you run off home for your tea
Left me standing like a naughty schoolboy

We came out of it naturally the worst
Beaten and bloody, and I was sick down my shirt
We were no match for their untamed wit
Though some of the lads said they'd be back next week

To the Eton Rifles, Eton Rifles
Hello-hurray, I'd prefer the plague

Get Up, Stand Up. Life is your right
So we can't give up the fight
Stand up for your right, Lord, Lord
Get Up, Stand Up. Keep on struggling on
Don't give up the fight

[Verse 3: Peter Tosh]
We're sick and tired of your ism and schism game
Die and go to heaven in Jesus' name, Lord
We know when we understand
Almighty God is a living man
You can fool some people sometimes
But you can't fool all the people all the time
So now we see the light
We going to stand up for our right

So you'd better...

[Chorus: The Wailers]
Get Up, Stand Up, stand up for your right
Get Up, Stand Up, don't give up the fight
Get Up, Stand Up, stand up for your right
Get Up, Stand Up, don't give up the fight"
James Brown,Say It Loud,"Uh! With your bad self!

[Hook]
Say it loud: I'm black and I'm proud!
Say it loud: I'm black and I'm proud!

[Verse 1]
Some people say we've got a lot of malice
Some say it's a lot of nerve
But I say we won't quit moving until we get what we deserve
We have been 'buked and we have been scorned
We've been treated bad, talked about as sure as you're born
But just as sure as it takes two eyes to make a pair, ha
Brother we can't quit until we get our share

[Hook]
Say it loud: I'm black and I'm proud!
Say it loud: I'm black and I'm proud!

[Verse 2]
I worked on jobs with my feet and my hands
But all the work I did was for the other man
Now we demand a chance to do things for ourselves
We're tired of beating our head against the wall
And working for someone else

[Hook]
Say it loud: I'm black and I'm proud!
Say it loud: I'm black and I'm proud!

[Bridge]
Ooh-wee, give it to me
All right, you're out of sight
All night, so tough
You're tough and rough
Ooh-wee, uh, you're killing me

[Hook]
Say it loud: I'm black and I'm proud!
Say it loud: I'm black and I'm proud!

[Verse 3]
We demand a chance to do things for ourselves
We're tired of beating our head against the wall
And working for someone else

[Verse 4]
We're people, we like the birds and the bees
We'd rather die on our feet
Than be living on our knees

[Hook]
Say it loud: I'm black and I'm proud!
Say it loud: I'm black and I'm proud!

[Bridge 2]
All right now, good God
You know we can do the boogaloo
Now we can say with the funky talk, and we do
Sometimes we sing and we talk
You know we jump back and do the camel walk
All right now, all right
All right

[Hook]
Say it loud: I'm black and I'm proud!
Say it loud: I'm black and I'm proud!

[Verse 3]
We demand a chance to do things for ourselves

And working for someone else

[Bridge 3]
Ooh-wee, you're killing me
All right, you're out of sight
All right, you're out of sight
Ooh-wee, ah
Ooh-wee, you're killing me
Ooh-wee

Say it loud: I'm black and I'm proud!"
